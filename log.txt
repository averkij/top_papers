[02.11.2024 16:13] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'AAAR-1.0: Assessing AI's Potential to Assist Research' Text: 'Numerous studies have assessed the proficiency of AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), in facilitating everyday tasks such as email writing, question answering, and creative content generation. However, researchers face unique challenges and opportunities in leveraging LLMs for their own work, such as brainstorming research ideas, designing experiments, and writing or reviewing papers. In this study, we introduce AAAR-1.0, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLM performance in three fundamental, expertise-intensive research tasks: (i) EquationInference, assessing the correctness of equations based on the contextual information in paper submissions; (ii) ExperimentDesign, designing experiments to validate research ideas and solutions; (iii) PaperWeakness, identifying weaknesses in paper submissions; and (iv) REVIEWCRITIQUE, identifying each segment in human reviews is deficient or not. AAAR-1.0 differs from prior benchmarks in two key ways: first, it is explicitly research-oriented, with tasks requiring deep domain expertise; second, it is researcher-oriented, mirroring the primary activities that researchers engage in on a daily basis. An evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LLMs reveals their potential as well as limitations in conducting sophisticated research tasks. We will keep iterating AAAR-1.0 to new versions.'
[02.11.2024 16:13] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a linear art piece on a white background featuring an abstract representation of a large language model (LLM) as a surreal, anthropomorphic figure intertwined with various symbols of academic research, such as equations, experiment diagrams, and paper manuscripts. The LLM figure should have a fluid, organic form, with elements like gears and circuitry merging into the symbols of research, symbolizing the integration of AI into academic tasks. Surrounding this figure, depict a fragmented landscape of swirling thoughts and ideas, represented by cloud-like shapes and abstract forms, illustrating the brainstorming process. Include a label on a prominent object in the image that reads: **'AAAR-1.0: Assessing AI's Potential to Assist Research'**.
