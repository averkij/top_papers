[21.10.2024 10:15] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Web Agents with World Models: Learning and Leveraging Environment Dynamics in Web Navigation' Text: 'Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained much attention in building autonomous agents. However, the performance of current LLM-based web agents in long-horizon tasks is far from optimal, often yielding errors such as repeatedly buying a non-refundable flight ticket. By contrast, humans can avoid such an irreversible mistake, as we have an awareness of the potential outcomes (e.g., losing money) of our actions, also known as the "world model". Motivated by this, our study first starts with preliminary analyses, confirming the absence of world models in current LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, etc.). Then, we present a World-model-augmented (WMA) web agent, which simulates the outcomes of its actions for better decision-making. To overcome the challenges in training LLMs as world models predicting next observations, such as repeated elements across observations and long HTML inputs, we propose a transition-focused observation abstraction, where the prediction objectives are free-form natural language descriptions exclusively highlighting important state differences between time steps. Experiments on WebArena and Mind2Web show that our world models improve agents' policy selection without training and demonstrate our agents' cost- and time-efficiency compared to recent tree-search-based agents.'
[21.10.2024 10:15] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a linear art illustration on a white background, depicting a surreal landscape of a digital web interconnected with various abstract elements that represent environment dynamics. Include a central figure of a humanoid agent with a fragmented face, symbolizing the absence of a world model, hovering over paths that diverge into multiple decision-making routes, each leading to different outcomes (e.g., a ticket booth for flights, a money tree, etc.). Integrate elements like floating text boxes showing snippets of natural language descriptions and abstract representations of HTML structures.
