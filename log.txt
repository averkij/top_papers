[22.10.2024 10:13] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'AutoTrain: No-code training for state-of-the-art models' Text: 'With the advancements in open-source models, training (or finetuning) models on custom datasets has become a crucial part of developing solutions which are tailored to specific industrial or open-source applications. Yet, there is no single tool which simplifies the process of training across different types of modalities or tasks. We introduce AutoTrain (aka AutoTrain Advanced) -- an open-source, no code tool/library which can be used to train (or finetune) models for different kinds of tasks such as: large language model (LLM) finetuning, text classification/regression, token classification, sequence-to-sequence task, finetuning of sentence transformers, visual language model (VLM) finetuning, image classification/regression and even classification and regression tasks on tabular data. AutoTrain Advanced is an open-source library providing best practices for training models on custom datasets. The library is available at https://github.com/huggingface/autotrain-advanced. AutoTrain can be used in fully local mode or on cloud machines and works with tens of thousands of models shared on Hugging Face Hub and their variations.'
[22.10.2024 10:14] Response: **Prompt:** Create a linear art piece on a white background that depicts a surreal landscape where abstract representations of models take the form of whimsical, twisting train tracks. Along the tracks, various symbols for data modalities (e.g., books, images, graphs) float in a dreamlike manner. A train made of light travels along the tracks, representing the seamless journey of no-code training. In the foreground, an oversized label reads: *'AutoTrain: No-code training for state-of-the-art models'* in a bold, modern font, symbolizing the central theme of accessible technology in a complex world. The composition should evoke a sense of imaginative exploration in the realm of machine learning and open-source solutions.
