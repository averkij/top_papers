[22.10.2024 08:16] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'PUMA: Empowering Unified MLLM with Multi-granular Visual Generation' Text: 'Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have yielded significant progress in vision-language understanding. Initial attempts have also explored the potential of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for visual content generation. However, existing works have insufficiently addressed the varying granularity demands of different image generation tasks within a unified MLLM paradigm - from the diversity required in text-to-image generation to the precise controllability needed in image manipulation. In this work, we propose PUMA, emPowering Unified MLLM with Multi-grAnular visual generation. PUMA unifies multi-granular visual features as both inputs and outputs of MLLMs, elegantly addressing the different granularity requirements of various image generation tasks within a unified MLLM framework. Following multimodal pretraining and task-specific instruction tuning, PUMA demonstrates proficiency in a wide range of multimodal tasks. This work represents a significant step towards a truly unified MLLM capable of adapting to the granularity demands of various visual tasks. The code and model will be released in https://github.com/rongyaofang/PUMA.'
[22.10.2024 08:16] Response: **Prompt:** Create a linear art illustration on a white background featuring abstract shapes that symbolize a unified multimodal large language model. Incorporate elements that represent visual content generation, such as fragmented images and flowing text, illustrating the concept of varying granularity in image tasks. Include stylized representations of both text-to-image generation and image manipulation using diverse textures and patterns. 

At the bottom of the image, place a text label in a sleek modern font that reads: **"PUMA: Empowering Unified MLLM with Multi-granular Visual Generation."**

Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'CompassJudger-1: All-in-one Judge Model Helps Model Evaluation and Evolution' Text: 'Efficient and accurate evaluation is crucial for the continuous improvement of large language models (LLMs). Among various assessment methods, subjective evaluation has garnered significant attention due to its superior alignment with real-world usage scenarios and human preferences. However, human-based evaluations are costly and lack reproducibility, making precise automated evaluators (judgers) vital in this process. In this report, we introduce CompassJudger-1, the first open-source all-in-one judge LLM. CompassJudger-1 is a general-purpose LLM that demonstrates remarkable versatility. It is capable of: 1. Performing unitary scoring and two-model comparisons as a reward model; 2. Conducting evaluations according to specified formats; 3. Generating critiques; 4. Executing diverse tasks like a general LLM. To assess the evaluation capabilities of different judge models under a unified setting, we have also established JudgerBench, a new benchmark that encompasses various subjective evaluation tasks and covers a wide range of topics. CompassJudger-1 offers a comprehensive solution for various evaluation tasks while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to diverse requirements. Both CompassJudger and JudgerBench are released and available to the research community athttps://github.com/open-compass/CompassJudger. We believe that by open-sourcing these tools, we can foster collaboration and accelerate progress in LLM evaluation methodologies.'
[22.10.2024 08:16] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a linear art illustration on a white background depicting a surreal landscape where various judge-like figures are engaged in whimsical tasks. One figure is holding a large, intricate compass that points in multiple directions at once, symbolizing the multifaceted evaluation capabilities of the CompassJudger-1. Surround it with floating geometric shapes representing different evaluation criteria and human preferences, while abstract text elements swirl around, resembling critiques and scoring formats. In one corner, include a whimsical representation of a benchmark, like a winding road leading to an ethereal horizon.
