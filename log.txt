[25.10.2024 22:11] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Framer: Interactive Frame Interpolation' Text: 'We propose Framer for interactive frame interpolation, which targets producing smoothly transitioning frames between two images as per user creativity. Concretely, besides taking the start and end frames as inputs, our approach supports customizing the transition process by tailoring the trajectory of some selected keypoints. Such a design enjoys two clear benefits. First, incorporating human interaction mitigates the issue arising from numerous possibilities of transforming one image to another, and in turn enables finer control of local motions. Second, as the most basic form of interaction, keypoints help establish the correspondence across frames, enhancing the model to handle challenging cases (e.g., objects on the start and end frames are of different shapes and styles). It is noteworthy that our system also offers an "autopilot" mode, where we introduce a module to estimate the keypoints and refine the trajectory automatically, to simplify the usage in practice. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the appealing performance of Framer on various applications, such as image morphing, time-lapse video generation, cartoon interpolation, etc. The code, the model, and the interface will be released to facilitate further research.'
[25.10.2024 22:11] Response: **Image Prompt:** A surreal depiction of a large, abstract frame hanging in a dreamlike landscape, with fluid, morphing shapes transitioning between two distinct images within the frame. Keypoints are represented as colorful dots connected by delicate, wavy lines that create a sense of motion and interaction. The background features a gradient of soft colors, blending seamlessly to symbolize the smooth transition process. Floating around the frame are stylized representations of various objects in different shapes and styles, emphasizing the theme of transformation. 

**Label Text:** 'Framer: Interactive Frame Interpolation'
