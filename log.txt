[22.10.2024 07:35] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Baichuan Alignment Technical Report' Text: 'We introduce Baichuan Alignment, a detailed analysis of the alignment techniques employed in the Baichuan series of models. This represents the industry's first comprehensive account of alignment methodologies, offering valuable insights for advancing AI research. We investigate the critical components that enhance model performance during the alignment process, including optimization methods, data strategies, capability enhancements, and evaluation processes. The process spans three key stages: Prompt Augmentation System (PAS), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Preference Alignment. The problems encountered, the solutions applied, and the improvements made are thoroughly recorded.   Through comparisons across well-established benchmarks, we highlight the technological advancements enabled by Baichuan Alignment. Baichuan-Instruct is an internal model, while Qwen2-Nova-72B and Llama3-PBM-Nova-70B are instruct versions of the Qwen2-72B and Llama-3-70B base models, optimized through Baichuan Alignment. Baichuan-Instruct demonstrates significant improvements in core capabilities, with user experience gains ranging from 17% to 28%, and performs exceptionally well on specialized benchmarks. In open-source benchmark evaluations, both Qwen2-Nova-72B and Llama3-PBM-Nova-70B consistently outperform their respective official instruct versions across nearly all datasets. This report aims to clarify the key technologies behind the alignment process, fostering a deeper understanding within the community. Llama3-PBM-Nova-70B model is available at https://huggingface.co/PKU-Baichuan-MLSystemLab/Llama3-PBM-Nova-70B.'
[22.10.2024 07:35] Response: **Prompt:** Create a linear art piece on a white background that represents the essence of 'Baichuan Alignment Technical Report'. Depict an abstract, surreal scene where three interconnected stages—Prompt Augmentation System (PAS), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Preference Alignment—are symbolized by flowing pathways or streams, each filled with geometric shapes representing optimization methods, data strategies, and evaluation processes. Include visual metaphors for technological advancements, such as ascending arrows or blooming flowers, illustrating the improvements in model performance. Integrate faint outlines of the models mentioned—Baichuan-Instruct, Qwen2-Nova-72B, and Llama3-PBM-Nova-70B—woven into the background as support structures for the vibrant elements in the foreground. Ensure the overall composition conveys a sense of progression and enlightenment in AI research. Add a label in an elegant font at the bottom of the image that reads: **'Baichuan Alignment: A Journey Through Methodologies and Insights'**.
