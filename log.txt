[28.10.2024 09:28] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'ROCKET-1: Master Open-World Interaction with Visual-Temporal Context Prompting' Text: 'Vision-language models (VLMs) have excelled in multimodal tasks, but adapting them to embodied decision-making in open-world environments presents challenges. A key issue is the difficulty in smoothly connecting individual entities in low-level observations with abstract concepts required for planning. A common approach to address this problem is through the use of hierarchical agents, where VLMs serve as high-level reasoners that break down tasks into executable sub-tasks, typically specified using language and imagined observations. However, language often fails to effectively convey spatial information, while generating future images with sufficient accuracy remains challenging. To address these limitations, we propose visual-temporal context prompting, a novel communication protocol between VLMs and policy models. This protocol leverages object segmentation from both past and present observations to guide policy-environment interactions. Using this approach, we train ROCKET-1, a low-level policy that predicts actions based on concatenated visual observations and segmentation masks, with real-time object tracking provided by SAM-2. Our method unlocks the full potential of VLMs visual-language reasoning abilities, enabling them to solve complex creative tasks, especially those heavily reliant on spatial understanding. Experiments in Minecraft demonstrate that our approach allows agents to accomplish previously unattainable tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of visual-temporal context prompting in embodied decision-making. Codes and demos will be available on the project page: https://craftjarvis.github.io/ROCKET-1.'
[28.10.2024 09:28] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a linear art illustration on a white background depicting an abstract representation of a rocket launching into a surreal open-world environment. The rocket, labeled "ROCKET-1," is visually fragmented, with each part symbolizing elements of vision-language models and spatial reasoning. Surrounding the rocket, integrate abstract shapes and symbols representing low-level observations, high-level reasoning, and hierarchical agents, intertwined with flowing lines that suggest temporal movement and connection. Include visual elements that evoke the complexity of decision-making in dynamic environments, such as fragmented landscapes, geometric patterns, and ethereal forms.
