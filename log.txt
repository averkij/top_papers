Add paper title somewhere as en easter egg. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'MixEval-X: Any-to-Any Evaluations from Real-World Data Mixtures' Text: 'Perceiving and generating diverse modalities are crucial for AI models to effectively learn from and engage with real-world signals, necessitating reliable evaluations for their development. We identify two major issues in current evaluations: (1) inconsistent standards, shaped by different communities with varying protocols and maturity levels; and (2) significant query, grading, and generalization biases. To address these, we introduce MixEval-X, the first any-to-any real-world benchmark designed to optimize and standardize evaluations across input and output modalities. We propose multi-modal benchmark mixture and adaptation-rectification pipelines to reconstruct real-world task distributions, ensuring evaluations generalize effectively to real-world use cases. Extensive meta-evaluations show our approach effectively aligns benchmark samples with real-world task distributions and the model rankings correlate strongly with that of crowd-sourced real-world evaluations (up to 0.98). We provide comprehensive leaderboards to rerank existing models and organizations and offer insights to enhance understanding of multi-modal evaluations and inform future research.'
[18.10.2024 14:57] Generating image by prompt: **Image Prompt:** Create a surreal landscape where disjointed multicolored fragments of data streams flow like rivers through an ethereal terrain. In the background, giant, abstract sculptures represent various AI models, each uniquely designed to embody different modalities—text, image, audio—intertwining in a dance of diversity. Clouds shaped like question marks hover above, casting shadows of grading scales and inconsistency. A central figure stands, holding an oversized mixer blending these elements together, symbolizing the MixEval-X concept. Scattered throughout the scene are ethereal banners with the title '**MixEval-X: Any-to-Any Evaluations from Real-World Data Mixtures**' hidden within the clouds, inviting viewers to discover the connection between evaluation and reality. The colors should reflect a blend of chaos and harmony, evoking a sense of both confusion and clarity in the evaluation processes of AI..
