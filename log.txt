[29.10.2024 18:17] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'COAT: Compressing Optimizer states and Activation for Memory-Efficient FP8 Training' Text: 'FP8 training has emerged as a promising method for improving training efficiency. Existing frameworks accelerate training by applying FP8 computation to linear layers while leaving optimizer states and activations in higher precision, which fails to fully optimize memory usage. This paper introduces COAT (Compressing Optimizer States and Activations for FP8 Training), a novel FP8 training framework designed to significantly reduce memory footprint when training large models. COAT addresses current limitations through two key innovations: (1) Dynamic Range Expansion, which aligns optimizer state distributions more closely with the FP8 representation range, thereby reducing quantization error, and (2) Mixed-Granularity Activation Quantization, which optimizes activation memory using a combination of per-tensor and per-group quantization strategies. Experiments demonstrate that COAT effectively reduces end-to-end training memory footprint by 1.54x compared to BF16 while achieving nearly lossless performance across various tasks, such as Large Language Model pretraining and fine-tuning and Vision Language Model training. COAT also achieves a 1.43x end-to-end training speedup compared to BF16, performing on par with or surpassing TransformerEngine's speedup. COAT enables efficient full-parameter training of large models on fewer GPUs, and facilitates doubling the batch size in distributed training settings, providing a practical solution for scaling large-scale model training. The code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/COAT.'
[29.10.2024 18:17] Response: **Prompt:** Create a linear art piece on a white background that embodies the surrealism and modern art themes of efficiency and transformation in the realm of machine learning. Illustrate a large, abstract coat made of swirling, intertwined lines that represent optimizer states and activations. Incorporate elements that symbolize memory, such as floating memory chips or ethereal clouds of data, merging with the coat. Include dynamic shapes that suggest expansion and compression, like balloons and squeezed tubes. 

Label this object in the image with the following text in a bold, minimalist font: **"COAT: Compressing Optimizer States and Activation for Memory-Efficient FP8 Training."**
