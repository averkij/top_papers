[19.10.2024 06:42] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Harnessing Webpage UIs for Text-Rich Visual Understanding' Text: 'Text-rich visual understanding-the ability to process environments where dense textual content is integrated with visuals-is crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to interact effectively with structured environments. To enhance this capability, we propose synthesizing general multimodal instructions from webpage UIs using text-based large language models (LLMs). Despite lacking direct visual input, text-based LLMs are able to process structured text representations from webpage accessibility trees. These instructions are then paired with UI screenshots to train multimodal models. We introduce MultiUI, a dataset containing 7.3 million samples from 1 million websites, covering diverse multimodal tasks and UI layouts. Models trained on MultiUI not only excel in web UI tasks-achieving up to a 48\% improvement on VisualWebBench and a 19.1\% boost in action accuracy on a web agent dataset Mind2Web-but also generalize surprisingly well to non-web UI tasks and even to non-UI domains, such as document understanding, OCR, and chart interpretation. These results highlight the broad applicability of web UI data for advancing text-rich visual understanding across various scenarios.'
[19.10.2024 06:42] Generating image by prompt: **Prompt:** Create a surreal image featuring a dreamlike interface merging webpages with abstract visuals, where text flows like water through the UI elements, morphing shapes and colors. Include UI screenshots distorted in a whimsical way to reflect their functionalities, intertwined with organic forms like trees and flowers to signify growth in understanding. Floating above this scene, place a label in a bold, modern font that reads: "Harnessing Webpage UIs for Text-Rich Visual Understanding." The background should be a vibrant blend of colors, evoking a sense of creative energy and exploration in the digital landscape..
