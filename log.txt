[30.10.2024 18:17] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Flow-DPO: Improving LLM Mathematical Reasoning through Online Multi-Agent Learning' Text: 'Mathematical reasoning is a crucial capability for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet generating detailed and accurate reasoning traces remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach to produce high-quality reasoning traces for LLM fine-tuning using online learning Flows. Our method employs an incremental output production Flow, where component LLMs collaboratively construct solutions through iterative communication. We train the Flow using online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) learning with rollouts, generating DPO pairs for each training example and updating models in real-time. We directly compare the quality of reasoning traces generated by our method with those produced through direct model inference, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in improving LLM performance in mathematical reasoning tasks.'
[30.10.2024 18:17] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a linear art illustration on a white background depicting a surreal landscape where abstract representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) are personified as interconnected floating spheres. Each sphere symbolizes a component LLM, communicating and exchanging mathematical symbols and reasoning traces through vibrant, flowing lines that resemble a stream or river of thought. In the center, a larger sphere represents the Flow mechanism, radiating light and energy, symbolizing the collaborative construction of solutions. Surround the scene with chaotic, yet harmonious, mathematical equations and symbols that intermingle and transform, suggesting the iterative nature of the problem-solving process.
