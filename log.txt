[28.10.2024 10:28] [Experimental] Generating an image for paper Continuous Speech Synthesis using per-token Latent Diffusion.
[28.10.2024 10:28] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Continuous Speech Synthesis using per-token Latent Diffusion' Text: 'The success of autoregressive transformer models with discrete tokens has inspired quantization-based approaches for continuous modalities, though these often limit reconstruction quality. We therefore introduce SALAD, a per-token latent diffusion model for zero-shot text-to-speech, that operates on continuous representations. SALAD builds upon the recently proposed expressive diffusion head for image generation, and extends it to generate variable-length outputs. Our approach utilizes semantic tokens for providing contextual information and determining the stopping condition. We suggest three continuous variants for our method, extending popular discrete speech synthesis techniques. Additionally, we implement discrete baselines for each variant and conduct a comparative analysis of discrete versus continuous speech modeling techniques. Our results demonstrate that both continuous and discrete approaches are highly competent, and that SALAD achieves a superior intelligibility score while obtaining speech quality and speaker similarity on par with the ground-truth audio.'

Title: 'Infinity-MM: Scaling Multimodal Performance with Large-Scale and High-Quality Instruction Data' Text: 'Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently made significant progress, but the limited scale and quality of open-source instruction data hinder their performance compared to closed-source models. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing Infinity-MM, a large-scale multimodal instruction dataset with 40 million samples, enhanced through rigorous quality filtering and deduplication. We also propose a synthetic instruction generation method based on open-source VLMs, using detailed image annotations and diverse question generation. Using this data, we trained a 2-billion-parameter VLM, Aquila-VL-2B, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for models of similar scale. This demonstrates that expanding instruction data and generating synthetic data can significantly improve the performance of open-source models.'

Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Teach Multimodal LLMs to Comprehend Electrocardiographic Images' Text: 'The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential non-invasive diagnostic tool for assessing cardiac conditions. Existing automatic interpretation methods suffer from limited generalizability, focusing on a narrow range of cardiac conditions, and typically depend on raw physiological signals, which may not be readily available in resource-limited settings where only printed or digital ECG images are accessible. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) present promising opportunities for addressing these challenges. However, the application of MLLMs to ECG image interpretation remains challenging due to the lack of instruction tuning datasets and well-established ECG image benchmarks for quantitative evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce ECGInstruct, a comprehensive ECG image instruction tuning dataset of over one million samples, covering a wide range of ECG-related tasks from diverse data sources. Using ECGInstruct, we develop PULSE, an MLLM tailored for ECG image comprehension. In addition, we curate ECGBench, a new evaluation benchmark covering four key ECG image interpretation tasks across nine different datasets. Our experiments show that PULSE sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming general MLLMs with an average accuracy improvement of 15% to 30%. This work highlights the potential of PULSE to enhance ECG interpretation in clinical practice.'
