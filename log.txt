Title: 'LOGO -- Long cOntext aliGnment via efficient preference Optimization' Text: 'Long-context models(LCMs) have shown great potential in processing long input sequences(even more than 100M tokens) conveniently and effectively. With significant progress, recent research has pointed out that LCMs can accurately locate token-level salient information within the context. Yet, the generation performance of these LCMs is far from satisfactory and might result in misaligned responses, such as hallucinations. To enhance the generation capability of LCMs, existing works have investigated the effects of data size and quality for both pre-training and instruction tuning. Though achieving meaningful improvement, previous methods fall short in either effectiveness or efficiency. In this paper, we introduce LOGO(Long cOntext aliGnment via efficient preference Optimization), a training strategy that first introduces preference optimization for long-context alignment. To overcome the GPU memory-bound issue caused by the long sequence, LOGO employs a reference-free preference optimization strategy and adopts a position synthesis method to construct the training data. By training with only 0.3B data on a single 8timesA800 GPU machine for 16 hours, LOGO allows the Llama-3-8B-Instruct-80K model to achieve comparable performance with GPT-4 in real-world long-context tasks while preserving the model's original capabilities on other tasks, e.g., language modeling and MMLU. Moreover, LOGO can extend the model's context window size while enhancing its generation performance.'

Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Breaking the Memory Barrier: Near Infinite Batch Size Scaling for Contrastive Loss' Text: 'Contrastive loss is a powerful approach for representation learning, where larger batch sizes enhance performance by providing more negative samples to better distinguish between similar and dissimilar data. However, scaling batch sizes is constrained by the quadratic growth in GPU memory consumption, primarily due to the full instantiation of the similarity matrix. To address this, we propose a tile-based computation strategy that partitions the contrastive loss calculation into arbitrary small blocks, avoiding full materialization of the similarity matrix. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level tiling strategy to leverage the hierarchical structure of distributed systems, employing ring-based communication at the GPU level to optimize synchronization and fused kernels at the CUDA core level to reduce I/O overhead. Experimental results show that the proposed method scales batch sizes to unprecedented levels. For instance, it enables contrastive training of a CLIP-ViT-L/14 model with a batch size of 4M or 12M using 8 or 32 A800 80GB without sacrificing any accuracy. Compared to SOTA memory-efficient solutions, it achieves a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in memory while maintaining comparable speed. The code will be made publicly available.'

The landscape is composed of floating geometric shapes representing data points, interspersed with ethereal tiles symbolizing the tile-based computation strategy. Visualize a distorted similarity matrix as a cascading waterfall flowing down, embodying the concept of memory constraints. Incorporate abstract representations of GPUs as large, gleaming crystals, connected by intricate lines of light symbolizing ring-based communication. In the foreground, a giant, open book with pages fluttering like wings, symbolizing knowledge and innovation, rests atop a pedestal made of binary code.
