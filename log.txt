Title: 'PyramidDrop: Accelerating Your Large Vision-Language Models via Pyramid Visual Redundancy Reduction' Text: 'In large vision-language models (LVLMs), images serve as inputs that carry a wealth of information. As the idiom "A picture is worth a thousand words" implies, representing a single image in current LVLMs can require hundreds or even thousands of tokens. This results in significant computational costs, which grow quadratically as input image resolution increases, thereby severely impacting the efficiency of both training and inference. Previous approaches have attempted to reduce the number of image tokens either before or within the early layers of LVLMs. However, these strategies inevitably result in the loss of crucial image information, ultimately diminishing model performance. To address this challenge, we conduct an empirical study revealing that all visual tokens are necessary for LVLMs in the shallow layers, and token redundancy progressively increases in the deeper layers of the model. To this end, we propose PyramidDrop, a visual redundancy reduction strategy for LVLMs to boost their efficiency in both training and inference with neglectable performance loss. Specifically, we partition the LVLM into several stages and drop part of the image tokens at the end of each stage with a pre-defined ratio, creating pyramid-like visual tokens across model layers. The dropping is based on a lightweight similarity calculation with a negligible time overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PyramidDrop can achieve a 40% training time and 55% inference FLOPs acceleration of LLaVA-NeXT with comparable performance. Besides, the PyramidDrop could also serve as a plug-and-play strategy for inference acceleration without training, with better performance and lower inference cost than counterparts. We hope that the insights and approach introduced by PyramidDrop will inspire future research to further investigate the role of image tokens in LVLMs.'
[23.10.2024 09:59] Response: **Prompt:** Create a linear art image on a white background depicting a surreal scene where a giant pyramid made of floating, fragmented images drips like melting wax. Each image fragment represents different visual tokens, symbolizing layers of information. At the base of the pyramid, a cascade of digital tokens flows downward, resembling a waterfall of data. Surrounding the pyramid, faint outlines of abstract figures contemplate the structure, embodying the tension between computational efficiency and the loss of information. In the foreground, label an object (like a small, stylized block) with the text: "PyramidDrop: Accelerating Your Large Vision-Language Models via Pyramid Visual Redundancy Reduction."

Title: 'SpectroMotion: Dynamic 3D Reconstruction of Specular Scenes' Text: 'We present SpectroMotion, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with physically-based rendering (PBR) and deformation fields to reconstruct dynamic specular scenes. Previous methods extending 3DGS to model dynamic scenes have struggled to accurately represent specular surfaces. Our method addresses this limitation by introducing a residual correction technique for accurate surface normal computation during deformation, complemented by a deformable environment map that adapts to time-varying lighting conditions. We implement a coarse-to-fine training strategy that significantly enhances both scene geometry and specular color prediction. We demonstrate that our model outperforms prior methods for view synthesis of scenes containing dynamic specular objects and that it is the only existing 3DGS method capable of synthesizing photorealistic real-world dynamic specular scenes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering complex, dynamic, and specular scenes.'
[23.10.2024 09:59] Response: **Image Prompt**: Create a linear art piece on a white background that encapsulates the essence of dynamic 3D reconstruction and specular scenes. Visualize abstract forms representing 3D Gaussian splats emerging and morphing, interspersed with fluid, reflective surfaces that shift in color and form to symbolize dynamic lighting conditions. Integrate elements that suggest the concept of deformation fields, such as wavy lines or distorted shapes, to convey movement and change. Include a central object that embodies the idea of a 'deformable environment map', with various textures that represent time-varying light interactions. The overall composition should evoke a sense of depth and flow, capturing the surreal quality of specular reflections and dynamic scenes.
