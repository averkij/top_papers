[20.10.2024 08:15] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Fluid: Scaling Autoregressive Text-to-image Generative Models with Continuous Tokens' Text: 'Scaling up autoregressive models in vision has not proven as beneficial as in large language models. In this work, we investigate this scaling problem in the context of text-to-image generation, focusing on two critical factors: whether models use discrete or continuous tokens, and whether tokens are generated in a random or fixed raster order using BERT- or GPT-like transformer architectures. Our empirical results show that, while all models scale effectively in terms of validation loss, their evaluation performance -- measured by FID, GenEval score, and visual quality -- follows different trends. Models based on continuous tokens achieve significantly better visual quality than those using discrete tokens. Furthermore, the generation order and attention mechanisms significantly affect the GenEval score: random-order models achieve notably better GenEval scores compared to raster-order models. Inspired by these findings, we train Fluid, a random-order autoregressive model on continuous tokens. Fluid 10.5B model achieves a new state-of-the-art zero-shot FID of 6.16 on MS-COCO 30K, and 0.69 overall score on the GenEval benchmark. We hope our findings and results will encourage future efforts to further bridge the scaling gap between vision and language models.'
[20.10.2024 08:15] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a surreal landscape where fluid forms merge and transform into abstract representations of text and imagery. Imagine a giant, flowing ribbon of text that twists and spirals, reflecting the continuous token concept, interspersed with vivid, dreamlike images symbolizing the generative process. Include ethereal shapes resembling both discrete and continuous tokens, with some appearing as clear geometric forms while others are amorphous and shifting. In the background, a distorted clock represents the random order of generation, with the hands swirling chaotically. The color palette should be vibrant and dynamic, conveying a sense of motion and innovation.
