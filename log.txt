[21.10.2024 12:24] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'UCFE: A User-Centric Financial Expertise Benchmark for Large Language Models' Text: 'This paper introduces the UCFE: User-Centric Financial Expertise benchmark, an innovative framework designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to handle complex real-world financial tasks. UCFE benchmark adopts a hybrid approach that combines human expert evaluations with dynamic, task-specific interactions to simulate the complexities of evolving financial scenarios. Firstly, we conducted a user study involving 804 participants, collecting their feedback on financial tasks. Secondly, based on this feedback, we created our dataset that encompasses a wide range of user intents and interactions. This dataset serves as the foundation for benchmarking 12 LLM services using the LLM-as-Judge methodology. Our results show a significant alignment between benchmark scores and human preferences, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78, confirming the effectiveness of the UCFE dataset and our evaluation approach. UCFE benchmark not only reveals the potential of LLMs in the financial sector but also provides a robust framework for assessing their performance and user satisfaction.The benchmark dataset and evaluation code are available.'
[21.10.2024 12:24] Response: **Prompt:** Create a linear art image on a white background, featuring an abstract representation of a financial landscape. Include surreal elements such as a giant calculator with human figures debating around it, floating coins, and a tree made of banknotes. In the foreground, depict a large open book with pages turning into digital data streams. Incorporate a visual metaphor of a scale balancing user feedback and financial tasks. Label the scene with the text: "UCFE: A User-Centric Financial Expertise Benchmark for Large Language Models."
