[26.10.2024 04:15] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Unbounded: A Generative Infinite Game of Character Life Simulation' Text: 'We introduce the concept of a generative infinite game, a video game that transcends the traditional boundaries of finite, hard-coded systems by using generative models. Inspired by James P. Carse's distinction between finite and infinite games, we leverage recent advances in generative AI to create Unbounded: a game of character life simulation that is fully encapsulated in generative models. Specifically, Unbounded draws inspiration from sandbox life simulations and allows you to interact with your autonomous virtual character in a virtual world by feeding, playing with and guiding it - with open-ended mechanics generated by an LLM, some of which can be emergent. In order to develop Unbounded, we propose technical innovations in both the LLM and visual generation domains. Specifically, we present: (1) a specialized, distilled large language model (LLM) that dynamically generates game mechanics, narratives, and character interactions in real-time, and (2) a new dynamic regional image prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) for vision models that ensures consistent yet flexible visual generation of a character across multiple environments. We evaluate our system through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, showing significant improvements in character life simulation, user instruction following, narrative coherence, and visual consistency for both characters and the environments compared to traditional related approaches.'
[26.10.2024 04:15] Response: **Prompt:** Create a linear art piece on a white background depicting a surreal, abstract world where characters float freely, symbolizing the infinite nature of life simulation. Visualize a character in the center, surrounded by swirling lines that represent generative mechanics and narratives. Include elements like floating game mechanics and scenes from different environments that morph seamlessly into one another. Overlay the image with the title "Unbounded: A Generative Infinite Game of Character Life Simulation" as if it were a label on a surreal object within the scene, emphasizing the interplay of structure and chaos in character interactions.
