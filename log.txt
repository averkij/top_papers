[29.10.2024 16:15] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'A Survey of Small Language Models' Text: 'Small Language Models (SLMs) have become increasingly important due to their efficiency and performance to perform various language tasks with minimal computational resources, making them ideal for various settings including on-device, mobile, edge devices, among many others. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on SLMs, focusing on their architectures, training techniques, and model compression techniques. We propose a novel taxonomy for categorizing the methods used to optimize SLMs, including model compression, pruning, and quantization techniques. We summarize the benchmark datasets that are useful for benchmarking SLMs along with the evaluation metrics commonly used. Additionally, we highlight key open challenges that remain to be addressed. Our survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in developing and deploying small yet efficient language models.'
[29.10.2024 16:15] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a linear art piece on a white background that visually represents the themes of Small Language Models (SLMs). Depict a series of interconnected geometric shapes symbolizing efficiency and performance, with smaller models branching out in intricate patterns that represent various architectures and training techniques. Incorporate abstract representations of compression methods like pruning and quantization, using lines and shapes that convey the idea of optimization and resourcefulness. Include floating text as a label on an object within the image that reads: "A Survey of Small Language Models".
