[31.10.2024 04:16] [Experimental] Generating an image for paper CORAL: Benchmarking Multi-turn Conversational Retrieval-Augmentation Generation.
[31.10.2024 04:16] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'CORAL: Benchmarking Multi-turn Conversational Retrieval-Augmentation Generation' Text: 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) through external knowledge retrieval. Despite its widespread attention, existing academic research predominantly focuses on single-turn RAG, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexities of multi-turn conversations found in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce CORAL, a large-scale benchmark designed to assess RAG systems in realistic multi-turn conversational settings. CORAL includes diverse information-seeking conversations automatically derived from Wikipedia and tackles key challenges such as open-domain coverage, knowledge intensity, free-form responses, and topic shifts. It supports three core tasks of conversational RAG: passage retrieval, response generation, and citation labeling. We propose a unified framework to standardize various conversational RAG methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of these methods on CORAL, demonstrating substantial opportunities for improving existing approaches.'
[31.10.2024 04:16] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a linear art composition on a white background that visually represents the concept of 'CORAL: Benchmarking Multi-turn Conversational Retrieval-Augmentation Generation'. The artwork should feature surreal elements like floating coral structures intertwined with abstract representations of language (such as speech bubbles, text fragments, and question marks) cascading like ocean waves. Include symbols of knowledge retrieval, such as open books and digital screens, scattered among the coral, reflecting the theme of multi-turn conversations. Integrate visual motifs for complexity, like twisting pathways and overlapping dialogues, to symbolize the challenges of topic shifts and knowledge intensity. 

**Label Text:** "CORAL: Bridging the Gap in Multi-turn Conversational Retrieval"
