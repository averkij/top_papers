[31.10.2024 18:33] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Decoding Reading Goals from Eye Movements' Text: 'Readers can have different goals with respect to the text they are reading. Can these goals be decoded from the pattern of their eye movements over the text? In this work, we examine for the first time whether it is possible to decode two types of reading goals that are common in daily life: information seeking and ordinary reading. Using large scale eye-tracking data, we apply to this task a wide range of state-of-the-art models for eye movements and text that cover different architectural and data representation strategies, and further introduce a new model ensemble. We systematically evaluate these models at three levels of generalization: new textual item, new participant, and the combination of both. We find that eye movements contain highly valuable signals for this task. We further perform an error analysis which builds on prior empirical findings on differences between ordinary reading and information seeking and leverages rich textual annotations. This analysis reveals key properties of textual items and participant eye movements that contribute to the difficulty of the task.'
[31.10.2024 18:33] Response: **Image Prompt:**

Create a linear art illustration on a white background that visually represents the concepts of reading goals and eye movements. The image should feature abstract shapes that symbolize different reading goals, such as an eye with swirling lines representing information seeking, contrasted with a more linear path suggesting ordinary reading. Include fragmented text elements that float around the central eye motif, signifying the decoding process of eye movements. 

Add a label at the bottom of the image that reads: **"Decoding Reading Goals from Eye Movements"**. The label should be in a modern, minimalist font, harmonizing with the overall surrealistic and abstract design.
