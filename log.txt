[29.10.2024 10:13] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Document Parsing Unveiled: Techniques, Challenges, and Prospects for Structured Information Extraction' Text: 'Document parsing is essential for converting unstructured and semi-structured documents-such as contracts, academic papers, and invoices-into structured, machine-readable data. Document parsing extract reliable structured data from unstructured inputs, providing huge convenience for numerous applications. Especially with recent achievements in Large Language Models, document parsing plays an indispensable role in both knowledge base construction and training data generation. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the current state of document parsing, covering key methodologies, from modular pipeline systems to end-to-end models driven by large vision-language models. Core components such as layout detection, content extraction (including text, tables, and mathematical expressions), and multi-modal data integration are examined in detail. Additionally, this paper discusses the challenges faced by modular document parsing systems and vision-language models in handling complex layouts, integrating multiple modules, and recognizing high-density text. It emphasizes the importance of developing larger and more diverse datasets and outlines future research directions.'
[29.10.2024 10:13] Response: **Prompt:** Create a linear art piece on a white background that visually represents the concept of document parsing. Incorporate surreal elements such as fragmented documents floating in a dreamlike space, with abstract representations of modular systems and large language models. Include visual metaphors for structured data and unstructured inputs, like tangled wires transforming into neatly organized nodes. Integrate elements like clocks to symbolize the ongoing challenges and the passage of time in developing parsing techniques. Add a label in a minimalist font that reads: "Document Parsing Unveiled: Techniques, Challenges, and Prospects for Structured Information Extraction."
