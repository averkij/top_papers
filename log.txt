[29.10.2024 12:24] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'MarDini: Masked Autoregressive Diffusion for Video Generation at Scale' Text: 'We introduce MarDini, a new family of video diffusion models that integrate the advantages of masked auto-regression (MAR) into a unified diffusion model (DM) framework. Here, MAR handles temporal planning, while DM focuses on spatial generation in an asymmetric network design: i) a MAR-based planning model containing most of the parameters generates planning signals for each masked frame using low-resolution input; ii) a lightweight generation model uses these signals to produce high-resolution frames via diffusion de-noising. MarDini's MAR enables video generation conditioned on any number of masked frames at any frame positions: a single model can handle video interpolation (e.g., masking middle frames), image-to-video generation (e.g., masking from the second frame onward), and video expansion (e.g., masking half the frames). The efficient design allocates most of the computational resources to the low-resolution planning model, making computationally expensive but important spatio-temporal attention feasible at scale. MarDini sets a new state-of-the-art for video interpolation; meanwhile, within few inference steps, it efficiently generates videos on par with those of much more expensive advanced image-to-video models.'
[29.10.2024 12:24] Response: **Prompt:** Create a surrealistic linear art piece on a white background that embodies the themes of innovation and transformation in video generation. Visualize a fragmented landscape where various frames of a video morph into one another, symbolizing the transition from low-resolution planning to high-resolution generation. Integrate abstract representations of masks and auto-regressive patterns weaving through the scene, hinting at the complexity of temporal planning and spatial generation. Include a central object, perhaps a stylized video camera, emitting beams of light that represent diffusion and de-noising processes.

**Label:** 'MarDini: Masked Autoregressive Diffusion for Video Generation at Scale'
