[03.11.2024 02:51] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Learning Video Representations without Natural Videos' Text: 'In this paper, we show that useful video representations can be learned from synthetic videos and natural images, without incorporating natural videos in the training. We propose a progression of video datasets synthesized by simple generative processes, that model a growing set of natural video properties (e.g. motion, acceleration, and shape transformations). The downstream performance of video models pre-trained on these generated datasets gradually increases with the dataset progression. A VideoMAE model pre-trained on our synthetic videos closes 97.2% of the performance gap on UCF101 action classification between training from scratch and self-supervised pre-training from natural videos, and outperforms the pre-trained model on HMDB51. Introducing crops of static images to the pre-training stage results in similar performance to UCF101 pre-training and outperforms the UCF101 pre-trained model on 11 out of 14 out-of-distribution datasets of UCF101-P. Analyzing the low-level properties of the datasets, we identify correlations between frame diversity, frame similarity to natural data, and downstream performance. Our approach provides a more controllable and transparent alternative to video data curation processes for pre-training.'
[03.11.2024 02:51] Response: **Prompt:** Create a linear art piece on a white background that visually represents the concept of learning video representations without natural videos. Illustrate a surreal landscape where synthetic videos are depicted as colorful, geometric shapes and patterns that evolve through stages of complexity—symbolizing the progression of synthesized video datasets. Incorporate elements such as flowing lines representing motion, spirals that signify acceleration, and abstract forms that convey shape transformations. Include a juxtaposition of static images represented as crops within this dynamic environment, demonstrating their role in enhancing video model performance. At the center, include a label styled as a title for an object within the artwork that reads: "Learning Video Representations without Natural Videos."
