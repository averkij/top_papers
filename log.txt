[18.10.2024 18:51] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'MixEval-X: Any-to-Any Evaluations from Real-World Data Mixtures' Text: 'Perceiving and generating diverse modalities are crucial for AI models to effectively learn from and engage with real-world signals, necessitating reliable evaluations for their development. We identify two major issues in current evaluations: (1) inconsistent standards, shaped by different communities with varying protocols and maturity levels; and (2) significant query, grading, and generalization biases. To address these, we introduce MixEval-X, the first any-to-any real-world benchmark designed to optimize and standardize evaluations across input and output modalities. We propose multi-modal benchmark mixture and adaptation-rectification pipelines to reconstruct real-world task distributions, ensuring evaluations generalize effectively to real-world use cases. Extensive meta-evaluations show our approach effectively aligns benchmark samples with real-world task distributions and the model rankings correlate strongly with that of crowd-sourced real-world evaluations (up to 0.98). We provide comprehensive leaderboards to rerank existing models and organizations and offer insights to enhance understanding of multi-modal evaluations and inform future research.'
[18.10.2024 18:51] Generating image by prompt: **Image Prompt:** Create a surrealistic and modern art piece depicting an abstract landscape where various communication tools (like smartphones, books, and speech bubbles) are intertwined with organic shapes (like trees and clouds) that morph into different artificial intelligence symbols (like gears and neural networks). The color palette should be bold and diverse, illustrating the theme of multi-modality. In the foreground, illustrate a large, distorted scale balancing elements labeled with inconsistent evaluation standards and biases, symbolizing the need for optimization and standardization in AI evaluations. 

**Label Text:** "MixEval-X: Any-to-Any Evaluations from Real-World Data Mixtures".

[18.10.2024 18:51] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Movie Gen: A Cast of Media Foundation Models' Text: 'We present Movie Gen, a cast of foundation models that generates high-quality, 1080p HD videos with different aspect ratios and synchronized audio. We also show additional capabilities such as precise instruction-based video editing and generation of personalized videos based on a user's image. Our models set a new state-of-the-art on multiple tasks: text-to-video synthesis, video personalization, video editing, video-to-audio generation, and text-to-audio generation. Our largest video generation model is a 30B parameter transformer trained with a maximum context length of 73K video tokens, corresponding to a generated video of 16 seconds at 16 frames-per-second. We show multiple technical innovations and simplifications on the architecture, latent spaces, training objectives and recipes, data curation, evaluation protocols, parallelization techniques, and inference optimizations that allow us to reap the benefits of scaling pre-training data, model size, and training compute for training large scale media generation models. We hope this paper helps the research community to accelerate progress and innovation in media generation models. All videos from this paper are available at https://go.fb.me/MovieGenResearchVideos.'
[18.10.2024 18:51] Generating image by prompt: **Prompt:** Create a surrealist image depicting a dreamlike landscape where gigantic film reels twist and spiral into the sky, each projecting vibrant 1080p HD videos onto billowing clouds. In the foreground, a collage of diverse faces morphs into digital data streams, representing personalized video generation. Meanwhile, an ethereal figure hovers, wielding a paintbrush that paints with streams of audio waves. The color palette should be vivid, with iridescent and neon tones blending seamlessly. Overlay the image with the following label in an artistic font: **'Movie Gen: A Cast of Media Foundation Models'**.

Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'MobA: A Two-Level Agent System for Efficient Mobile Task Automation' Text: 'Current mobile assistants are limited by dependence on system APIs or struggle with complex user instructions and diverse interfaces due to restricted comprehension and decision-making abilities. To address these challenges, we propose MobA, a novel Mobile phone Agent powered by multimodal large language models that enhances comprehension and planning capabilities through a sophisticated two-level agent architecture. The high-level Global Agent (GA) is responsible for understanding user commands, tracking history memories, and planning tasks. The low-level Local Agent (LA) predicts detailed actions in the form of function calls, guided by sub-tasks and memory from the GA. Integrating a Reflection Module allows for efficient task completion and enables the system to handle previously unseen complex tasks. MobA demonstrates significant improvements in task execution efficiency and completion rate in real-life evaluations, underscoring the potential of MLLM-empowered mobile assistants.'

Use dreamlike colors and distorted perspectives to enhance the surrealism, with a shadowy Reflection Module hovering above, reflecting fragmented memories and tasks.
