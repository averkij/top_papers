[04.11.2024 14:12] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Constant Acceleration Flow' Text: 'Rectified flow and reflow procedures have significantly advanced fast generation by progressively straightening ordinary differential equation (ODE) flows. They operate under the assumption that image and noise pairs, known as couplings, can be approximated by straight trajectories with constant velocity. However, we observe that modeling with constant velocity and using reflow procedures have limitations in accurately learning straight trajectories between pairs, resulting in suboptimal performance in few-step generation. To address these limitations, we introduce Constant Acceleration Flow (CAF), a novel framework based on a simple constant acceleration equation. CAF introduces acceleration as an additional learnable variable, allowing for more expressive and accurate estimation of the ODE flow. Moreover, we propose two techniques to further improve estimation accuracy: initial velocity conditioning for the acceleration model and a reflow process for the initial velocity. Our comprehensive studies on toy datasets, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet 64x64 demonstrate that CAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for one-step generation. We also show that CAF dramatically improves few-step coupling preservation and inversion over Rectified flow. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/CAF{https://github.com/mlvlab/CAF}.'
[04.11.2024 14:12] Response: **Prompt:** Create a surrealistic linear art piece on a white background that visually represents the concept of 'Constant Acceleration Flow'. The central image should feature a series of straight trajectories that gradually morph into curvilinear paths, symbolizing the transition from constant velocity to acceleration. Integrate abstract representations of image and noise pairs as intertwining lines, suggesting the coupling process. Include visual elements that depict the idea of learning and adaptation, such as floating gears or clocks, to emphasize the incorporation of learnable variables. Add a whimsical touch with unexpected items like a melting clock or a fish swimming through a geometric landscape to evoke the dreamlike quality of modern art. 

**Label on an object in the image:** "Constant Acceleration Flow: Enhancing Generation Through Dynamic Trajectories"
