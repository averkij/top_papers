[05.11.2024 10:14] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Training-free Regional Prompting for Diffusion Transformers' Text: 'Diffusion models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in text-to-image generation. Their semantic understanding (i.e., prompt following) ability has also been greatly improved with large language models (e.g., T5, Llama). However, existing models cannot perfectly handle long and complex text prompts, especially when the text prompts contain various objects with numerous attributes and interrelated spatial relationships. While many regional prompting methods have been proposed for UNet-based models (SD1.5, SDXL), but there are still no implementations based on the recent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, such as SD3 and FLUX.1.In this report, we propose and implement regional prompting for FLUX.1 based on attention manipulation, which enables DiT with fined-grained compositional text-to-image generation capability in a training-free manner. Code is available at https://github.com/antonioo-c/Regional-Prompting-FLUX.'
[05.11.2024 10:14] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a linear art piece on a white background that visually represents the concept of "Training-free Regional Prompting for Diffusion Transformers." Incorporate abstract representations of a diffusion model, merging shapes and forms that symbolize the transformation of text into images. Use fragmented geometric shapes to illustrate complex text prompts, with various objects interlinked by faint lines that demonstrate their spatial relationships. Integrate elements that suggest large language models, like T5 and Llama, as ethereal silhouettes in the background. Include a flowing text label at the bottom of the image that reads: "Training-free Regional Prompting for Diffusion Transformers."

Title: 'DynaMath: A Dynamic Visual Benchmark for Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning Robustness of Vision Language Models' Text: 'The rapid advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great potential in tackling mathematical reasoning tasks that involve visual context. Unlike humans who can reliably apply solution steps to similar problems with minor modifications, we found that SOTA VLMs like GPT-4o can consistently fail in these scenarios, revealing limitations in their mathematical reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the mathematical reasoning robustness in VLMs and evaluate how well these models perform under different variants of the same question, such as changes in visual numerical values or function graphs. While several vision-based math benchmarks have been developed to assess VLMs' problem-solving capabilities, these benchmarks contain only static sets of problems and cannot easily evaluate mathematical reasoning robustness. To fill this gap, we introduce DynaMath, a dynamic visual math benchmark designed for in-depth assessment of VLMs. DynaMath includes 501 high-quality, multi-topic seed questions, each represented as a Python program. Those programs are carefully designed and annotated to enable the automatic generation of a much larger set of concrete questions, including many different types of visual and textual variations. DynaMath allows us to evaluate the generalization ability of VLMs, by assessing their performance under varying input conditions of a seed question. We evaluated 14 SOTA VLMs with 5,010 generated concrete questions. Our results show that the worst-case model accuracy, defined as the percentage of correctly answered seed questions in all 10 variants, is significantly lower than the average-case accuracy. Our analysis emphasizes the need to study the robustness of VLMs' reasoning abilities, and DynaMath provides valuable insights to guide the development of more reliable models for mathematical reasoning.'
