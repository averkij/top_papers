[01.11.2024 08:17] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'What Happened in LLMs Layers when Trained for Fast vs. Slow Thinking: A Gradient Perspective' Text: 'What makes a difference in the post-training of LLMs? We investigate the training patterns of different layers in large language models (LLMs), through the lens of gradient, when training with different responses and initial models. We are specifically interested in how fast vs. slow thinking affects the layer-wise gradients, given the recent popularity of training LLMs on reasoning paths such as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and process rewards. In our study, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and larger differences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed CoT), indicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Moreover, pre-trained LLMs are less affected by the instability of fast thinking than instruction-tuned LLMs. Additionally, we study whether the gradient patterns can reflect the correctness of responses when training different LLMs using slow vs. fast thinking paths. The results show that the gradients of slow thinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant reasoning paths. As a comparison, we conduct similar gradient analyses on non-reasoning knowledge learning tasks, on which, however, trivially increasing the response length does not lead to similar behaviors of slow thinking. Our study strengthens fundamental understandings of LLM training and sheds novel insights on its efficiency and stability, which pave the way towards building a generalizable System-2 agent. Our code, data, and gradient statistics can be found in: https://github.com/MingLiiii/Layer_Gradient.'
[01.11.2024 08:17] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a linear art piece on a white background that visually represents the concept of "What Happened in LLMs Layers when Trained for Fast vs. Slow Thinking: A Gradient Perspective." Use abstract shapes to symbolize different layers of a neural network, with varying thicknesses and opacities to represent the gradient differences between fast and slow thinking. Incorporate surreal elements, such as clock faces melting or intertwining paths, to illustrate the concept of time and reasoning pathways. Include labeled objects that represent fast thinking (large, chaotic gradients) and slow thinking (stable, organized gradients) through contrasting colors and forms. The title should be displayed as a label on an object within the composition, integrating seamlessly with the overall design.
