[20.10.2024 16:08] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'WorldCuisines: A Massive-Scale Benchmark for Multilingual and Multicultural Visual Question Answering on Global Cuisines' Text: 'Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with culture-specific knowledge, particularly in languages other than English and in underrepresented cultural contexts. To evaluate their understanding of such knowledge, we introduce WorldCuisines, a massive-scale benchmark for multilingual and multicultural, visually grounded language understanding. This benchmark includes a visual question answering (VQA) dataset with text-image pairs across 30 languages and dialects, spanning 9 language families and featuring over 1 million data points, making it the largest multicultural VQA benchmark to date. It includes tasks for identifying dish names and their origins. We provide evaluation datasets in two sizes (12k and 60k instances) alongside a training dataset (1 million instances). Our findings show that while VLMs perform better with correct location context, they struggle with adversarial contexts and predicting specific regional cuisines and languages. To support future research, we release a knowledge base with annotated food entries and images along with the VQA data.'
[20.10.2024 16:08] Response: **Image Prompt**: Create a surreal and modern art piece that visually represents the concept of a global culinary landscape. Imagine a colossal, abstract globe made of various dishes from around the world, each dish morphing into different cultural symbols and languages. Surround the globe with flowing ribbons of text in multiple languages, shimmering with the names of cuisines and their origins. Include whimsical elements such as floating question marks and forks, symbolizing the visual question-answering aspect. In one corner of the image, place a large, ornate frame containing the title: "WorldCuisines: A Massive-Scale Benchmark for Multilingual and Multicultural Visual Question Answering on Global Cuisines" as a label on a pedestal, giving it an air of importance and curiosity. The colors should be vibrant and dreamlike, evoking a sense of wonder about the diversity of global cuisines.

Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'DreamVideo-2: Zero-Shot Subject-Driven Video Customization with Precise Motion Control' Text: 'Recent advances in customized video generation have enabled users to create videos tailored to both specific subjects and motion trajectories. However, existing methods often require complicated test-time fine-tuning and struggle with balancing subject learning and motion control, limiting their real-world applications. In this paper, we present DreamVideo-2, a zero-shot video customization framework capable of generating videos with a specific subject and motion trajectory, guided by a single image and a bounding box sequence, respectively, and without the need for test-time fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce reference attention, which leverages the model's inherent capabilities for subject learning, and devise a mask-guided motion module to achieve precise motion control by fully utilizing the robust motion signal of box masks derived from bounding boxes. While these two components achieve their intended functions, we empirically observe that motion control tends to dominate over subject learning. To address this, we propose two key designs: 1) the masked reference attention, which integrates a blended latent mask modeling scheme into reference attention to enhance subject representations at the desired positions, and 2) a reweighted diffusion loss, which differentiates the contributions of regions inside and outside the bounding boxes to ensure a balance between subject and motion control. Extensive experimental results on a newly curated dataset demonstrate that DreamVideo-2 outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both subject customization and motion control. The dataset, code, and models will be made publicly available.'
[20.10.2024 16:08] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a surrealistic and modern art scene that illustrates the concepts of video customization and motion control. The background is a dreamlike landscape with distorted clocks and floating geometric shapes, symbolizing the fluidity of time and movement. In the foreground, depict a surreal figure holding a large, transparent bounding box, surrounded by vivid, swirling colors that represent customized video content. Integrate visual elements like fragmented images of various subjects (animals, people, objects) that seem to emerge from the bounding box. Use dynamic lines and abstract forms to illustrate precise motion control, creating a sense of movement emanating from the figure’s hands.
