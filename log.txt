[22.10.2024 12:23] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'FrugalNeRF: Fast Convergence for Few-shot Novel View Synthesis without Learned Priors' Text: 'Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) face significant challenges in few-shot scenarios, primarily due to overfitting and long training times for high-fidelity rendering. Existing methods, such as FreeNeRF and SparseNeRF, use frequency regularization or pre-trained priors but struggle with complex scheduling and bias. We introduce FrugalNeRF, a novel few-shot NeRF framework that leverages weight-sharing voxels across multiple scales to efficiently represent scene details. Our key contribution is a cross-scale geometric adaptation scheme that selects pseudo ground truth depth based on reprojection errors across scales. This guides training without relying on externally learned priors, enabling full utilization of the training data. It can also integrate pre-trained priors, enhancing quality without slowing convergence. Experiments on LLFF, DTU, and RealEstate-10K show that FrugalNeRF outperforms other few-shot NeRF methods while significantly reducing training time, making it a practical solution for efficient and accurate 3D scene reconstruction.'
[22.10.2024 12:23] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a linear art illustration on a white background depicting a surreal landscape that represents the concept of "FrugalNeRF". Imagine a scene where abstract, weight-sharing voxels float through a dreamlike space, connected by delicate lines that symbolize the convergence of data and efficiency. Incorporate distorted geometric shapes that represent the complex scheduling and errors faced in few-shot scenarios, blending into the background of a fragmented 3D space that hints at depth perception. In the foreground, include a surreal figure contemplating a depth map, their gaze fixed on the layers of reality being reconstructed around them, illustrating the innovative cross-scale geometric adaptation scheme. 

**Label:** "FrugalNeRF: Fast Convergence for Few-shot Novel View Synthesis without Learned Priors"
