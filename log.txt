[05.11.2024 06:18] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'AndroidLab: Training and Systematic Benchmarking of Android Autonomous Agents' Text: 'Autonomous agents have become increasingly important for interacting with the real world. Android agents, in particular, have been recently a frequently-mentioned interaction method. However, existing studies for training and evaluating Android agents lack systematic research on both open-source and closed-source models. In this work, we propose AndroidLab as a systematic Android agent framework. It includes an operation environment with different modalities, action space, and a reproducible benchmark. It supports both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models (LMMs) in the same action space. AndroidLab benchmark includes predefined Android virtual devices and 138 tasks across nine apps built on these devices. By using the AndroidLab environment, we develop an Android Instruction dataset and train six open-source LLMs and LMMs, lifting the average success rates from 4.59% to 21.50% for LLMs and from 1.93% to 13.28% for LMMs. AndroidLab is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/Android-Lab.'
[05.11.2024 06:18] Response: **Prompt:** Create a surrealistic linear art piece on a white background featuring an abstract representation of an Android autonomous agent interacting with a myriad of virtual environments. The agent should be depicted as a fragmented, humanoid figure composed of geometric shapes and vivid colors, symbolizing both open-source and closed-source models. Surround the figure with floating digital screens displaying various apps and tasks, illustrating the complexity of the AndroidLab framework. Incorporate elements like gears and circuits to represent the operational environment, while abstract shapes depict the action space and modalities. In one corner of the image, include a label with the text: **"AndroidLab: Training and Systematic Benchmarking of Android Autonomous Agents."**

Title: 'WebRL: Training LLM Web Agents via Self-Evolving Online Curriculum Reinforcement Learning' Text: 'Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential as autonomous agents, particularly in web-based tasks. However, existing LLM web agents heavily rely on expensive proprietary LLM APIs, while open LLMs lack the necessary decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces WebRL, a self-evolving online curriculum reinforcement learning framework designed to train high-performance web agents using open LLMs. WebRL addresses three key challenges in building LLM web agents, including the scarcity of training tasks, sparse feedback signals, and policy distribution drift in online learning. Specifically, WebRL incorporates 1) a self-evolving curriculum that generates new tasks from unsuccessful attempts, 2) a robust outcome-supervised reward model (ORM), and 3) adaptive reinforcement learning strategies to ensure consistent improvements. We apply WebRL to transform open Llama-3.1 and GLM-4 models into proficient web agents. On WebArena-Lite, WebRL improves the success rate of Llama-3.1-8B from 4.8% to 42.4%, and from 6.1% to 43% for GLM-4-9B. These open models significantly surpass the performance of GPT-4-Turbo (17.6%) and GPT-4o (13.9%) and outperform previous state-of-the-art web agents trained on open LLMs (AutoWebGLM, 18.2%). Our findings demonstrate WebRL's effectiveness in bridging the gap between open and proprietary LLM-based web agents, paving the way for more accessible and powerful autonomous web interaction systems.'
[05.11.2024 06:18] Response: **Prompt:** Create a surreal linear art piece on a white background, featuring a labyrinthine web structure intertwining with abstract representations of large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents. Depict self-evolving tasks emerging from fragmented elements of failed attempts, symbolizing the dynamic curriculum of WebRL. Integrate visual metaphors for scarcity of training tasks and feedback signals, such as shadowy figures representing lost opportunities. Present adaptive reinforcement learning strategies as colorful tendrils reaching towards a radiant center, illustrating growth and improvement. Include a title label within the artwork that reads: **"WebRL: Training LLM Web Agents via Self-Evolving Online Curriculum Reinforcement Learning."**
