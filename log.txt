[31.10.2024 20:13] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'ReferEverything: Towards Segmenting Everything We Can Speak of in Videos' Text: 'We present REM, a framework for segmenting a wide range of concepts in video that can be described through natural language. Our method capitalizes on visual-language representations learned by video diffusion models on Internet-scale datasets. A key insight of our approach is preserving as much of the generative model's original representation as possible, while fine-tuning it on narrow-domain Referral Object Segmentation datasets. As a result, our framework can accurately segment and track rare and unseen objects, despite being trained on object masks from a limited set of categories. Additionally, it can generalize to non-object dynamic concepts, such as waves crashing in the ocean, as demonstrated in our newly introduced benchmark for Referral Video Process Segmentation (Ref-VPS). Our experiments show that REM performs on par with state-of-the-art approaches on in-domain datasets, like Ref-DAVIS, while outperforming them by up to twelve points in terms of region similarity on out-of-domain data, leveraging the power of Internet-scale pre-training.'
[31.10.2024 20:13] Response: **Prompt:** Create an image in the style of surrealism and modern art featuring a linear representation of a vast ocean scene where dynamic waves are segmented into distinct, colorful objects resembling various everyday items such as clocks, books, and plants, illustrating the concept of segmenting everything we can speak of in videos. In the background, abstract shapes suggest the presence of a video frame, blending into the ocean. Above the scene, include a label in a minimalist font that reads: "ReferEverything: Towards Segmenting Everything We Can Speak of in Videos." The image should have a clean white background to highlight the linear art and vivid colors of the segmented objects.
