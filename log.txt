[04.11.2024 08:17] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'OS-ATLAS: A Foundation Action Model for Generalist GUI Agents' Text: 'Existing efforts in building GUI agents heavily rely on the availability of robust commercial Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o and GeminiProVision. Practitioners are often reluctant to use open-source VLMs due to their significant performance lag compared to their closed-source counterparts, particularly in GUI grounding and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate future research in this area, we developed OS-Atlas - a foundational GUI action model that excels at GUI grounding and OOD agentic tasks through innovations in both data and modeling. We have invested significant engineering effort in developing an open-source toolkit for synthesizing GUI grounding data across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and the web. Leveraging this toolkit, we are releasing the largest open-source cross-platform GUI grounding corpus to date, which contains over 13 million GUI elements. This dataset, combined with innovations in model training, provides a solid foundation for OS-Atlas to understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. Through extensive evaluation across six benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web), OS-Atlas demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation also uncovers valuable insights into continuously improving and scaling the agentic capabilities of open-source VLMs.'
[04.11.2024 08:17] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a linear art composition on a white background depicting a surreal landscape where an abstract representation of OS-Atlas stands as a towering figure, composed of interconnected gears and circuits, embodying the essence of GUI elements. Surround this figure with whimsical clouds shaped like various operating systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and web symbols) drifting in a technicolor sky. Below, a river of flowing code and data streams winds through the scene, symbolizing the depth of the dataset of 13 million GUI elements. Floating above, a large, open book labeled “OS-ATLAS: A Foundation Action Model for Generalist GUI Agents” serves as a label, signifying the foundational knowledge this model represents. The overall mood should juxtapose technological advancement with an imaginative, dream-like quality, creating an engaging and thought-provoking visual experience.
