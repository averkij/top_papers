[22.10.2024 16:15] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Pangea: A Fully Open Multilingual Multimodal LLM for 39 Languages' Text: 'Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their development has predominantly focused on English- and western-centric datasets and tasks, leaving most of the world's languages and diverse cultural contexts underrepresented. This paper introduces Pangea, a multilingual multimodal LLM trained on PangeaIns, a diverse 6M instruction dataset spanning 39 languages. PangeaIns features: 1) high-quality English instructions, 2) carefully machine-translated instructions, and 3) culturally relevant multimodal tasks to ensure cross-cultural coverage. To rigorously assess models' capabilities, we introduce PangeaBench, a holistic evaluation suite encompassing 14 datasets covering 47 languages. Results show that Pangea significantly outperforms existing open-source models in multilingual settings and diverse cultural contexts. Ablation studies further reveal the importance of English data proportions, language popularity, and the number of multimodal training samples on overall performance. We fully open-source our data, code, and trained checkpoints, to facilitate the development of inclusive and robust multilingual MLLMs, promoting equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum.'
[22.10.2024 16:15] Response: **Prompt:** Create a surrealistic linear art image on a white background featuring a large globe made of interconnected language symbols and cultural motifs representing 39 languages. Surround the globe with abstract figures representing diverse people communicating in different languages, each holding a unique object that symbolizes their culture (e.g., a musical instrument, a traditional garment, a book). In the foreground, integrate flowing, ribbon-like text that seamlessly weaves through the scene, highlighting key themes of inclusivity, diversity, and cultural representation. 

**Label on an object in the image:** "Pangea: A Fully Open Multilingual Multimodal LLM for 39 Languages"
