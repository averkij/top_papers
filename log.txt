[01.11.2024 06:07] [Experimental] Generating an image for paper Constraint Back-translation Improves Complex Instruction Following of Large Language Models.
[01.11.2024 06:07] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Constraint Back-translation Improves Complex Instruction Following of Large Language Models' Text: 'Large language models (LLMs) struggle to follow instructions with complex constraints in format, length, etc. Following the conventional instruction-tuning practice, previous works conduct post-training on complex instruction-response pairs generated by feeding complex instructions to advanced LLMs. However, even advanced LLMs cannot follow complex instructions well, thus limiting the quality of generated data. In this work, we find that existing datasets inherently contain implicit complex constraints and propose a novel data generation technique, constraint back-translation. Specifically, we take the high-quality instruction-response pairs in existing datasets and only adopt advanced LLMs to add complex constraints already met by the responses to the instructions, which naturally reduces costs and data noise. In the experiments, we adopt Llama3-70B-Instruct to back-translate constraints and create a high-quality complex instruction-response dataset, named CRAB. We present that post-training on CRAB improves multiple backbone LLMs' complex instruction-following ability, evaluated on extensive instruction-following benchmarks. We further find that constraint back-translation also serves as a useful auxiliary training objective in post-training. Our code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.'
[01.11.2024 06:07] Response: **Prompt:** Create a linear art illustration on a white background that visually represents the themes of 'Constraint Back-translation Improves Complex Instruction Following of Large Language Models.' Imagine a surreal landscape where abstract shapes symbolize complex instructions intertwined with flowing lines and patterns representing constraints. Add elements such as fragmented text blocks and geometric figures to depict the idea of advanced LLMs struggling and evolving through layers of complex information. In the foreground, place an oversized paper label with the title 'Constraint Back-translation Improves Complex Instruction Following of Large Language Models' inscribed in a bold, modern font, serving as a central object of focus in the artwork.
