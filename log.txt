Prompt: Read an abstract of the ML paper and return a JSON with fields: 'desc': explanation of the paper in Russian (4 sentences), use correct machine learning terms. 'emoji': emoji that will reflect the theme of an article somehow, only one emoji. 'title': a slogan of a main idea of the article in Russian. Return only JSON and nothing else.

The Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem offers a powerful framework for
combining optimal transport and diffusion models. A promising recent approach
to solve the SB problem is the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure,
which alternates between Markovian and reciprocal projections of
continuous-time stochastic processes. However, the model built by the IMF
procedure has a long inference time due to using many steps of numerical
solvers for stochastic differential equations.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Discrete-time IMF (D-IMF)
procedure in which learning of stochastic processes is replaced by learning
just a few transition probabilities in discrete time. Its great advantage is
that in practice it can be naturally implemented using the Denoising Diffusion
GAN (DD-GAN), an already well-established adversarial generative modeling
technique. We show that our D-IMF procedure can provide the same quality of
unpaired domain translation as the IMF, using only several generation steps
instead of hundreds. We provide the code at
https://github.com/Daniil-Selikhanovych/ASBM.

  "desc": "В статье предлагается новый метод решения задачи моста Шрёдингера, который сочетает оптимальный транспорт и диффузионные модели. Авторы представляют процедуру дискретно-временного итеративного марковского подбора (D-IMF), которая заменяет обучение стохастических процессов обучением нескольких вероятностей перехода в дискретном времени. Метод реализуется с помощью генеративно-состязательной сети DD-GAN, что позволяет значительно сократить время вывода по сравнению с предыдущими подходами. Авторы демонстрируют, что D-IMF обеспечивает такое же качество неспаренного переноса доменов, как и IMF, но используя всего несколько шагов генерации вместо сотен.",
