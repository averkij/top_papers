Prompt: Read an abstract of the ML paper and return a JSON with fields: 'desc': explanation of the paper in Russian (4 sentences), use correct machine learning terms. 'emoji': emoji that will reflect the theme of an article somehow, only one emoji. 'title': a slogan of a main idea of the article in Russian. Return only JSON and nothing else.

Rapid development of artificial intelligence has drastically accelerated the
development of scientific discovery. Trained with large-scale observation data,
deep neural networks extract the underlying patterns in an end-to-end manner
and assist human researchers with highly-precised predictions in unseen
scenarios. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the empowered
autonomous agents enable scientists to gain help through interaction in
different stages of their research, including but not limited to literature
review, research ideation, idea implementation, and academic writing. However,
AI researchers instantiated by foundation model empowered agents with
full-process autonomy are still in their infancy. In this paper, we study
$\textbf{AI-Generated Science}$ (AIGS), where agents independently and
autonomously complete the entire research process and discover scientific laws.
By revisiting the definition of scientific research, we argue that
$\textit{falsification}$ is the essence of both human research process and the
design of an AIGS system. Through the lens of falsification, prior systems
attempting towards AI-Generated Science either lack the part in their design,
or rely heavily on existing verification engines that narrow the use in
specialized domains. In this work, we propose Baby-AIGS as a baby-step
demonstration of a full-process AIGS system, which is a multi-agent system with
agents in roles representing key research process. By introducing
FalsificationAgent, which identify and then verify possible scientific
discoveries, we empower the system with explicit falsification. Experiments on
three tasks preliminarily show that Baby-AIGS could produce meaningful
scientific discoveries, though not on par with experienced human researchers.
Finally, we discuss on the limitations of current Baby-AIGS, actionable
insights, and related ethical issues in detail.
