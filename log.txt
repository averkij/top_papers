[01.11.2024 10:15] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'A Pointer Network-based Approach for Joint Extraction and Detection of Multi-Label Multi-Class Intents' Text: 'In task-oriented dialogue systems, intent detection is crucial for interpreting user queries and providing appropriate responses. Existing research primarily addresses simple queries with a single intent, lacking effective systems for handling complex queries with multiple intents and extracting different intent spans. Additionally, there is a notable absence of multilingual, multi-intent datasets. This study addresses three critical tasks: extracting multiple intent spans from queries, detecting multiple intents, and developing a multi-lingual multi-label intent dataset. We introduce a novel multi-label multi-class intent detection dataset (MLMCID-dataset) curated from existing benchmark datasets. We also propose a pointer network-based architecture (MLMCID) to extract intent spans and detect multiple intents with coarse and fine-grained labels in the form of sextuplets. Comprehensive analysis demonstrates the superiority of our pointer network-based system over baseline approaches in terms of accuracy and F1-score across various datasets.'
[01.11.2024 10:15] Response: **Prompt:** Create an image featuring a minimalist linear art design on a white background. The central object should be an abstract representation of a pointer network, illustrated as intertwining arrows and lines converging at various points, symbolizing intent detection and extraction. Surrounding this central motif, include fragmented text bubbles emerging from different directions, each containing a unique intent label in varying languages, representing the multilingual aspect of the study. In the bottom corner of the image, add a label that reads: “A Pointer Network-based Approach for Joint Extraction and Detection of Multi-Label Multi-Class Intents.”
