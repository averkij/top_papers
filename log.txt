[31.10.2024 14:12] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'A Large Recurrent Action Model: xLSTM enables Fast Inference for Robotics Tasks' Text: 'In recent years, there has been a trend in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) towards large action models trained offline on large-scale datasets via sequence modeling. Existing models are primarily based on the Transformer architecture, which result in powerful agents. However, due to slow inference times, Transformer-based approaches are impractical for real-time applications, such as robotics. Recently, modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have been proposed that exhibit parallelization benefits during training similar to the Transformer architecture while offering fast inference. In this work, we study the aptitude of these modern recurrent architectures for large action models. Consequently, we propose a Large Recurrent Action Model (LRAM) with an xLSTM at its core that comes with linear-time inference complexity and natural sequence length extrapolation abilities. Experiments on 432 tasks from 6 domains show that LRAM compares favorably to Transformers in terms of performance and speed.'
[31.10.2024 14:12] Response: **Prompt:** Create a linear art piece on a white background that visually represents the concept of a "Large Recurrent Action Model" (LRAM) using abstract shapes and flowing lines to symbolize the dynamic nature of xLSTM and its rapid inference capabilities. Incorporate surreal elements such as clocks melting to signify the speed of inference, gears symbolizing the mechanics of robotics, and a cascading waterfall of data streams flowing from a brain-like structure to illustrate the connection between learning and action. Add a label in elegant, minimalist font at the bottom of the image that reads: "A Large Recurrent Action Model: xLSTM enables Fast Inference for Robotics Tasks."
