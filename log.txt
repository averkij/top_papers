[30.10.2024 07:28] [Experimental] Generating an image for paper CLEAR: Character Unlearning in Textual and Visual Modalities.
[30.10.2024 07:28] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'CLEAR: Character Unlearning in Textual and Visual Modalities' Text: 'Machine Unlearning (MU) is critical for enhancing privacy and security in deep learning models, particularly in large multimodal language models (MLLMs), by removing specific private or hazardous information. While MU has made significant progress in textual and visual modalities, multimodal unlearning (MMU) remains significantly underexplored, partially due to the absence of a suitable open-source benchmark. To address this, we introduce CLEAR, a new benchmark designed to evaluate MMU methods. CLEAR contains 200 fictitious individuals and 3,700 images linked with corresponding question-answer pairs, enabling a thorough evaluation across modalities. We assess 10 MU methods, adapting them for MMU, and highlight new challenges specific to multimodal forgetting. We also demonstrate that simple ell_1 regularization on LoRA weights significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting, preserving model performance on retained data. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/therem/CLEAR'
[30.10.2024 07:28] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a linear art piece on a white background that visually represents the themes of “CLEAR: Character Unlearning in Textual and Visual Modalities.” Include abstract representations of textual and visual modalities, such as books and images, intertwining with symbolic elements of privacy and security, such as locks or shadows. Incorporate the idea of unlearning, perhaps through erasing or fading patterns. The art should convey a sense of complexity and depth, illustrating the concept of multimodal unlearning, with layered elements that suggest both chaos and clarity. 

**Label:** "Machine Unlearning: The Art of Forgetting in Multimodal Landscapes"
