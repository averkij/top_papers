[28.10.2024 16:15] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'FasterCache: Training-Free Video Diffusion Model Acceleration with High Quality' Text: 'In this paper, we present \textit{FasterCache}, a novel training-free strategy designed to accelerate the inference of video diffusion models with high-quality generation. By analyzing existing cache-based methods, we observe that directly reusing adjacent-step features degrades video quality due to the loss of subtle variations. We further perform a pioneering investigation of the acceleration potential of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and reveal significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional features within the same timestep. Capitalizing on these observations, we introduce FasterCache to substantially accelerate diffusion-based video generation. Our key contributions include a dynamic feature reuse strategy that preserves both feature distinction and temporal continuity, and CFG-Cache which optimizes the reuse of conditional and unconditional outputs to further enhance inference speed without compromising video quality. We empirically evaluate FasterCache on recent video diffusion models. Experimental results show that FasterCache can significantly accelerate video generation (\eg 1.67times speedup on Vchitect-2.0) while keeping video quality comparable to the baseline, and consistently outperform existing methods in both inference speed and video quality.'
[28.10.2024 16:15] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a linear art piece on a white background that visually represents the concept of acceleration in video diffusion. Incorporate abstract shapes that symbolize temporal continuity and feature distinction, such as flowing lines and overlapping circles in varying sizes. Use gradients to illustrate the preservation of quality amidst speed, with some shapes appearing more intricate while others are streamlined. Include a surreal element, such as a clock melting or a video reel unraveling into vibrant colors. 

**Label:** "FasterCache: A Dynamic Strategy for Accelerating Video Diffusion while Preserving Quality"
