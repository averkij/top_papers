[01.11.2024 12:22] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Unpacking SDXL Turbo: Interpreting Text-to-Image Models with Sparse Autoencoders' Text: 'Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a core ingredient in the reverse engineering of large-language models (LLMs). For LLMs, they have been shown to decompose intermediate representations that often are not interpretable directly into sparse sums of interpretable features, facilitating better control and subsequent analysis. However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigated the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for a few-step text-to-image diffusion models, such as SDXL Turbo. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net. We find that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. In particular, we find one block that deals mainly with image composition, one that is mainly responsible for adding local details, and one for color, illumination, and style. Therefore, our work is an important first step towards better understanding the internals of generative text-to-image models like SDXL Turbo and showcases the potential of features learned by SAEs for the visual domain.

[01.11.2024 12:23] Response: **Prompt:** A white background features a surreal depiction of a large, abstract, fragmented brain composed of colorful geometric shapes, each representing a different aspect of interpretation and creativity. Interspersed among the shapes are sparse, linear connections resembling neural pathways, leading to three distinct blocks: one shaped like a camera lens symbolizing image composition, another resembling a paintbrush for local details, and the last resembling a lightbulb for color, illumination, and style. Above the brain, a whimsical cloud of text floats, containing phrases like "interpretative features" and "generative processes." The title "Unpacking SDXL Turbo: Interpreting Text-to-Image Models with Sparse Autoencoders" is elegantly inscribed as a label on a pedestal at the foreground, framing the entire composition.
