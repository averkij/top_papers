Title: 'SAM2Long: Enhancing SAM 2 for Long Video Segmentation with a Training-Free Memory Tree' Text: 'The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has emerged as a powerful foundation model for object segmentation in both images and videos, paving the way for various downstream video applications. The crucial design of SAM 2 for video segmentation is its memory module, which prompts object-aware memories from previous frames for current frame prediction. However, its greedy-selection memory design suffers from the "error accumulation" problem, where an errored or missed mask will cascade and influence the segmentation of the subsequent frames, which limits the performance of SAM 2 toward complex long-term videos. To this end, we introduce SAM2Long, an improved training-free video object segmentation strategy, which considers the segmentation uncertainty within each frame and chooses the video-level optimal results from multiple segmentation pathways in a constrained tree search manner. In practice, we maintain a fixed number of segmentation pathways throughout the video. For each frame, multiple masks are proposed based on the existing pathways, creating various candidate branches. We then select the same fixed number of branches with higher cumulative scores as the new pathways for the next frame. After processing the final frame, the pathway with the highest cumulative score is chosen as the final segmentation result. Benefiting from its heuristic search design, SAM2Long is robust toward occlusions and object reappearances, and can effectively segment and track objects for complex long-term videos. Notably, SAM2Long achieves an average improvement of 3.0 points across all 24 head-to-head comparisons, with gains of up to 5.3 points in J&F on long-term video object segmentation benchmarks such as SA-V and LVOS. The code is released at https://github.com/Mark12Ding/SAM2Long.'
[22.10.2024 06:18] Response: **Image Prompt:** Create a surreal linear art piece on a white background that visually represents the concept of a "Memory Tree" in the context of video segmentation. Depict a tree with branches extending outwards, each branch representing a different pathway of video frames, adorned with fragmented masks and abstract shapes that symbolize segmentation uncertainty and error accumulation. Incorporate elements of time, like clock faces or flowing sand, to indicate the progression through frames. In the foreground, illustrate a single, vibrant mask that stands out as the optimal result, surrounded by blurred, abstract forms that hint at occlusions and distractions.
