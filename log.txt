Title: 'MixEval-X: Any-to-Any Evaluations from Real-World Data Mixtures' Text: 'Perceiving and generating diverse modalities are crucial for AI models to effectively learn from and engage with real-world signals, necessitating reliable evaluations for their development. We identify two major issues in current evaluations: (1) inconsistent standards, shaped by different communities with varying protocols and maturity levels; and (2) significant query, grading, and generalization biases. To address these, we introduce MixEval-X, the first any-to-any real-world benchmark designed to optimize and standardize evaluations across input and output modalities. We propose multi-modal benchmark mixture and adaptation-rectification pipelines to reconstruct real-world task distributions, ensuring evaluations generalize effectively to real-world use cases. Extensive meta-evaluations show our approach effectively aligns benchmark samples with real-world task distributions and the model rankings correlate strongly with that of crowd-sourced real-world evaluations (up to 0.98). We provide comprehensive leaderboards to rerank existing models and organizations and offer insights to enhance understanding of multi-modal evaluations and inform future research.'
[18.10.2024 15:04] Generating image by prompt: **Prompt:** Create a surreal landscape where dappled light filters through a forest of abstract shapes that represent diverse modalities—colors and forms blending seamlessly like brush strokes of modern art. In the foreground, a grand, multi-layered sculpture, resembling a mix of a chaotic cityscape and organic forms, embodies the concept of "MixEval-X"—an intricate blend of realities, showcasing the fusion of technology and the natural world. Floating in the sky are giant, ethereal canvases illustrating inconsistent evaluation standards, swirling in patterns of confusion and clarity, while shadowy figures engage in a spectral dance of grading biases. In the background, a spectral staircase spirals upward, symbolizing the journey towards reliable evaluations and adaptation-rectification, leading into an infinite horizon where the boundaries between inputs and outputs dissolve, inviting the viewer to reflect on the essence of real-world task distributions..
