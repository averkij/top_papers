[19.10.2024 06:15] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'Janus: Decoupling Visual Encoding for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation' Text: 'In this paper, we introduce Janus, an autoregressive framework that unifies multimodal understanding and generation. Prior research often relies on a single visual encoder for both tasks, such as Chameleon. However, due to the differing levels of information granularity required by multimodal understanding and generation, this approach can lead to suboptimal performance, particularly in multimodal understanding. To address this issue, we decouple visual encoding into separate pathways, while still leveraging a single, unified transformer architecture for processing. The decoupling not only alleviates the conflict between the visual encoder's roles in understanding and generation, but also enhances the framework's flexibility. For instance, both the multimodal understanding and generation components can independently select their most suitable encoding methods. Experiments show that Janus surpasses previous unified model and matches or exceeds the performance of task-specific models. The simplicity, high flexibility, and effectiveness of Janus make it a strong candidate for next-generation unified multimodal models.'
[19.10.2024 06:15] Generating image by prompt: **Image Prompt:** Create a surrealistic landscape where two distinct pathways—one representing multimodal understanding and the other representing multimodal generation—intertwine yet diverge within a fantastical environment. Visual elements should include an abstract, shimmering transformer architecture that looms over the landscape, evoking a sense of high-tech sophistication. Incorporate elements like fragmented mirrors and chameleons that symbolize the duality and adaptability of visual encoding. The color palette should blend vibrant hues with muted tones, reflecting the idea of unity amidst diversity.

**Text Label:** "Janus: Decoupling Visual Encoding for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation.".
