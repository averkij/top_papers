GUIs have long been central to human-computer interaction, providing an
intuitive and visually-driven way to access and interact with digital systems.
The advent of LLMs, particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of
GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural
language understanding, code generation, and visual processing. This has paved
the way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting
complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural
language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users
to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands.
Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and
desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that
revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is
rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.
  To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a
comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical
evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research
questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization
of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action
models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks
necessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging
applications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey
identifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in
the field. By consolidating foundational knowledge and state-of-the-art
developments, this work aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in
overcoming challenges and unlocking the full potential of LLM-brained GUI
agents.

Language model post-training is applied to refine behaviors and unlock new
skills across a wide range of recent language models, but open recipes for
applying these techniques lag behind proprietary ones. The underlying training
data and recipes for post-training are simultaneously the most important pieces
of the puzzle and the portion with the least transparency. To bridge this gap,
we introduce T\"ULU 3, a family of fully-open state-of-the-art post-trained
models, alongside its data, code, and training recipes, serving as a
comprehensive guide for modern post-training techniques. T\"ULU 3, which builds
on Llama 3.1 base models, achieves results surpassing the instruct versions of
Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral, and even closed models such as GPT-4o-mini and
Claude 3.5-Haiku. The training algorithms for our models include supervised
finetuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a novel method we
call Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). With T\"ULU 3, we
introduce a multi-task evaluation scheme for post-training recipes with
development and unseen evaluations, standard benchmark implementations, and
substantial decontamination of existing open datasets on said benchmarks. We
conclude with analysis and discussion of training methods that did not reliably
improve performance.
  In addition to the T\"ULU 3 model weights and demo, we release the complete
recipe -- including datasets for diverse core skills, a robust toolkit for data
curation and evaluation, the training code and infrastructure, and, most
importantly, a detailed report for reproducing and further adapting the T\"ULU
3 approach to more domains.

skills across a wide range of recent language models, but open recipes for
applying these techniques lag behind proprietary ones. The underlying training
data and recipes for post-training are simultaneously the most important pieces
of the puzzle and the portion with the least transparency. To bridge this gap,
we introduce T\"ULU 3, a family of fully-open state-of-the-art post-trained
models, alongside its data, code, and training recipes, serving as a
comprehensive guide for modern post-training techniques. T\"ULU 3, which builds
on Llama 3.1 base models, achieves results surpassing the instruct versions of
Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral, and even closed models such as GPT-4o-mini and
Claude 3.5-Haiku. The training algorithms for our models include supervised
finetuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a novel method we
call Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). With T\"ULU 3, we
introduce a multi-task evaluation scheme for post-training recipes with
development and unseen evaluations, standard benchmark implementations, and
substantial decontamination of existing open datasets on said benchmarks. We
conclude with analysis and discussion of training methods that did not reliably
improve performance.
  In addition to the T\"ULU 3 model weights and demo, we release the complete
recipe -- including datasets for diverse core skills, a robust toolkit for data
curation and evaluation, the training code and infrastructure, and, most
importantly, a detailed report for reproducing and further adapting the T\"ULU
3 approach to more domains."

The promise of human behavioral simulation--general-purpose computational
agents that replicate human behavior across domains--could enable broad
applications in policymaking and social science. We present a novel agent
architecture that simulates the attitudes and behaviors of 1,052 real
individuals--applying large language models to qualitative interviews about
their lives, then measuring how well these agents replicate the attitudes and
behaviors of the individuals that they represent. The generative agents
replicate participants' responses on the General Social Survey 85% as
accurately as participants replicate their own answers two weeks later, and
perform comparably in predicting personality traits and outcomes in
experimental replications. Our architecture reduces accuracy biases across
racial and ideological groups compared to agents given demographic
descriptions. This work provides a foundation for new tools that can help

Accurate and consistent evaluation is crucial for decision-making across
numerous fields, yet it remains a challenging task due to inherent
subjectivity, variability, and scale. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of
"LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With
their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable,
cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling
alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the
reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that
requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a
comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can
reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance
reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting
to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for
evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel
benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world
deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications,
challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational
reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.

This paper presents a critical examination of current approaches to
replicating OpenAI's O1 model capabilities, with particular focus on the
widespread but often undisclosed use of knowledge distillation techniques.
While our previous work explored the fundamental technical path to O1
replication, this study reveals how simple distillation from O1's API, combined
with supervised fine-tuning, can achieve superior performance on complex
mathematical reasoning tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show that a
base model fine-tuned on simply tens of thousands of samples O1-distilled
long-thought chains outperforms O1-preview on the American Invitational
Mathematics Examination (AIME) with minimal technical complexity. Moreover, our
investigation extends beyond mathematical reasoning to explore the
generalization capabilities of O1-distilled models across diverse tasks:
hallucination, safety and open-domain QA. Notably, despite training only on
mathematical problem-solving data, our models demonstrated strong
generalization to open-ended QA tasks and became significantly less susceptible
to sycophancy after fine-tuning. We deliberately make this finding public to
promote transparency in AI research and to challenge the current trend of
obscured technical claims in the field. Our work includes: (1) A detailed
technical exposition of the distillation process and its effectiveness, (2) A
comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and categorizing O1
replication attempts based on their technical transparency and reproducibility,
(3) A critical discussion of the limitations and potential risks of
over-relying on distillation approaches, our analysis culminates in a crucial
bitter lesson: while the pursuit of more capable AI systems is important, the
development of researchers grounded in first-principles thinking is paramount.

"This paper presents a critical examination of current approaches to
replicating OpenAI's O1 model capabilities, with particular focus on the
widespread but often undisclosed use of knowledge distillation techniques.
While our previous work explored the fundamental technical path to O1
replication, this study reveals how simple distillation from O1's API, combined
with supervised fine-tuning, can achieve superior performance on complex
mathematical reasoning tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show that a
base model fine-tuned on simply tens of thousands of samples O1-distilled
long-thought chains outperforms O1-preview on the American Invitational
Mathematics Examination (AIME) with minimal technical complexity. Moreover, our
investigation extends beyond mathematical reasoning to explore the
generalization capabilities of O1-distilled models across diverse tasks:
hallucination, safety and open-domain QA. Notably, despite training only on
mathematical problem-solving data, our models demonstrated strong
generalization to open-ended QA tasks and became significantly less susceptible
to sycophancy after fine-tuning. We deliberately make this finding public to
promote transparency in AI research and to challenge the current trend of
obscured technical claims in the field. Our work includes: (1) A detailed
technical exposition of the distillation process and its effectiveness, (2) A
comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and categorizing O1
replication attempts based on their technical transparency and reproducibility,
(3) A critical discussion of the limitations and potential risks of
over-relying on distillation approaches, our analysis culminates in a crucial
bitter lesson: while the pursuit of more capable AI systems is important, the
development of researchers grounded in first-principles thinking is paramount."
