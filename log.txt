The Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem offers a powerful framework for
combining optimal transport and diffusion models. A promising recent approach
to solve the SB problem is the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure,
which alternates between Markovian and reciprocal projections of
continuous-time stochastic processes. However, the model built by the IMF
procedure has a long inference time due to using many steps of numerical
solvers for stochastic differential equations.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Discrete-time IMF (D-IMF)
procedure in which learning of stochastic processes is replaced by learning
just a few transition probabilities in discrete time. Its great advantage is
that in practice it can be naturally implemented using the Denoising Diffusion
GAN (DD-GAN), an already well-established adversarial generative modeling
technique. We show that our D-IMF procedure can provide the same quality of
unpaired domain translation as the IMF, using only several generation steps
instead of hundreds. We provide the code at
