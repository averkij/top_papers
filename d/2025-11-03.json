            "abstract": "Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this, we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods, while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by 13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.",

            "abstract": "We present Denario, an AI multi-agent system designed to serve as a scientific research assistant. Denario can perform many different tasks, such as generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans, writing and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a scientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle specific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end scientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we describe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by presenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical informatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine, neuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we discuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such technology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code at https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario. A Denario demo can also be run directly on the web at https://huggingface.co/spaces/astropilot-ai/Denario, and the full app will be deployed on the cloud.",
