## Project Overview

This project uses Python scripts to:

1. **Scrape Hugging Face Papers**: We extract papers published on Hugging Face, including titles, abstracts, and other key details.
2. **Generate Summaries via LLM API**: Abstracts are summarized using a large language model (Anthropic's Claude), generating brief, descriptive Russian summaries, tags, emojis, and catchy titles for each paper.
3. **Publish Reviews**: The summaries are transformed into a visually appealing HTML page and shared as a JSON feed. The HTML page is also available for easy browsing of the papers and their reviews.

The project automates the entire process, ensuring you get a curated overview of the latest Hugging Face papers every day.

## Features

- **Daily Reviews**: Automatically generated reviews of the most recent papers, including a short summary, tags, and related emoji.
- **Catchy Visuals**: Each paper comes with a catchy title and emoji that reflect the theme of the paper.
- **HTML Page with Dark and Light Themes**: Browse the latest reviews in an HTML page with an interactive light/dark theme toggle.
- **GitHub Actions Deployment**: The entire workflow is automated using GitHub Actions, ensuring the latest reviews are generated and deployed regularly.

## How It Works

- The script scrapes the **[Hugging Face Papers](https://huggingface.co/papers)** page daily.
- It extracts key information, such as title, abstract, and score of each paper.
- For each paper, the summary, tags, and other details are generated using **Anthropic's Claude** API.
- The generated information is saved in a JSON feed and presented on an HTML page.
- The deployment is automated using **GitHub Actions**, which runs every 2 hours to generate new reviews and deploy them to the website.

## GitHub Actions Deployment

The project is deployed automatically using GitHub Actions with the following workflow:

- **Workflow Name**: Issue Doomgrad Paper Review
- **Trigger**: The workflow runs every 2 hours (`cron: "0 */2 * * *"`) and can also be triggered manually.
- **Jobs**:
  - **Checkout Repository Content**: The repository content is checked out using `actions/checkout@v2`.
  - **Set Up Python**: Python 3.9 is set up using `actions/setup-python@v2`.
  - **Install Dependencies**: Required dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - **Run Python Script**: The `main.py` script is executed to generate the reviews.
  - **Commit Changes**: The changes are committed with a timestamped message.
  - **Push Changes**: The changes are pushed back to the GitHub repository.

This automation ensures that the reviews are always up-to-date and available for the audience without manual intervention.

The generated HTML page is deployed at [HFday.ru](https://hfday.ru), allowing users to browse the reviews easily.

## Usage

1. **Run the Python script** to generate the latest reviews:
   ```sh
   python generate_reviews.py
   ```
2. **HTML Page**: The reviews are saved in `index.html`, which can be opened in any browser for a beautiful reading experience.
3. **Log Files**: Logs are kept in `log.txt` and archived periodically for tracking purposes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- **BeautifulSoup** for HTML parsing.
- **Anthropic API Key** to generate summaries.
- **Babel** for date formatting.

Install the required packages using:
```sh
pip install beautifulsoup4 babel anthropic tqdm
```
