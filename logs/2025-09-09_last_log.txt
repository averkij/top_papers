This study examines the role of guided decoding in RAG systems, comparing three methods, Outlines, XGrammar, and LM Format Enforcer, across different multi-turn prompting setups (0-turn, 1-turn, and 2-turn). By evaluating success rates, hallucination rates, and output quality, we provide insights into their performance and applicability. Our findings reveal how multi-turn interactions influence guided decoding, uncovering unexpected performance variations that can inform method selection for specific use cases. This work advances the understanding of structured output generation in RAG systems, offering both theoretical insights and practical guidance for LLM deployment.

Our implementation will be available at https://github.com/JokerJohn/DCReg. Keywords LiDAR Degeneracy, Point Cloud Registration, Ill-conditioning, LiDAR SLAMLiDAR-based perception forms the foundation of modern autonomous systems, from self-driving vehicles to industrial robots. At its core, point cloud registration, enables these systems to build spatial understanding through applications in motion estimation Wu et al. (2022); Xue et al. (2025), mapping Ye et al. (2019); Qin et al. (2020); Shan et al. (2020); Hu et al. (2024a), localization ?Hu et al. (2024b), calibration Jiao et al. (2021b); Wu et al. (2019, 2021), and scene reconstruction Huang et al. (2021). Despite its fundamental importance, LiDAR registration remains inherently vulnerable to failure in geometrically degenerate environments such as corridors, tunnels, and open fields, where repetitive patterns or sparse features predominate. These challenging scenarios inherently lack sufficient geometric constraints along specific motion directions, resulting in rank-deficient or near-singular information matrices Nashed et al. (2021) that render the optimization problem ill-conditioned. This numerical ill-conditioning makes the solution highly sensitive to sensor noise and initial estimates, which manifests as amplified error propagation and unstable solutions, ultimately leading to catastrophic failures in autonomous navigation. Consequently, even minor perturbations in sensor measurements or initial estimates can Prepared using sagej.cls [Version: 2017/01/17 v1.20] induce catastrophic divergence in the solution, precipitating complete navigation failure. The ability to understand and resolve such ill-conditioning is thus not merely technical optimization but prerequisite for deploying reliable autonomous systems for real-world applications. Current approaches Tuna et al. (2023, 2025); Zhang et al. (2016) typically adopt detect-then-mitigate paradigm, yet they fail to address the fundamental questions: when, why, and how does registration become ill-conditioned? This failure stems from three interconnected challenges: When to detect: Existing detection methods Hinduja et al. (2024b); Tuna et al. (2023); Zhang and Singh (2014) analyze the the (2019); Hu et al. 1Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China 2Department of Mechanical Engineering at National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan 3School of Intelligent Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China 4University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies and the University of Toronto Robotics Institute, Toronto, Canada Corresponding author: Jin Wu, Full Professor, School of Intelligent Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China Email: wujin@ustb.edu.cn 2 The International Journal of Robotics Research 00(0) Hessian spectral in optimization, where inherent scale disparity and coupling effects between translation and rotation mask critical ill-conditioning patterns. This coupling causes rotational degeneracy to be masked by translational eigenvalues, leading to missed detections or over-detections in precisely those scenarios where robots are most vulnerable. Why it fails: Even when ill-conditioning is detected, current methods Hu et al. (2024b); Hinduja et al. (2019) cannot explain which physical motions are degenerate and characterize to what extent they are degenerate. The mathematical abstractions (eigenvectors) remain ambiguous from the physical reality of robot motion, leaving practitioners without actionable insights for navigation decisions or system design improvements. How to mitigate: Existing mitigation strategies, whether regularization Golub et al. (1999); Tuna et al. (2025), truncation Hansen (1990), or remapping Zhang and Singh (2014); Zhang et al. (2016), apply blanket corrections that fundamentally alter the optimization problem. They either inject artificial constraints where none exist or discard valid information, inadvertently corrupting well-constrained directions while attempting to stabilize ill-conditioned ones. These fundamental limitations motivate us to r"

Guided decoding methods in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are evaluated for structured output generation, revealing performance variations across different prompting setups.  					AI-generated summary 				 The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications has driven the need for structured and reliable responses. A key challenge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is ensuring that outputs align with expected formats while minimizing hallucinations. This study examines the role of guided decoding in RAG systems, comparing three methods, Outlines, XGrammar, and LM Format Enforcer, across different multi-turn prompting setups (0-turn, 1-turn, and 2-turn). By evaluating success rates, hallucination rates, and output quality, we provide insights into their performance and applicability. Our findings reveal how multi-turn interactions influence guided decoding, uncovering unexpected performance variations that can inform method selection for specific use cases. This work advances the understanding of structured output generation in RAG systems, offering both theoretical insights and practical guidance for LLM deployment.

DCReg addresses ill-conditioned LiDAR point cloud registration by detecting, characterizing, and mitigating degeneracies through Schur complement decomposition and a novel preconditioner.  					AI-generated summary 				 LiDAR point cloud registration is fundamental to robotic perception and navigation. However, in geometrically degenerate or narrow environments, registration problems become ill-conditioned, leading to unstable solutions and degraded accuracy. While existing approaches attempt to handle these issues, they fail to address the core challenge: accurately detection, interpret, and resolve this ill-conditioning, leading to missed detections or corrupted solutions. In this study, we introduce DCReg, a principled framework that systematically addresses the ill-conditioned registration problems through three integrated innovations. First, DCReg achieves reliable ill-conditioning detection by employing a Schur complement decomposition to the hessian matrix. This technique decouples the registration problem into clean rotational and translational subspaces, eliminating coupling effects that mask degeneracy patterns in conventional analyses. Second, within these cleanly subspaces, we develop quantitative characterization techniques that establish explicit mappings between mathematical eigenspaces and physical motion directions, providing actionable insights about which specific motions lack constraints. Finally, leveraging this clean subspace, we design a targeted mitigation strategy: a novel preconditioner that selectively stabilizes only the identified ill-conditioned directions while preserving all well-constrained information in observable space. This enables efficient and robust optimization via the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method with a single physical interpretable parameter. Extensive experiments demonstrate DCReg achieves at least 20% - 50% improvement in localization accuracy and 5-100 times speedup over state-of-the-art methods across diverse environments. Our implementation will be available at https://github.com/JokerJohn/DCReg.

"DCReg addresses ill-conditioned LiDAR point cloud registration by detecting, characterizing, and mitigating degeneracies through Schur complement decomposition and a novel preconditioner.  					AI-generated summary 				 LiDAR point cloud registration is fundamental to robotic perception and navigation. However, in geometrically degenerate or narrow environments, registration problems become ill-conditioned, leading to unstable solutions and degraded accuracy. While existing approaches attempt to handle these issues, they fail to address the core challenge: accurately detection, interpret, and resolve this ill-conditioning, leading to missed detections or corrupted solutions. In this study, we introduce DCReg, a principled framework that systematically addresses the ill-conditioned registration problems through three integrated innovations. First, DCReg achieves reliable ill-conditioning detection by employing a Schur complement decomposition to the hessian matrix. This technique decouples the registration problem into clean rotational and translational subspaces, eliminating coupling effects that mask degeneracy patterns in conventional analyses. Second, within these cleanly subspaces, we develop quantitative characterization techniques that establish explicit mappings between mathematical eigenspaces and physical motion directions, providing actionable insights about which specific motions lack constraints. Finally, leveraging this clean subspace, we design a targeted mitigation strategy: a novel preconditioner that selectively stabilizes only the identified ill-conditioned directions while preserving all well-constrained information in observable space. This enables efficient and robust optimization via the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method with a single physical interpretable parameter. Extensive experiments demonstrate DCReg achieves at least 20% - 50% improvement in localization accuracy and 5-100 times speedup over state-of-the-art methods across diverse environments. Our implementation will be available at https://github.com/JokerJohn/DCReg."

Inpaint4Drag enhances drag-based image editing by decomposing it into pixel-space warping and inpainting, offering real-time performance and superior visual quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at 512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification, automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/inpaint4drag/
