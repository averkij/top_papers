This enables efficient and robust optimization via the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method with single physical interpretable parameter. Extensive experiments demonstrate DCReg achieves at least 20% - 50% improvement in localization accuracy and 5-100 times speedup over state-of-the-art methods across diverse environments. Our implementation will be available at https://github.com/JokerJohn/DCReg. Keywords LiDAR Degeneracy, Point Cloud Registration, Ill-conditioning, LiDAR SLAMLiDAR-based perception forms the foundation of modern autonomous systems, from self-driving vehicles to industrial robots. At its core, point cloud registration, enables these systems to build spatial understanding through applications in motion estimation Wu et al. (2022); Xue et al. (2025), mapping Ye et al. (2019); Qin et al. (2020); Shan et al. (2020); Hu et al. (2024a), localization ?Hu et al. (2024b), calibration Jiao et al. (2021b); Wu et al. (2019, 2021), and scene reconstruction Huang et al. (2021). Despite its fundamental importance, LiDAR registration remains inherently vulnerable to failure in geometrically degenerate environments such as corridors, tunnels, and open fields, where repetitive patterns or sparse features predominate. These challenging scenarios inherently lack sufficient geometric constraints along specific motion directions, resulting in rank-deficient or near-singular information matrices Nashed et al. (2021) that render the optimization problem ill-conditioned. This numerical ill-conditioning makes the solution highly sensitive to sensor noise and initial estimates, which manifests as amplified error propagation and unstable solutions, ultimately leading to catastrophic failures in autonomous navigation. Consequently, even minor perturbations in sensor measurements or initial estimates can Prepared using sagej.cls [Version: 2017/01/17 v1.20] induce catastrophic divergence in the solution, precipitating complete navigation failure. The ability to understand and resolve such ill-conditioning is thus not merely technical optimization but prerequisite for deploying reliable autonomous systems for real-world applications. Current approaches Tuna et al. (2023, 2025); Zhang et al. (2016) typically adopt detect-then-mitigate paradigm, yet they fail to address the fundamental questions: when, why, and how does registration become ill-conditioned? This failure stems from three interconnected challenges: When to detect: Existing detection methods Hinduja et al. (2024b); Tuna et al. (2023); Zhang and Singh (2014) analyze the the (2019); Hu et al. 1Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China 2Department of Mechanical Engineering at National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan 3School of Intelligent Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China 4University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies and the University of Toronto Robotics Institute, Toronto, Canada Corresponding author: Jin Wu, Full Professor, School of Intelligent Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China Email: wujin@ustb.edu.cn 2 The International Journal of Robotics Research 00(0) Hessian spectral in optimization, where inherent scale disparity and coupling effects between translation and rotation mask critical ill-conditioning patterns. This coupling causes rotational degeneracy to be masked by translational eigenvalues, leading to missed detections or over-detections in precisely those scenarios where robots are most vulnerable. Why it fails: Even when ill-conditioning is detected, current methods Hu et al. (2024b); Hinduja et al. (2019) cannot explain which physical motions are degenerate and characterize to what extent they are degenerate. The mathematical abstractions (eigenvectors) remain ambiguous from the physical reality of robot motion, leaving practitioners without actionable insights for navigation decisions or system design improvements. How to mitigate: Existing mitigation strategies, whether regularization Golub et al. (1999); Tuna et al. (2025), truncation Hansen (1990), or remapping Zhang and Singh (2014); Zhang et al. (2016), apply blanket corrections that fundamentally alter the optimization problem. They either inject artificial constraints where none exist or discard valid information, inadvertently corrupting well-constrained directions while attempting to stabilize ill-conditioned ones. These fundamental limitations motivate us to r"

Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model, and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we present CLIP-SVD, a novel multi-modal and parameter-efficient adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced adaptation performance using only 0.04\% of the model's total parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10 biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

Multi-task learning (MTL) is often achieved by merging datasets before fine-tuning, but the growing availability of fine-tuned models has led to new approaches such as model merging via task arithmetic. A major challenge in this setting is task interference, which worsens as the number of tasks increases. We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance. Unlike existing methods, our approach remains robust as the number of tasks grows and consistently outperforms prior work.

  "desc": "Статья представляет новый метод объединения моделей, обученных на разных задачах, в единую модель. Авторы используют дивергенцию Йенсена-Шеннона для управления процессом слияния без необходимости в дополнительных размеченных данных. Метод автоматически балансирует важность задач и остается эффективным при увеличении их количества. Предложенный подход превосходит существующие методы и решает проблему интерференции задач в мультизадачном обучении.",

"Multi-task learning (MTL) is often achieved by merging datasets before fine-tuning, but the growing availability of fine-tuned models has led to new approaches such as model merging via task arithmetic. A major challenge in this setting is task interference, which worsens as the number of tasks increases. We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance. Unlike existing methods, our approach remains robust as the number of tasks grows and consistently outperforms prior work."
