Text:"Zetong Zhou1, Dongping Chen1,3, Zixian Ma2, Zhihan Hu1, Mingyang Fu1, Sinan Wang1, Yao Wan1, Zhou Zhao4, and Ranjay Krishna2 1ONE Lab, HUST, 2University of Washington, 3University of Maryland, 4Zhejiang University Visual reasoning, cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems. While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReV PT to enhance multi-modal LLMs abilities to reason about and use visual tools through reinforcement learning. We introduce novel RL algorithm based on GRPO, designed to train models to reason with suite of four visual tools. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench, BLINK and MMStar, outperforming the supervised and text-based RL finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReV PT-3B and ReV PT-7B outperform the instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive ablations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ls-kelvin/REVPT. 1. Introduction Visual reasoning is core component of human intelligence. It enables us to solve wide range of problems, from daily activities such as navigation to challenging geometry problems. Unlike verbal reasoning, visual reasoning is more complex multifaceted process that requires not just straightforward logical reasoning but also sound visual perception, which further relies on atomic abilities such as object recognition, edge 5 2 0 S 1 ] .

Equipped with diffusion-based value model that enhances training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing TraceRL, we derive series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models, namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks. TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1% relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical applications, we release comprehensive open-source framework for building, training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and general tasks.

Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks. TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1% relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building, training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and general tasks.

UniVerse-1, a unified audio-video generation model, uses a stitching of experts technique to combine pre-trained video and music models, ensuring accurate temporal alignment and producing high-quality audio-visual outputs.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations. Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.
