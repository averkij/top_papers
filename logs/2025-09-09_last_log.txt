[ 1 8 2 3 0 0 . 9 0 5 2 : r Mechanistic Interpretability for Steering Vision-Language-Action Models Bear Haon Kaylene Stocking Ian Chuang Claire Tomlin Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences University of California, Berkeley Figure 1: We present framework for steering Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. We extract FFN vectors, project them to the VLA token space, cluster them by semantic alignment, and inject activations at inference time to modulate behavior. Our experiments demonstrate interpretable zero-shot control in both simulation (OPENVLA in LIBERO) and on physical robot (π0 on UR5). Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are promising path to realizing generalist embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and environments. However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these findings, we introduce generalpurpose activation steering method that modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source VLAs, π0 and OPENVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in simulation (LIBERO) and on physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that interpretable"

A framework for interpreting and steering Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models via internal representations enables real-time behavioral control without fine-tuning or environment interaction.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a promising path to realizing generalist embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and environments. However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation models in robotics.
