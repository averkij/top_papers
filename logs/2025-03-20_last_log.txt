We are developing foundation model for 3D intelligence that will Figure 1 support applications like scene generation. This winter village scene was generated through multi-turn conversation with our prototype scene generation tool. 1See Appendix for the full author list. Figure 2 Overview. We present an important step towards the foundation model for 3D intelligence. Specifically, our report focuses on 3D shape tokenizationa technique for converting between shapes and discrete tokens. We also demonstrate how our tokenization scheme enables multiple applications including text-to-shape generation, shape-to-text generation, and text-to-scene generation. 1. Introduction Modern generative AI promises to give every human collaborative assistant for creating visual content. An assistant that can convert simple inputs, such as text prompts, into productionquality visual experiences. Today, these assistants typically rely on an underlying foundation AI model that is trained on vast amounts of broad, multi-modal data, and then fine-tuned to perform specific downstream assistive tasks (Bommasani et al., 2021). Recent foundation models that bridge the domains of text, image, audio and video have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generation capabilities (Achiam et al., 2023; Team et al., 2024). At Roblox, our goal is to build foundation model for 3D intelligence. We envision this model as the base for variety of collaborative assistants that will aid developers in producing all aspects of Roblox experiences from creating individual 3D objects (e.g., make motorbike with wings), to full 3D scene layout (e.g., create futuristic cloud city), to rigged character avatars (e.g., generate an alien ninja capable of doing wall jumps) to scripts describing object behaviors, interactions and game logic (e.g., make the door open when player is near it and carrying gold key). We believe that building such foundation model for 3D reasoning and generation imposes three core design requirements. Learn jointly from sparse, multi-modal data. The amount of readily available 3D experience data suitable for training is much less than the data available for training text, image or video models. But 3D data is multi-modal (e.g., geometric meshes, CSG parts, layouts, textures, rigging, programmed scripts) and the modalities are strongly correlated with each other (e.g., an objects texture and placement in scene often strongly correlate with its shape). Thus, our model should jointly learn from all the modalities available in the training data. Handle unbounded input/output size via an autoregressive model. 3D experiences can be of vastly different sizes, such as micro-scene containing few static objects (e.g., room with dinner table and chairs) to multi-apartment building with interactive doors and elevators, to large-scale city with interacting vehicles and non-player characters. To handle inputs and outputs at each of these scales, our model should be autoregressive Figure 3 Shape Tokenization. Our pipeline encodes an input mesh into discrete tokens through several steps: (1) We sample points from the mesh surface and embed them using our Phased-Modulated Positional Encoding; (2) Perceiver-based transformer (Jaegle et al., 2021) encodes these points into continuous latent vectors, regularized with self-supervised loss; (3) We apply optimal-transport vector quantization (Zhang et al., 2024) to convert these vectors into discrete shape tokens; (4) These tokens can later be decoded into an occupancy field for mesh extraction. To improve training stability and the reconstruction quality, we also introduce Stochastic Gradient Shortcut layer that allows the decoder to utilize the continuous latent vectors directly during training. with large context length. Collaborate with humans and other AI systems via multi-modal inputs/outputs. Humans are familiar with data modalities such as natural language text, images, sketches and video and should be able to express design intents using any of them. Moreover, existing large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o (Achiam et al., 2023), which are trained with vast amounts of multi-modal data including text, programs, images, vector graphics, scene graphs, video, speech, audio, etc. can provide common sense knowledge (i.e., general priors) on variety of topics. Thus, for our model to seamlessly collaborate with humans as well as other LLMs, multi-modal data should be first-class input and output data types. In this report we present our first step towards this foundational model for 3D intelligence. Specifically, we focus on discrete tokenization of the 3D shape, recognizing that geometry will be central data type of our foundation model. We show how our tokenization scheme can be used to build several applications including text-to-shape generation, shape-to-text generation, and text-to-scene generation (Figures 1 and 2). We also demonstrate how these applications can collaborate with text-based LLM to perform scene analysis and reasoning tasks.

Despite the recent success of image-text contrastive models like CLIP and SigLIP, these models often struggle with vision-centric tasks that demand high-fidelity image understanding, such as counting, depth estimation, and fine-grained object recognition. These models, by performing language alignment, tend to prioritize high-level semantics over visual understanding, weakening their image understanding. On the other hand, vision-focused models are great at processing visual information but struggle to understand language, limiting their flexibility for language-driven tasks. In this work, we introduce TULIP, an open-source, drop-in replacement for existing CLIP-like models. Our method leverages generative data augmentation, enhanced image-image and text-text contrastive learning, and image/text reconstruction regularization to learn fine-grained visual features while preserving global semantic alignment. Our approach, scaling to over 1B parameters, outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple benchmarks, establishing a new SOTA zero-shot performance on ImageNet-1K, delivering up to a 2times enhancement over SigLIP on RxRx1 in linear probing for few-shot classification, and improving vision-language models, achieving over 3times higher scores than SigLIP on MMVP.

"Foundation models trained on vast amounts of data have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generation capabilities in the domains of text, images, audio and video. Our goal at Roblox is to build such a foundation model for 3D intelligence, a model that can support developers in producing all aspects of a Roblox experience, from generating 3D objects and scenes to rigging characters for animation to producing programmatic scripts describing object behaviors. We discuss three key design requirements for such a 3D foundation model and then present our first step towards building such a model. We expect that 3D geometric shapes will be a core data type and describe our solution for 3D shape tokenizer. We show how our tokenization scheme can be used in applications for text-to-shape generation, shape-to-text generation and text-to-scene generation. We demonstrate how these applications can collaborate with existing large language models (LLMs) to perform scene analysis and reasoning. We conclude with a discussion outlining our path to building a fully unified foundation model for 3D intelligence."

Recent advances in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) are primarily focused on offline video understanding. Instead, streaming video understanding poses great challenges to recent models due to its time-sensitive, omni-modal and interactive characteristics. In this work, we aim to extend the streaming video understanding from a new perspective and propose a novel task named Visual Instruction Feedback in which models should be aware of visual contents and learn to extract instructions from them. For example, when users wave their hands to agents, agents should recognize the gesture and start conversations with welcome information. Thus, following instructions in visual modality greatly enhances user-agent interactions. To facilitate research, we define seven key subtasks highly relevant to visual modality and collect the ViSpeak-Instruct dataset for training and the ViSpeak-Bench for evaluation. Further, we propose the ViSpeak model, which is a SOTA streaming video understanding LMM with GPT-4o-level performance on various streaming video understanding benchmarks. After finetuning on our ViSpeak-Instruct dataset, ViSpeak is equipped with basic visual instruction feedback ability, serving as a solid baseline for future research.

Developing AI agents to autonomously manipulate graphical user interfaces is a long challenging task. Recent advances in data scaling law inspire us to train computer-use agents with a scaled instruction set, yet using behavior cloning to train agents still requires immense high-quality trajectories. To meet the scalability need, we designed STEVE, a step verification pipeline for computer-use agent training. First, we establish a large instruction set for computer-use agents and collect trajectory data with some suboptimal agents. GPT-4o is used to verify the correctness of each step in the trajectories based on the screens before and after the action execution, assigning each step with a binary label. Last, we adopt the Kahneman and Tversky Optimization to optimize the agent from the binary stepwise labels. Extensive experiments manifest that our agent outperforms supervised finetuning by leveraging both positive and negative actions within a trajectory. Also, STEVE enables us to train a 7B vision-language model as a computer-use agent, achieving leading performance in the challenging live desktop environment WinAgentArena with great efficiency at a reduced cost.
