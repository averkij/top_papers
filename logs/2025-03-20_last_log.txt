Text:"MusicInfuser: Making Video Diffusion Listen and DanceIra Kemelmacher-ShlizermanSteven M. Seitz5 2 0 2 8 1 ] . [ 1 5 0 5 4 1 . 3 0 5 2 : r Figure 1. MusicInfuser adapts video diffusion models to music, making them listen and dance according to the music. This adaptation is done in prior-preserving manner, enabling it to also accept style through the prompt while aligning the movement to the music. Please refer to the project page videos, as the movement appears slower due to the frame sampling rate.We introduce MusicInfuser, an approach for generating high-quality dance videos that are synchronized to specified music track. Rather than attempting to design and train new multimodal audio-video model, we show how existing video diffusion models can be adapted to align with musical inputs by introducing lightweight music-video cross-attention and low-rank adapter. Unlike prior work requiring motion capture data, our approach fine-tunes only on dance videos. MusicInfuser achieves high-quality music-driven video generation while preserving the flexi1 bility and generative capabilities of the underlying models. We introduce an evaluation framework using Video-LLMs to assess multiple dimensions of dance generation quality. The project page and code are available at https: //susunghong.github.io/MusicInfuser. 1. Introduction Todays leading AI video generation tools (e.g., Sora, Gen, Veo) produce silent videos. While its possible to add music after the fact, it is difficult to generate motion thats properly synchronized with specified music track. Some research has begun to explore joint audio-video generation, e.g., [39], but this area is in its infancy and requires training larger and more complex joint audio-video models. In this paper, we introduce an approach to adapt pretrained text-to-video models to condition on music tracks. Our method, called MusicInfuser, generates output videos that are synchronized with the input music, with styles and appearances controllable via text prompts. We focus on the specific application of dance, i.e., generating realistic dancing figures that adjust and synchronize to the music. The automatic generation of dance movements from music presents significant challenges due to the need to simultaneously consider multiple aspects such as style, beat, and the inherently multimodal nature of dance, where multiple valid movement sequences can follow from any given pose [30]. Principles of choreography [48] have inspired computational approaches to dance generation, leading researchers to explore methods ranging from graph-based approaches [12, 28] to modern deep neural networks [45, 50, 51] to synthesize dance movements. However, traditional methods for dance synthesis have relied on motion capture data [2], which is resource-intensive, or reconstructed motions [32], which often have floating and jitter issues [2]. We take different approach by aligning music with videos generated by pre-trained Text-to-Video (T2V) models [44]. MusicInfuser does not require motion capture or motion reconstruction, but instead simply uses dance videos for training. Concretely, we propose adapter networks consisting of music-video cross-attention and lowrank adapter, along with novel training methodology and layer selection strategy for the cross-attention to maintain balanced representation between multiple modalities with significant modality gaps. Besides endowing the video diffusion model with the ability to listen to music, MusicInfuser preserves the rich knowledge in the text modality, enabling various forms of control and providing flexible interface for the generation process. This means users can still leverage textual prompts to guide dance style, setting, and other aesthetic elements while maintaining synchronization with music  (Fig. 1)  . Moreover, our framework can even generalize to make group choreography  (Fig. 2)  and longer dance videos with unseen music tracks  (Fig. 3)  . To systematically evaluate our results, we developed an automatic evaluation framework using Video-LLMs [31] capable of processing video, audio, and language information simultaneously. This comprehensive approach allows us to assess multiple dimensions of dance quality, video quality, and prompt alignment within single framework. Our experiments demonstrate that MusicInfuser effectively bridges the gap between music and videos without requiring specialized motion data. By leveraging existing video diffusion models through targeted adaptation, we achieve high-quality and novel dance movements that respond naturally to musical rhythms and patterns, offering versatility in response to prompts and suggesting another direction for music-driven choreography synthesis. 2. Related Work Music-to-Dance Generation Early music-to-dance generation research developed frameworks mapping music primitives to dance elements, using Hidden Markov Models [35]. Graph-based methods built movement transition graphs synchronized to musical beats [28], using quality rating functions and constraint-based dynamic programming [15]. Later, researchers incorporated Gaussian processes [16], Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Recurrent Neural Networks [1], and Convolutional Neural Networks [50, 51]. More recent approaches incorporate transformers [32, 50]. For instance, Full-Attention Cross-Modal Transformer [32] predicts dance sequences based on seed motion and audio information. Traditional approaches typically generated movements synchronized with beats but lacking contextual meaning or showing excessive repetition [3], while showing limited choreographic diversity [4] and struggling with generalization. Recent dance generation advances have shifted toward diffusionbased approaches to address limitations of earlier methods [2, 29, 36, 37, 45]. Unlike these approaches that focus on motion skeleton synthesis from music, MusicInfuser directly synthesizes dance videos and choreography by uniquely adapting pre-trained text-to-video diffusion models to incorporate musical inputs while preserving their inherent knowledge of diverse dance styles and general human movements. Controllable Approaches Dance generation systems have evolved to incorporate multiple input modalities for richer choreographic control [8, 18, 34], with text emerging as powerful interface for its zero-shot capability and communicating choreographic ideas [34]. Transformerbased approaches using Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoders create d"

Temporal quality is a critical aspect of video generation, as it ensures consistent motion and realistic dynamics across frames. However, achieving high temporal coherence and diversity remains challenging. In this work, we explore temporal augmentation in video generation for the first time, and introduce FluxFlow for initial investigation, a strategy designed to enhance temporal quality. Operating at the data level, FluxFlow applies controlled temporal perturbations without requiring architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and VBench benchmarks demonstrate that FluxFlow significantly improves temporal coherence and diversity across various video generation models, including U-Net, DiT, and AR-based architectures, while preserving spatial fidelity. These findings highlight the potential of temporal augmentation as a simple yet effective approach to advancing video generation quality.

Paper text to classify:

"We introduce MusicInfuser, an approach for generating high-quality dance videos that are synchronized to a specified music track. Rather than attempting to design and train a new multimodal audio-video model, we show how existing video diffusion models can be adapted to align with musical inputs by introducing lightweight music-video cross-attention and a low-rank adapter. Unlike prior work requiring motion capture data, our approach fine-tunes only on dance videos. MusicInfuser achieves high-quality music-driven video generation while preserving the flexibility and generative capabilities of the underlying models. We introduce an evaluation framework using Video-LLMs to assess multiple dimensions of dance generation quality. The project page and code are available at https://susunghong.github.io/MusicInfuser."
