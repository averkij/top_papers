Text:"LLM-FE: Automated Feature Engineering for Tabular Data with LLMs as Evolutionary Optimizers Nikhil Abhyankar 1 Parshin Shojaee 1 Chandan K. Reddy 1 5 2 0 2 8 1 ] . [ 1 4 3 4 4 1 . 3 0 5 2 : r aAutomated feature engineering plays critical role in improving predictive model performance for tabular learning tasks. Traditional automated feature engineering methods are limited by their reliance on pre-defined transformations within fixed, manually designed search spaces, often neglecting domain knowledge. Recent advances using Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the integration of domain knowledge into the feature engineering process. However, existing LLM-based approaches use direct prompting or rely solely on validation scores for feature selection, failing to leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments or establish meaningful reasoning between feature generation and datadriven performance. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-FE, novel framework that combines evolutionary search with the domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automatically discover effective features for tabular learning tasks. LLM-FE formulates feature engineering as program search problem, where LLMs propose new feature transformation programs iteratively, and data-driven feedback guides the search process. Our results demonstrate that LLM-FE consistently outperforms state-of-theart baselines, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular prediction models across diverse classification and regression benchmarks.1 1. Introduction Feature engineering, the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features for machine learning models, is crucial for improving predictive performance, particularly 1Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech. Contact: Nikhil Abhyankar <nikhilsa@vt.edu>, Parshin Shojaee <parshinshojaee@vt.edu>. 1The code and data are available at: https://github. com/nikhilsab/LLMFE when working with tabular data (Domingos, 2012). In many tabular prediction tasks, well-designed features have been shown to significantly enhance the performance of treebased models, often outperforming deep learning models that rely on learned representations (Grinsztajn et al., 2022). However, data-centric tasks such as feature engineering are one of the most challenging processes in the tabular learning workflow (Anaconda, 2020; Hollmann et al., 2024), as they require experts and data scientists to explore many possible combinations in the vast combinatorial space of feature transformations. Classical feature engineering methods (Kanter & Veeramachaneni, 2015; Khurana et al., 2016; 2018; Horn et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2023) construct extensive search spaces of feature processing operations, relying on various search and optimization techniques to identify the most effective features. However, these search spaces are mostly constrained by predefined, manually designed transformations and often fail to incorporate domain knowledge (Zhang et al., 2023). Domain knowledge can serve as an invaluable prior for identifying these transformations, leading to reduced complexity and more interpretable and effective features (Hollmann et al., 2024). Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful solution to this challenge, offering access to extensive embedded domain knowledge that can be leveraged for feature engineering. While recent approaches have demonstrated promising results in incorporating this knowledge into automated feature discovery, current LLM-based methods (Hollmann et al., 2024; Han et al., 2024) rely predominantly on direct prompting mechanisms or validation scores to guide the feature generation process. These approaches do not leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments, thereby falling short of establishing meaningful reasoning between feature generation and datadriven performance. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-FE, novel framework integrating the capabilities of LLMs with tabular prediction models and evolutionary search to facilitate effective feature optimization. As shown in Figure 1, LLM-FE follows an iterative process to generate and evaluate the hypothesis of the feature transformation, using the performance of the tabular prediction model as reward LLM-FE: Automated Feature Engineering for Tabular Data with LLMs as Evolutionary Optimizers Figure 1. Overview of the LLM-FE Framework. For given dataset, LLM-FE follows these steps: (a) New Hypothesis Generation, where an LLM generates feature transformation hypotheses as programs for given tabular dataset; (b) Feature Engineering, where the feature transformation program is applied to the underlying dataset, resulting in modified dataset; (c) Model Fitting, where prediction model is fitted on the modified training set and evaluated on the corresponding validation set; (d) Multi-Population Memory, which maintains buffer of high-scoring programs that act as in-context samples for LLMs iterative refinement prompt. to enhance the generation of effective features. Starting from an initial feature transformation program, LLM-FE leverages the LLMs embedded domain knowledge by incorporating task-specific details, feature descriptions, and subset of data samples to generate new feature discovery hypotheses (Figure 1(a)). At each iteration, LLM acts as knowledge-guided evolutionary optimizer, which mutates examples of previously successful feature transformation programs to generate new effective features (Meyerson et al., 2024). The refined hypotheses are then evaluated by augmenting the original dataset with the proposed feature hypotheses (Figure 1(b)) and training tabular prediction model on the augmented data (Figure 1(c)). The models performance, measured on held-out validation set, provides data-driven feedback that, combined with dynamic memory of previously explored feature transformation programs (Figure 1(d)), guides the LLM to refine its hypothesis generation iteratively. Table 1 summarizes list of distinguishing features of LLM-FE compared to the state-of-the-art classical and LLM-based feature engineering methods. Unlike prior methods that rely on either fixed rules or pure LLM generation, LLM-FE leverages LLMs domain knowledge to seed flexible hypothesis space while employing evolutionary optimization to iteratively refine features. This facilitates openended feature discovery, generalizing effectively across both classification and regression tas"

Text:"SWEET-RL: Training Multi-Turn LLM Agents on Collaborative Reasoning Tasks Yifei Zhou1,2,, Song Jiang1, Yuandong Tian1, Jason Weston1, Sergey Levine2, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar1,, Xian Li1, 1FAIR at Meta, 2UC Berkeley Work done at Meta, Equal advising Large language model (LLM) agents need to perform multi-turn interactions in real-world tasks. However, existing multi-turn RL algorithms for optimizing LLM agents fail to perform effective credit assignment over multiple turns while leveraging the generalization capabilities of LLMs and it remains unclear how to develop such algorithms. To study this, we first introduce new benchmark, ColBench, where an LLM agent interacts with human collaborator over multiple turns to solve realistic tasks in backend programming and frontend design. Building on this benchmark, we propose novel RL algorithm, SWEET-RL (RL with Step-WisE Evaluation from Training-time information), that uses carefully designed optimization objective to train critic model with access to additional training-time information. The critic provides step-level rewards for improving the policy model. Our experiments demonstrate that SWEET-RL achieves 6% absolute improvement in success and win rates on ColBench compared to other state-of-the-art multi-turn RL algorithms, enabling Llama-3.1-8B to match or exceed the performance of GPT4-o in realistic collaborative content creation.

Recent advancements in LLM pretraining have featured ever-expanding context windows to process longer sequences. However, our pilot study reveals that models pretrained with shorter context windows consistently outperform their long-context counterparts under a fixed token budget. This finding motivates us to explore an optimal context window scheduling strategy to better balance long-context capability with pretraining efficiency. To this end, we propose SkyLadder, a simple yet effective approach that implements a short-to-long context window transition. SkyLadder preserves strong standard benchmark performance, while matching or exceeding baseline results on long context tasks. Through extensive experiments, we pre-train 1B-parameter models (up to 32K context) and 3B-parameter models (8K context) on 100B tokens, demonstrating that SkyLadder yields consistent gains of up to 3.7% on common benchmarks, while achieving up to 22% faster training speeds compared to baselines.

Automated feature engineering plays a critical role in improving predictive model performance for tabular learning tasks. Traditional automated feature engineering methods are limited by their reliance on pre-defined transformations within fixed, manually designed search spaces, often neglecting domain knowledge. Recent advances using Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the integration of domain knowledge into the feature engineering process. However, existing LLM-based approaches use direct prompting or rely solely on validation scores for feature selection, failing to leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments or establish meaningful reasoning between feature generation and data-driven performance. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-FE, a novel framework that combines evolutionary search with the domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automatically discover effective features for tabular learning tasks. LLM-FE formulates feature engineering as a program search problem, where LLMs propose new feature transformation programs iteratively, and data-driven feedback guides the search process. Our results demonstrate that LLM-FE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular prediction models across diverse classification and regression benchmarks.

"Automated feature engineering plays a critical role in improving predictive model performance for tabular learning tasks. Traditional automated feature engineering methods are limited by their reliance on pre-defined transformations within fixed, manually designed search spaces, often neglecting domain knowledge. Recent advances using Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the integration of domain knowledge into the feature engineering process. However, existing LLM-based approaches use direct prompting or rely solely on validation scores for feature selection, failing to leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments or establish meaningful reasoning between feature generation and data-driven performance. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-FE, a novel framework that combines evolutionary search with the domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automatically discover effective features for tabular learning tasks. LLM-FE formulates feature engineering as a program search problem, where LLMs propose new feature transformation programs iteratively, and data-driven feedback guides the search process. Our results demonstrate that LLM-FE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular prediction models across diverse classification and regression benchmarks."

Large language model (LLM) agents need to perform multi-turn interactions in real-world tasks. However, existing multi-turn RL algorithms for optimizing LLM agents fail to perform effective credit assignment over multiple turns while leveraging the generalization capabilities of LLMs and it remains unclear how to develop such algorithms. To study this, we first introduce a new benchmark, ColBench, where an LLM agent interacts with a human collaborator over multiple turns to solve realistic tasks in backend programming and frontend design. Building on this benchmark, we propose a novel RL algorithm, SWEET-RL (RL with Step-WisE Evaluation from Training-time information), that uses a carefully designed optimization objective to train a critic model with access to additional training-time information. The critic provides step-level rewards for improving the policy model. Our experiments demonstrate that SWEET-RL achieves a 6% absolute improvement in success and win rates on ColBench compared to other state-of-the-art multi-turn RL algorithms, enabling Llama-3.1-8B to match or exceed the performance of GPT4-o in realistic collaborative content creation.
