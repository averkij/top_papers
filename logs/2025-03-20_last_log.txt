[ 1 4 8 2 0 1 . 3 0 5 2 : r Journal of Machine Learning Research 23 (2025) 1-6 Submitted ; Revised ; Published PyGDA: Python Library for Graph Domain Adaptation Zhen Zhang1 Meihan Liu2 Bingsheng He1 1National University of Singapore, Singapore 2Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China Editor: My editor zhen@nus.edu.sg lmh zju@zju.edu.cn hebs@comp.nus.edu.sg Abstract Graph domain adaptation has emerged as promising approach to facilitate knowledge transfer across different domains. Recently, numerous models have been proposed to enhance their generalization capabilities in this field. However, there is still no unified library that brings together existing techniques and simplifies their implementation. To fill this gap, we introduce PyGDA, an open-source Python library tailored for graph domain adaptation. As the first comprehensive library in this area, PyGDA covers more than 20 widely used graph domain adaptation methods together with different types of graph datasets. Specifically, PyGDA offers modular components, enabling users to seamlessly build custom models with variety of commonly used utility functions. To handle large-scale graphs, PyGDA includes support for features such as sampling and minibatch processing, ensuring efficient computation. In addition, PyGDA also includes comprehensive performance benchmarks and well-documented user-friendly API for both researchers and practitioners. To foster convenient accessibility, PyGDA is released under the MIT license at https://github.com/pygda-team/pygda, and the API documentation is https://pygda.readthedocs.io/en/stable/. Keywords: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation, Graph Neural Networks, Unsupervised Learning, Node/Graph Classification Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in various graph learning tasks, such node classification, and social recommendation (Kipf and Welling, 2016; Zhang et al., 2018; Fan et al., 2019), etc. Nevertheless, their performance heavily depends on "

Graph domain adaptation has emerged as a promising approach to facilitate knowledge transfer across different domains. Recently, numerous models have been proposed to enhance their generalization capabilities in this field. However, there is still no unified library that brings together existing techniques and simplifies their implementation. To fill this gap, we introduce PyGDA, an open-source Python library tailored for graph domain adaptation. As the first comprehensive library in this area, PyGDA covers more than 20 widely used graph domain adaptation methods together with different types of graph datasets. Specifically, PyGDA offers modular components, enabling users to seamlessly build custom models with a variety of commonly used utility functions. To handle large-scale graphs, PyGDA includes support for features such as sampling and mini-batch processing, ensuring efficient computation. In addition, PyGDA also includes comprehensive performance benchmarks and well-documented user-friendly API for both researchers and practitioners.
