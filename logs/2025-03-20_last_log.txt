[ 1 0 6 3 3 1 . 3 0 5 2 : r Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated enhanced reasoning capabilities, evolving from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to advanced, product-oriented solutions like OpenAI o1. During our reimplementation of this model, we noticed that in multimodal tasks requiring visual input (e.g., geometry problems), Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) struggle to maintain focus on the visual information, in other words, MLLMs suffer from gradual decline in attention to visual information as reasoning progresses, causing text-over-relied outputs. To investigate this, we ablate image inputs during long-chain reasoning. Concretely, we truncate the reasoning process midway, then re-complete the reasoning process with the input image removed. We observe only 2% accuracy drop on MathVistas test-hard subset, revealing the models textual outputs dominate the following reasoning process. Motivated by this, we propose Take-along Visual Conditioning (TVC), strategy that shifts image input to critical reasoning stages and compresses redundant visual tokens via dynamic pruning. This methodology helps the model retain attention to the visual components throughout the reasoning. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks (+3.4% vs previous sota), demonstrating the effectiveness of TVC in enhancing multimodal reasoning systems. The project page is available at https://sun-hailong.github.io/ projects/TVC. 1School of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University 2National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University 3Tencent. Correspondence to: Han-Jia Ye <yehj@lamda.nju.edu.cn>. 1 Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in the area of reasoning. These models have evolved from simple prompt-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) techniques to sophisticated product-oriented solutions like OpenAIs o1 (OpenAI, 2024b), DeepSeekR1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024), and Qwen-QVQ (QwenTeam, 2024), demonstrating iterative reasoning capabilities for complex multi-step tasks, which enables them to handle tasks that require multi-step thinking, logic, and knowledge integration. Recently, several works also extended the CoT reasoning process to MLLMs settings through data-centric innovations. For instance, Math-LLaVA (Shi et al., 2024) pioneers domain-specific training with the MathV360K dataset, while MAmmoTH-VL (Guo et al., 2024) scales up multimodal CoT data generation. While such progress is notable in text-based domains, extending these advancements to multimodal scenarios presents unique challenges that transcend traditional language model boundaries. Reasoning in MLLMs requires fused understanding across different modalities, for example, in geometric reasoning tasks the model should interpret and reason about images alongside text. Therefore, the models ability to integrate and maintain focus on both types of information is critical. Unlike text-only LLMs that reinforce problem context through linguistic recurrence, MLLMs struggle to sustain visual attention across reasoning steps. That is, as the length of the context increases, the model is more inclined to conduct the next step of reasoning based on the previously outputted text rather than the information of the image itself, which eventually leads to the continuation of the wrong text reasoning process and degraded model performance. We term this phenomenon as visual forgetting. In this work, we conduct diagnostic analysis of the visual forgetting effect within long-chain reasoning system. The system processes multimodal Q&A tasks through series of interconnected reasoning steps. We demonstrate significantly reduced attentional allocation to visual inputs during multi-stage reasoning processes. More formally, our analysis: 1) truncates the reasoning process midway and removes Mitigating Visual Forgetting via Take-along Visual Conditioning for Multi-modal Long CoT Reasoning the image embeddings; 2) regenerates subsequent reasoning trajectories; 3) evaluates the reasoning outcomes of the pre/post-ablation inference trajectories. Intuitively, the performance gap between normal reasoning and diagnostic reasoning reveals the models dependency on generated text over original visual evidence. Our results (See Section 2.1) on the MathVista-Hard datasets show that, removing the image midway through the reasoning only causes an insignificant performance degradation (i.e.2%), indicating that the model completes the reasoning process based primarily on its output text. More importantly, we also observe that the models dependency on the visual evidence diminishes over time since the early removal of the image inputs could hurt accuracy by 20%. This suggests models reasoning employs both visual and textual information in the early stage, then over-relying on text history which limits full visual reasoning potential. Motivated by this, we propose novel strategy to mitigate the visual forgetting effect and maintain visual attention throughout the reasoning process. Our methodology compresses and shifts the image input to the later stages of the reasoning process, ensuring the model integrates sufficient visual evidence into its reasoning. This approach results in improved performance and achieves state-of-the-art results on average across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks (i.e., +3.4% vs previous sota). Our findings highlight the effectiveness of this strategy in enhancing the performance of multimodal reasoning systems, providing robust solution to the problem of visual forgetting in long-chain reasoning tasks. 2. Take-along Visual Conditioning: Sustaining Visual Evidence for Multi-modal Long CoT Reasoning In this section, we first discuss our motivation and observations of the visual forgetting phenomenon in MLLM reasoning systems (Section 2.1). Then, we propose the Take-alone Visual Conditioning (TVC) approach to mitigate visual forgetting and enhance the models long-chain reasoning capabilities (Section 2.2). 2.1. Capturing the Visual Forgetting Text-based reasoning systems often repeat key terms or phrases (e.g., restating triangle ABC or equation (1)) to keep the problems context c"

"Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated enhanced reasoning capabilities, evolving from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to advanced, product-oriented solutions like OpenAI o1. During our re-implementation of this model, we noticed that in multimodal tasks requiring visual input (e.g., geometry problems), Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) struggle to maintain focus on the visual information, in other words, MLLMs suffer from a gradual decline in attention to visual information as reasoning progresses, causing text-over-relied outputs. To investigate this, we ablate image inputs during long-chain reasoning. Concretely, we truncate the reasoning process midway, then re-complete the reasoning process with the input image removed. We observe only a ~2% accuracy drop on MathVista's test-hard subset, revealing the model's textual outputs dominate the following reasoning process. Motivated by this, we propose Take-along Visual Conditioning (TVC), a strategy that shifts image input to critical reasoning stages and compresses redundant visual tokens via dynamic pruning. This methodology helps the model retain attention to the visual components throughout the reasoning. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks (+3.4% vs previous sota), demonstrating the effectiveness of TVC in enhancing multimodal reasoning systems."
