[ 1 4 4 1 4 0 . 2 1 4 2 : r Abstract Model merging has shown great promise at combining expert models, but the benefit of merging is unclear when merging generalist models trained on many tasks. We explore merging in the context of large ( 100B) models, by recycling checkpoints that exhibit tradeoffs among different tasks. Such checkpoints are often created in the process of developing frontier model, and many suboptimal ones are usually discarded. Given pool of model checkpoints obtained from different training runs (e.g., different stages, objectives, hyperparameters, and data mixtures), which naturally show tradeoffs across different language capabilities (e.g., instruction following vs. code generation), we investigate whether merging can recycle such suboptimal models into Pareto-optimal one. Our optimization algorithm tunes the weight of each checkpoint in linear combination, resulting in Pareto-optimal models that outperforms both individual models and merge-based baselines. Further analysis shows that good merges tend to include almost all checkpoints with with non-zero weights, indicating that even seemingly bad initial checkpoints can contribute to good final merges. 1. Introduction Model merging is gaining traction as cost-effective alternative to multi-task learning or model ensembling (Wortsman et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2024). While the research on model merging has rapidly advanced in the last few years, it remains limited in terms of both model scale and the type of considered checkpoints. On one hand, most work has studied merging fairly small models (e.g., 7B) by todays standards, and it remains unclear how much benefit merging would bring with much larger models (e.g., 100B+).
