Text:"4 2 0 2 4 ] . [ 1 3 2 1 3 0 . 2 1 4 2 : r ROBUST MULTI-BIT TEXT WATERMARK WITH LLM-BASED PARAPHRASERS Xiaojun Xu1, Jinghan Jia2*, Yuanshun Yao1, Yang Liu3*, and Hang Li {xiaojun.xu,kevin.yao,lihang.lh}@bytedance.com jiajingh@msu.edu, yangliu@ucsc.edu 1ByteDance Research 2Michigan State University 3University of California, Santa Cruz *Work done while at ByteDance Research. We propose an imperceptible multi-bit text watermark embedded by paraphrasing with LLMs. We fine-tune pair of LLM paraphrasers that are designed to behave differently so that their paraphrasing difference reflected in the text semantics can be identified by trained decoder. To embed our multi-bit watermark, we use two paraphrasers alternatively to encode the pre-defined binary code at the sentence level. Then we use text classifier as the decoder to decode each bit of the watermark. Through extensive experiments, we show that our watermarks can achieve over 99.99% detection AUC with small (1.1B) text paraphrasers while keeping the semantic information of the original sentence. More importantly, our pipeline is robust under word substitution and sentence paraphrasing perturbations and generalizes well to out-of-distributional data. We also show the stealthiness of our watermark with LLM-based evaluation. We opensource the code: https://github.com/xiaojunxu/multi-bit-text-watermark. Text watermark aims to encode some imperceptible signal into piece of text so that people are able to decode the signal from the text (Liu et al., 2024). It can be useful in various applications such as copyright protection and hidden message communication. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is also growing need to track misinformation spread by LLMs using text watermark injected to model outputs (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023). We study the methodology of injecting multi-bit watermark message into piece of text by paraphrasing. The watermarked text will keep the semantic meaning of the original text"
