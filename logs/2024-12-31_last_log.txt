We present PERSE, a method for building an animatable personalized generative avatar from a reference portrait. Our avatar model enables facial attribute editing in a continuous and disentangled latent space to control each facial attribute, while preserving the individual's identity. To achieve this, our method begins by synthesizing large-scale synthetic 2D video datasets, where each video contains consistent changes in the facial expression and viewpoint, combined with a variation in a specific facial attribute from the original input. We propose a novel pipeline to produce high-quality, photorealistic 2D videos with facial attribute editing. Leveraging this synthetic attribute dataset, we present a personalized avatar creation method based on the 3D Gaussian Splatting, learning a continuous and disentangled latent space for intuitive facial attribute manipulation. To enforce smooth transitions in this latent space, we introduce a latent space regularization technique by using interpolated 2D faces as supervision. Compared to previous approaches, we demonstrate that PERSE generates high-quality avatars with interpolated attributes while preserving identity of reference person.

"We present PERSE, a method for building an animatable personalized generative avatar from a reference portrait. Our avatar model enables facial attribute editing in a continuous and disentangled latent space to control each facial attribute, while preserving the individual's identity. To achieve this, our method begins by synthesizing large-scale synthetic 2D video datasets, where each video contains consistent changes in the facial expression and viewpoint, combined with a variation in a specific facial attribute from the original input. We propose a novel pipeline to produce high-quality, photorealistic 2D videos with facial attribute editing. Leveraging this synthetic attribute dataset, we present a personalized avatar creation method based on the 3D Gaussian Splatting, learning a continuous and disentangled latent space for intuitive facial attribute manipulation. To enforce smooth transitions in this latent space, we introduce a latent space regularization technique by using interpolated 2D faces as supervision. Compared to previous approaches, we demonstrate that PERSE generates high-quality avatars with interpolated attributes while preserving identity of reference person."

The remarkable performance of models like the OpenAI o1 can be attributed to their ability to emulate human-like long-time thinking during inference. These models employ extended chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, exploring multiple strategies to enhance problem-solving capabilities. However, a critical question remains: How to intelligently and efficiently scale computational resources during testing. This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the prevalent issue of overthinking in these models, where excessive computational resources are allocated for simple problems with minimal benefit. We introduce novel efficiency metrics from both outcome and process perspectives to evaluate the rational use of computational resources by o1-like models. Using a self-training paradigm, we propose strategies to mitigate overthinking, streamlining reasoning processes without compromising accuracy. Experimental results show that our approach successfully reduces computational overhead while preserving model performance across a range of testsets with varying difficulty levels, such as GSM8K, MATH500, GPQA, and AIME.

Recently, "visual o1" began to enter people's vision, with expectations that this slow-thinking design can solve visual reasoning tasks, especially geometric math problems. However, the reality is that current LVLMs (Large Vision Language Models) can hardly even accurately copy a geometric figure, let alone truly understand the complex inherent logic and spatial relationships within geometric shapes. We believe accurate copying (strong perception) is the first step to visual o1. Accordingly, we introduce the concept of "slow perception" (SP), which guides the model to gradually perceive basic point-line combinations, as our humans, reconstruct complex geometric structures progressively. There are two-fold stages in SP: a) perception decomposition. Perception is not instantaneous. In this stage, complex geometric figures are broken down into basic simple units to unify geometry representation. b) perception flow, which acknowledges that accurately tracing a line is not an easy task. This stage aims to avoid "long visual jumps" in regressing line segments by using a proposed "perceptual ruler" to trace each line stroke-by-stroke. Surprisingly, such a human-like perception manner enjoys an inference time scaling law -- the slower, the better. Researchers strive to speed up the model's perception in the past, but we slow it down again, allowing the model to read the image step-by-step and carefully.
