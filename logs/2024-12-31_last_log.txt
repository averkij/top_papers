SWE-Gym contains 2,438 real-world Python task instances, each comprising codebase with an executable runtime environment, unit tests, and task specified in natural language. We use SWE-Gym to train language model based SWE agents, achieving up to 19% absolute gains in resolve rate on the popular SWE-Bench Verified and Lite test sets. We also experiment with inference-time scaling through verifiers trained on agent trajectories sampled from SWE-Gym. When combined with our fine-tuned SWE agents, we achieve 32.0% and 26.0% on SWE-Bench Verified and Lite, respectively, reflecting new stateof-the-art for open-weight SWE agents. To facilitate further research, we publicly release SWEGym, models, and agent trajectories.1 1. Introduction Language models (LMs) have remarkable promise in automating software engineering (SWE) tasks, as most clearly measured by recent progress on recent benchmarks like SWE-Bench (Jimenez et al., 2024) and Commit0 (Zhao et al., 2024). While LM-based SWE agents have shown significant performance gains through improving agentcomputer interfaces (Yang et al., 2024) and prompting strategies (Wang et al., 2024c), advances in SWE agents have been limited by reliance on proprietary models, rather than improving underlying LM itself. Unlike other domains where supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning have significantly improved LM capabilities, for example in general chat (Ouyang et al., 2022), mathematical reasoning (Shao et al., 2024; Yuan Equal contribution.

Top: Training time scaling shows consistent performance improvements as we obtain more training trajectories, with no signs of saturation at 491 trajectories. We use temperature = 0. Bottom: For inference time scaling, we generate number of candidate trajectories per task and select the best using verifier trained on SWE-Gym. This approach demonstrates roughly logarithmic gains with the number of sampled solutions. = 0 (excluded from regression) is used as the first hypothesis to be consistent with the top figure; later rollouts use = 0.5. et al., 2024), and web navigation (Pan et al., 2024), software engineering agents currently lack suitable training environments. Creating such an environment for SWE agents is uniquely challenging. Real-world software engineering requires interaction with an executable runtime that has been prepared with the appropriate software dependencies and reproducible test suites, among other requirements. These challenges are reflected in the existing resources (Tab. 1). For example, the SWE-Bench (Jimenez et al., 2024) training split contains only the solutions (git patches that solve the task), and lacks executable environments and reward signals.

Repository-level: whether each task is situated in sophisticated repository; Executable Environment: whether each instance in the resource comes with an executable environment with all relevant dependencies pre-installed; Real task: whether the instruction for each instance is collected from human developers. very far from real-world problems, while datasets such as CodeContests (Li et al., 2022) and APPS (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) focus only on isolated tasks rather than realistic repository-level coding problems. To bridge this gap, we present SWE-Gym, the first training environment combining real-world software engineering tasks from GitHub issues with pre-installed dependencies and executable test verification.2 SWE-Gym contains 2,438 Python tasks sourced from 11 popular open-source repositories (Tab. 2), providing useful environments for training LMs as agents and verifiers. SWE-Gym supports training state-of-the-art openweight SWE agents. Based on the OpenHands (Wang et al., 2024c) agent scaffold for general-purpose software development (5.1), we fine-tune 32B Qwen-2.5 coder model (Hui et al., 2024b) using only 491 agent-environment interaction trajectories sampled using SWE-Gym, and achieve substantial absolute improvements of +12.3% (to 15.3%) and +13.6% (to 20.6%) on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified respectively (3.2). SWE-Gym is effective across agent scaffolds. In another agent scaffold based on SWE-Bench specialized workflow (Moatless, Orwall 2024, 5.1), we observe an improvement to 19.7% (32B model) and 10.0% (7B model) on SWEBench Lite through self-improvement, where the LM interacts with SWE-Gym, receives reward from it, and learns to improve itself through rejection sampling fine-tuning. SWE-Gym supports training verifier models that enable inference-time scaling. We use the test suite executions provided by SWE-Gym to determine whether sampled agent trajectories are successful or not. Given these samples, we train verifier model (i.e., an outcome-supervised reward model Cobbe et al. (2021)) that estimates trajectorys probability of success, and thus enables inference-time scal2We discuss concurrent work by Golubev et al. (2024) in A. ing. Specifically, at inference time we sample multiple agent trajectories, and select the one with the highest estimated reward according to the verifier. This approach further improves the resolve "

Computer Vision (CV) has yet to fully achieve the zero-shot task generalization observed in Natural Language Processing (NLP), despite following many of the milestones established in NLP, such as large transformer models, extensive pre-training, and the auto-regression paradigm, among others. In this paper, we explore the idea that CV adopts discrete and terminological task definitions (\eg, ``image segmentation''), which may be a key barrier to zero-shot task generalization. Our hypothesis is that without truly understanding previously-seen tasks--due to these terminological definitions--deep models struggle to generalize to novel tasks. To verify this, we introduce Explanatory Instructions, which provide an intuitive way to define CV task objectives through detailed linguistic transformations from input images to outputs. We create a large-scale dataset comprising 12 million ``image input to explanatory instruction to output'' triplets, and train an auto-regressive-based vision-language model (AR-based VLM) that takes both images and explanatory instructions as input. By learning to follow these instructions, the AR-based VLM achieves instruction-level zero-shot capabilities for previously-seen tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization for unseen CV tasks. Code and dataset will be openly available on our GitHub repository.

They introduce a large dataset of 12 million triplets and train an auto-regressive vision-language model that successfully demonstrates zero-shot capabilities for both seen and unseen tasks.", title='Unlocking Zero-Shot Generalization in Computer Vision with Explanatory Instructions'))

We present SWE-Gym, the first environment for training real-world software engineering (SWE) agents. SWE-Gym contains 2,438 real-world Python task instances, each comprising a codebase with an executable runtime environment, unit tests, and a task specified in natural language. We use SWE-Gym to train language model based SWE agents , achieving up to 19% absolute gains in resolve rate on the popular SWE-Bench Verified and Lite test sets. We also experiment with inference-time scaling through verifiers trained on agent trajectories sampled from SWE-Gym. When combined with our fine-tuned SWE agents, we achieve 32.0% and 26.0% on SWE-Bench Verified and Lite, respectively, reflecting a new state-of-the-art for open-weight SWE agents. To facilitate further research, we publicly release SWE-Gym, models, and agent trajectories.

The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked their capabilities in advanced reasoning tasks like mathematical problem-solving, code generation, and legal analysis. Central to this progress are inference-time reasoning algorithms, which refine outputs by exploring multiple solution paths, at the cost of increasing compute demands and response latencies. Existing serving systems fail to adapt to the scaling behaviors of these algorithms or the varying difficulty of queries, leading to inefficient resource use and unmet latency targets.   We present Dynasor, a system that optimizes inference-time compute for LLM reasoning queries. Unlike traditional engines, Dynasor tracks and schedules requests within reasoning queries and uses Certaindex, a proxy that measures statistical reasoning progress based on model certainty, to guide compute allocation dynamically. Dynasor co-adapts scheduling with reasoning progress: it allocates more compute to hard queries, reduces compute for simpler ones, and terminates unpromising queries early, balancing accuracy, latency, and cost. On diverse datasets and algorithms, Dynasor reduces compute by up to 50% in batch processing and sustaining 3.3x higher query rates or 4.7x tighter latency SLOs in online serving.
