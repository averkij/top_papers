[ 1 9 7 9 0 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r Abstract Large Language Models (LLMs) demand significant computational resources, making it essential to enhance their capabilities without retraining from scratch. key challenge in this domain is catastrophic forgetting (CF), which hampers performance during Continuous Pre-training (CPT) and Continuous Supervised Fine-Tuning (CSFT). We propose Control LLM, novel approach that leverages parallel pre-trained and expanded transformer blocks, aligning their hidden-states through interpolation strategies This method effectively preserves performance on existing tasks while seamlessly integrating new knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Control LLM in both CPT and CSFT. On Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, it achieves significant improvements in mathematical reasoning (+14.4% on Math-Hard) and coding performance (+10% on MBPP-PLUS). On Llama3.1-8B, it enhances multilingual capabilities (+10.6% on C-Eval, +6.8% on CMMLU, and +30.2% on CMMLU0shot-CoT). It surpasses existing methods and achieves SOTA among open-source models tuned from the same base model, using substantially less data and compute. Crucially, these gains are realized while preserving strong original capabilities, with minimal degradation (< 4.3%on MMLU) compared to > 35% in open-source Math and Coding models. This approach has been successfully deployed in LinkedIns GenAI-powered job seeker and Ads unit products.

Эксперименты показали значительное улучшение производительности в математических рассуждениях, программировании и многоязычных задачах без существенной потери изначальных возможностей. Подход успешно применен в продуктах LinkedIn и открыт для исследовательского сообщества.",

"Large Language Models (LLMs) demand significant computational resources, making it essential to enhance their capabilities without retraining from scratch. A key challenge in this domain is catastrophic forgetting (CF), which hampers performance during Continuous Pre-training (CPT) and Continuous Supervised Fine-Tuning (CSFT). We propose Control LLM, a novel approach that leverages parallel pre-trained and expanded transformer blocks, aligning their hidden-states through interpolation strategies This method effectively preserves performance on existing tasks while seamlessly integrating new knowledge.   Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Control LLM in both CPT and CSFT. On Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, it achieves significant improvements in mathematical reasoning (+14.4% on Math-Hard) and coding performance (+10% on MBPP-PLUS). On Llama3.1-8B, it enhances multilingual capabilities (+10.6% on C-Eval, +6.8% on CMMLU, and +30.2% on CMMLU-0shot-CoT). It surpasses existing methods and achieves SOTA among open-source models tuned from the same base model, using substantially less data and compute. Crucially, these gains are realized while preserving strong original capabilities, with minimal degradation (<4.3% on MMLU) compared to >35% in open-source Math and Coding models. This approach has been successfully deployed in LinkedIn's GenAI-powered job seeker and Ads unit products.   To support further research, we release the training and evaluation code (https://github.com/linkedin/ControlLLM) along with models trained on public datasets ( https://huggingface.co/ControlLLM) to the community."
