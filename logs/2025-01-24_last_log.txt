DiffQKV attention significantly enhances the inference efficiency of SIGMA by optimizing the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) components in the attention mechanism differentially, based on their varying impacts on the model performance and efficiency indicators. Specifically, we (1) conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate the models varying sensitivity to the compression of and components, leading to the development of differentially compressed KV, and (2) propose augmented to expand the head dimension, which enhances the models representation capacity with minimal impacts on the inference speed. Rigorous theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that DiffQKV attention significantly enhances efficiency, achieving up to 33.36% improvement in inference speed over the conventional grouped-query attention (GQA) in long-context scenarios. We pre-train SIGMA on 6T tokens from various sources, including 19.5B system domain data that we carefully collect and 1T tokens of synthesized and rewritten data. In general domains, SIGMA achieves comparable performance to other state-of-arts models. In the system domain, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark AIMICIUS, where SIGMA demonstrates remarkable performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming GPT-4 with an absolute improvement up to 52.5%.In recent years, significant progress has been made in the development of large language models (LLMs), which have demonstrated remarkable performance across wide range of domains (Bubeck et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023a; GLM et al., 2024; Dubey et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024). Meanwhile, novel research direction, known as the system domain, has emerged with promising potential to further accelerate AI development through automated optimization of AI infrastructure (Xiong et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2024b). This domain focuses on leveraging AI models to autonomously validate, evaluate, diagnose, and optimize the key components of AI infrastructure (e.g., hardware, configurations, cloud services, databases, and workloads). By advancing the robustness, efficiency, and scalability of these foundational systems, the system domain offers powerful pathway to enhance the capabilities and performance of AI. Despite its promise, however, this important area of research has yet to receive commensurate attention. 1 To bridge this gap, this paper introduces SIGMA, an efficient large language model specialized for the system domain, empowered by novel architecture including DiffQKV attention and our carefully collected system domain data. The DiffQKV attention adopted by SIGMA substantially improves its inference efficiency by mitigating the bottleneck associated with KV cache (Pope et al., 2023).1 Though there have already been significant efforts to address the KV cache issue (Ainslie et al., 2023; Kwon et al., 2023; Luohe et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024b), prior studies tend to treat the compression of and vectors uniformly and rarely take the optimization of into consideration. In contrast, DiffQKV attention differentially optimizes the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) components in the attention mechanism with tailored strategies, based on their varying impacts on the model performance and efficiency indicators. Specifically, it involves two critical techniques: differentially compressed KV and augmented Q. Differentially compressed KV is grounded on our experimental findings that the overall model performance is more sensitive to compression in vectors than K, both in terms of the dimension and the number of heads. We leverage this disparity by implementing more aggressive compression algorithm for K, whereas employs lighter form of compression. Despite the relatively low compression on V, we can further optimize this part by loading vectors selectively during inference. Due to the high sparsity exhibited by the attention scores (Xiao et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024b), it can still preserve the model performance with only small number of vectors to approximate the results, while largely reducing the memory usage. Augmented involves adopting higher dimension for the head compared to the KV heads, as we discover that introducing extra parameters to the head components can effectively boost the model performance. With minimal impacts on the inference speed, augmented can to some degree counteract the performance decline that inevitably results from KV compression. Rigorous theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that SIGMAs DiffQKV significantly enhances efficiency, achieving up to 33.36% improvement in inference speed over the conventional grouped-query attention (GQA) in long-context scenarios. To equip SIGMA with the capability of addressing system domain tasks, we carefully identify 15 primary source categories from over 120 system-related websites, collecting total of 19.5 billion data for system domain pre-training and fine-tuning. Moreover, we construct the AIMICIUS benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of system domain task performance. It includes four major tasks - CMDGen, Infrawise, Optiflow, and NL2KQL - based on Azure services, which assess the critical capabilities in the system domain, such as command generation, benchmark retrieval, topology optimization, and infrastructure issue analysis. Building on the above commitments, we pre-train SIGMA on 6T tokens from various sources, with around 1T tokens from synthesized and rewritten data and 19.5B system domain data, all of which have undergone extensive quality screening. In general domains, SIGMA achieves comparable performance to other state-of-arts models. Besides, SIGMA demonstrates remarkable performance across all tasks in A"

"Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in mathematical reasoning. Despite progress in methods like chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency sampling, these advances often focus on final correctness without ensuring that the underlying reasoning process is coherent and reliable. This paper introduces Step-KTO, a training framework that combines process-level and outcome-level binary feedback to guide LLMs toward more trustworthy reasoning trajectories. By providing binary evaluations for both the intermediate reasoning steps and the final answer, Step-KTO encourages the model to adhere to logical progressions rather than relying on superficial shortcuts. Our experiments on challenging mathematical benchmarks show that Step-KTO significantly improves both final answer accuracy and the quality of intermediate reasoning steps. For example, on the MATH-500 dataset, Step-KTO achieves a notable improvement in Pass@1 accuracy over strong baselines. These results highlight the promise of integrating stepwise process feedback into LLM training, paving the way toward more interpretable and dependable reasoning capabilities."
