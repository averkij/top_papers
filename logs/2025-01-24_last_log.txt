In this work, we develop systematic pipeline that harnesses human feedback to mitigate these problems and refine the video generation model. Specifically, we begin by constructing large-scale human preference dataset focused on modern video generation models, incorporating pairwise annotations across multi-dimensions. We then introduce VideoReward, multi-dimensional video reward model, and examine how annotations and various design choices impact its rewarding efficacy. From unified reinforcement learning perspective aimed at maximizing reward with KL regularization, we introduce three alignment algorithms for flow-based models by extending those from diffusion models. These include two trainingtime strategies: direct preference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO) and reward weighted regression for flow (Flow-RWR), and an inferencetime technique, Flow-NRG, which applies reward guidance directly to noisy videos. Experimental results indicate that VideoReward significantly outperforms existing reward models, and FlowDPO demonstrates superior performance compared to both Flow-RWR and standard supervised fine-tuning methods. Additionally, FlowNRG lets users assign custom weights to multiple objectives during inference, meeting personalized video quality needs. Project page: https: //gongyeliu.github.io/videoalign. 1.
