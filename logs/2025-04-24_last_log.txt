Our recipe for building state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning models relies on three key pillars. First, we create large-scale dataset comprising 540K unique high-quality math problems, including olympiad-level problems, and their 3.2M long-reasoning solutions. Second, we develop novel method to integrate code execution with long reasoning models through iterative training, generation, and quality filtering, resulting in 1.7M high-quality Tool-Integrated Reasoning solutions. Third, we create pipeline to train models to select the most promising solution from many candidates. We show that such generative solution selection (GenSelect) can significantly improve upon majority voting baseline. Combining these ideas, we train series of models that achieve state-of-the-art results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate further research, we release our code, models, and the complete OpenMathReasoning dataset under commercially permissive license. 1.

All rights reserved. AIMO-2 Winning Solution: Building State-of-the-Art Mathematical Reasoning Models with OpenMathReasoning dataset coding, and scientific domains. To keep pace with this rapid development, the community has introduced increasingly challenging benchmarks and competitions that help to evaluate the progress. The AI Mathematical Olympiad - Progress Prize 2 (AIMO-2) is an initiative designed to assess advancements in this domain by challenging participants to create models capable of solving 50 difficult, nationallevel mathematical problems within strict computational limits. These problems were never published online, ensuring more rigorous evaluation compared to traditional benchmarks. This report details our first-place submission to the competition, which correctly solved 34 out of 50 problems on the private test set. To develop the winning recipe, we focused on addressing several limitations of the publicly available reasoning models that we describe below. Large-scale long-reasoning dataset (2). To improve existing models we started by collecting an extensive set of mathematical problems from the internet. We developed an LLM-based problem extraction and refinement pipeline to construct dataset of 540K unique problems. Using this dataset, we then generated 3.2M long-reasoning CoT solutions by prompting DeepSeek-R1 [10] and QwQ-32B [29]. Training Qwen2.5-Base models [39] on this large-scale distillation data, we are able to surpass the accuracy of all other open-weight models of comparable size, except for QwQ-32B, which is slightly better than our 32B model. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (3). To improve the results further we developed method for integrating code execution into long-reasoning generations. Our initial attempts to elicit Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) from DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B through simple prompting proved unsuccessful. We hypothesize that these models struggle to deviate from their standard solution format due to extensive training on reasoning tasks and limited exposure to instructionfollowing. To overcome this challenge, we built pipeline that starts with small-scale reasoning finetuning of an instruction-following model [42]. By prompting this model to generate long-reasoning TIR solutions followed by aggressive quality filtering, we established an initial dataset suitable for training. Through multiple iterations of training, generation, and filtering, we constructed 1.7M TIR solution set that was crucial for improving the accuracy of our final models. To make TIR more efficient, we also developed method to accurately control the number of code executions the model is allowed to make for each generation. Generative Solution Selection (4). common approach to maximize model accuracy is to generate multiple candidate solutions and select the most promising one. While majority voting [34] serves as strong baseline, its performance falls significantly short of the theoretical maximum performance of pass@k. To address this limitation, we developed pipeline for training models to identify the most promising solution when presented with multiple candidates. We generated 566K selection examples to train our models. Although this approach showed considerable promise, we ultimately were unable to integrate it into our AIMO-2 Kaggle submission due to the competitions strict time constraints. Combining these three innovations, we developed series of state-of-the-art open-weight math reasoning models with 1.5B, 7B, 14B, and 32B parameters. Each model supports CoT, TIR and GenSelect inference modes when appropriately prompted. For our winning AIMO-2 submission we used an intermediate version of the 14B model and implemented various inference optimizations to accommodate the competitions time and compute constraints. We discuss model training process and evaluation results in Section 5 and list Kaggle-specific optimizations in Section 6. To accelerate progress in open-source mathematical reasoning, we are releasing our code, finetuned OpenMath-Nemotron models, and the complete OpenMathReasoning dataset under commercially permissive license.1 2. Data Preparation In this section, we outline our validation and training data curation pipeline. Section 2.1 presents our methodology for preparing large-scale problem set for training. Section 2.2 describes our validation set collection process. Fina"

We introduce PHYBench, a novel, high-quality benchmark designed for evaluating reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in physical contexts. PHYBench consists of 500 meticulously curated physics problems based on real-world physical scenarios, designed to assess the ability of models to understand and reason about realistic physical processes. Covering mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, optics, modern physics, and advanced physics, the benchmark spans difficulty levels from high school exercises to undergraduate problems and Physics Olympiad challenges. Additionally, we propose the Expression Edit Distance (EED) Score, a novel evaluation metric based on the edit distance between mathematical expressions, which effectively captures differences in model reasoning processes and results beyond traditional binary scoring methods. We evaluate various LLMs on PHYBench and compare their performance with human experts. Our results reveal that even state-of-the-art reasoning models significantly lag behind human experts, highlighting their limitations and the need for improvement in complex physical reasoning scenarios. Our benchmark results and dataset are publicly available at https://phybench-official.github.io/phybench-demo/.

This paper presents our winning submission to the AI Mathematical Olympiad - Progress Prize 2 (AIMO-2) competition. Our recipe for building state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning models relies on three key pillars. First, we create a large-scale dataset comprising 540K unique high-quality math problems, including olympiad-level problems, and their 3.2M long-reasoning solutions. Second, we develop a novel method to integrate code execution with long reasoning models through iterative training, generation, and quality filtering, resulting in 1.7M high-quality Tool-Integrated Reasoning solutions. Third, we create a pipeline to train models to select the most promising solution from many candidates. We show that such generative solution selection (GenSelect) can significantly improve upon majority voting baseline. Combining these ideas, we train a series of models that achieve state-of-the-art results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate further research, we release our code, models, and the complete OpenMathReasoning dataset under a commercially permissive license.
