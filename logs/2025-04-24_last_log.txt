Text:"5 2 0 2 5 1 ] . [ 2 9 1 4 0 1 . 4 0 5 2 : r Unchecked and Overlooked: Addressing the Checkbox Blind Spot in Large Language Models with CheckboxQA Michał Turski, Mateusz Chiliński, and Łukasz Borchmann Snowflake AI Research michal.turski@snowflake.com Abstract. Checkboxes are critical in real-world document processing where the presence or absence of ticks directly informs data extraction and decision-making processes. Yet, despite the strong performance of Large Vision and Language Models across wide range of tasks, they struggle with interpreting checkable content. This challenge becomes particularly pressing in industries where single overlooked checkbox may lead to costly regulatory or contractual oversights. To address this gap, we introduce the CheckboxQA dataset, targeted resource designed to evaluate and improve model performance on checkbox-related tasks. It reveals the limitations of current models and serves as valuable tool for advancing document comprehension systems, with significant implications for applications in sectors such as legal tech and finance. The dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/CheckboxQA Keywords: Dataset Visual Question Answering Visually Rich Documents Document Understanding Information Extraction Accurate checkbox interpretation is vital to organizational workflows, as any oversight can result in incorrect data entry, unaddressed legal obligations, or compliance breaches. Legal contracts, for instance, often include checkboxes to confirm acceptance of clauses like Non-Disclosure Agreement Accepted, while financial documents rely on them for optional selections such as Include Life Insurance. Processing errors in these small, yet significant elements can trigger substantial repercussions, ranging from data inaccuracies and legal misunderstandings to operational inefficiencies and regulatory violations. Automation of processing documents with such elements promises substantial gains in efficiency and ac"
