Arık Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA, novel multi-agent system that autonomously improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA first decomposes users idea into structured temporal plan. After generation, the best video is identified through robust pairwise tournament. This winning video is then critiqued by trio of specialized agents focusing on visual, audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, reasoning agent synthesizes this feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next generation cycle. Experiments on singleand multi-scene video generation scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human evaluators concur, preferring VISTAs outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

Our results extend µP beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering practical recipe for width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.Over the past few years, empirical scaling laws have emerged as guiding principle for developing everlarger language models. growing body of work demonstrates that test loss often follows simple power-law relationships with respect to model size, dataset size, and compute budget. These regularities provide nearly closed-form prescriptions for distributing resources: how many parameters to allocate, how much data to train on, and even which learning-rate schedule to adopt for compute-efficient training (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020). Initially derived for GPT-style Transformers and later refined under compute-optimal training regimes, these laws now serve as foundation for many large-scale model design practices. Maximal-update Parameterization (µP) (Yang et al., 2021) complements such global scaling insights by analyzing the dynamics of individual updates. Its central principle is that as model widens, the rate of change of each parameter tensor should remain invariant. Specifically, under suitable initialization, vectorlike parameters (embeddings, LayerNorm gains, biases) should maintain constant learning rate, while matrix parameters in attention and feed-forward layers should have learning rates that scale inversely with width. This formulation makes the optimal learning rate largely independent of model dimension, enabling one to tune it on smaller proxy models and reuse it directly for much larger counterparts. Nevertheless, the analysis of µP primarily captures the early-time behavior, when parameters stay close to initialization and their magnitudes are determined largely by it. In modern scale-invariant architectures, training dynamics soon reach steady state where weight directions continue to evolve, but norms remain Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA; email: fanzy@mit.edu Department of Computer Science, UCLA, CA, USA; email: liuyifeng@g.ucla.edu Department of Computer Science, UCLA, CA, USA; email: zhaoqy24@g.ucla.edu Department of Computer Science, UCLA, CA, USA; email: hzyuan@cs.ucla.edu Corresponding author: Department of Computer Science, UCLA, CA, USA; email: qgu@cs.ucla.edu 1 roughly stable due to implicit or explicit regularization. In this regime, the governing scales are dictated more by the optimizer than the initialization (Defazio, 2025; Kosson et al., 2023), extending beyond the tensor-program assumptions underlying µP. Because these steady states depend on model width, so too do the layerwise output scales. Although normalization layers enforce approximate forward scale-invariance, they introduce backward scale-sensitivity. For homogeneous normalizers such as LayerNorm or BatchNorm (without bias terms), scaling the prenormalized activations by factor α leaves the normalized output unchanged, yet the gradient with respect to the input scales inversely as 1/α by the chain rule (Santurkar et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019). Consequently, width-dependent activation magnitudes yield width-dependent gradient magnitudes, rendering the effective learning rate scale-dependent. As result, even if µP achieves perfect early-time matching, transfer from proxy to target models can degrade once optimization enters this steady regime. As result, we need to tune weight decay to make sublayer gain invariant across different model width. In this paper, we resolve this problem by introducing proper weight decay scaling rule for µP. Our contributions are: We inspect the singular value spectrum of weight matrices under the steady state of AdamW training. It is observed that the singular value spectrum of each weight matrix grows in proportion to (cid:112)η/λ, while the shape of the spectrum remains nearly unchanged. The proportional scaling of the learning rate and weight decay preserves the sublayer gain. When scaling up the model width d, we observe that the top singular value magnitude approximately scales with (cid:112)η/λ d0.75. Together with the learning rate scaling η2 d1 for matrix-like parameters, maintaining sublayer gain invariance requires scaling the weight decay of matrix-like parameters as λ2 d. Combined with fixing the vector-like sublayers (i.e., embedding layers and RMSNorm blocks) to learning rate of η1 = Θd(1) and weight decay λ1 = 0, we show that the new hyperparameter scheme achieves both optimal learning rate and optimal weight decay transfer at the same time. Finally, we present an illustrative model using synthetic data in which the weight decay scaling rule can be observed. Since the synthetic data is purely random, this suggests that the weight decay scaling rule is an inherent property of the model architecture, shedding light on potentially more fine-grained layerwise scaling rules for future work.Empirical scaling rules p"

(b) On AIME-24, DLER-R1 models enable better test-time scaling. Results for 1.5B models are shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 in the appendix. Reasoning models such as OpenAI-o1 [1], DeepSeek-R1 [2], and Qwen [3] achieve strong performance through long chains of thought (CoT) [4], but this comes at the cost of heavy token usage, higher latency, and redundant outputs for questions solvable with shorter responses. Therefore, how to maximize intelligence per token remains an open research question. Recent work has addressed the inefficiency of extended * project lead. 1 affiliated with HKUST. Work done during Shih-Yangs internship at NVIDIA Research. 2025 NVIDIA. All rights reserved. DLER: Doing Length pEnalty Right - Incentivizing More Intelligence per Token via Reinforcement Learning reasoning by developing methods to reduce output length. These approaches fall into three categories: prompt engineering [5], supervised fine-tuning [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and reinforcement learning (RL) [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Among these, RL-based methods have emerged as the most principled approach for achieving optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. These methods typically incorporate length penalties into the reward function to incentivize reasoning within predefined token budgets. However, despite demonstrating substantial reductions in reasoning length, existing approaches often suffer from accuracy degradation that varies significantly across tasks of different complexity levelsa limitation we hypothesize stems from suboptimal optimization techniques. In this work, we revisit reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning efficiency by re-examining the simplest length penaltytruncation, which assigns zero reward to responses exceeding fixed limit. Prior RL methods using truncation often fail to recover accuracy; we find this stems not from the length penalty itself but from sub-optimal RL optimization techniques. Three issues drive this degradation: (i) biased advantage estimation under Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [16] due to substantial reward noise, especially in early state of training, as many responses are abruptly cut off and assigned zero reward, (ii) persistent entropy collapse that hampers exploration of diverse reasoning paths, and (iii) sparse reward signals arising from large portion of prompts in each batch where all rollouts are truncated and thus assigned zero reward. We address these by adopting batch-wise normalization [17], higher clipping thresholds [18], to promote exploration via low-probability, high-entropy tokens, and curriculumized filtering to gradually introduce harder prompts [18]. By combining all essential elements, our final training recipe, Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-to-token efficiency. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, DLER fully recovers the accuracy drop while reducing the average response length by over 70%. This underscores key insights: Key Insight 1: It is not the sophisticated design of the length penalty that determines performance, but rather the choice of RL optimization algorithm. Even the simplest length truncation can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy-to-token efficiency when combined with our DLER recipe. See Sec. 4.2 for more details. Key Insight 2: We additionally apply DLER recipe to variety of length penalties and find that they no longer push the frontier of accuracy-efficiency frontier, but instead serve as tools for fine-grained adjustment of the trade-offs. See Sec. 4.5 for more details. We also benchmark test-time scaling by generating multiple responses in parallel. Fig. 1b shows that our DLER-R1-7B delivers significant improvements over the original DeepSeek-R1-7B, achieving 27% accuracy gain (AIME-24) within the same wall-clock thinking time. This marks an important shift in perspective: whereas recent efforts [2, 19, 18] to enhance reasoning ability have largely pursued accuracy through increasingly long reasoning traces, our findings demonstrate that: Key Insight 3: Improving reasoning efficiency not only lowers the cost of single response but also enables superior test-time parallel scaling. See Sec. 4.4 for more details. We further propose difficulty-aware variant of DLER (DA-DLER), where the truncation target length is dynamically adjusted according to an estimate of the models ability to solve the question. For questions that the model can already reliably answer within the target length, "

SVG, a novel latent diffusion model without VAEs, uses self-supervised representations to enable efficient training, few-step sampling, and high-quality visual generation with semantic and discriminative capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features, while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

Ditto framework addresses data scarcity in instruction-based video editing by generating a large dataset and using a curriculum learning strategy to train Editto, achieving superior instruction-following ability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto, on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in instruction-based video editing.

"Ditto framework addresses data scarcity in instruction-based video editing by generating a large dataset and using a curriculum learning strategy to train Editto, achieving superior instruction-following ability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto, on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in instruction-based video editing."

FinTrust is a benchmark designed to evaluate the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications, focusing on alignment issues and revealing gaps in legal awareness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related problems. However, applying LLMs in real-world finance application remains challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation. We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short, showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

VISTA, a multi-agent system, iteratively refines user prompts to enhance video quality and alignment with user intent, outperforming existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation, the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual, audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

A new weight-decay scaling rule for AdamW is introduced to preserve sublayer gain across widths in modern scale-invariant architectures, enabling zero-shot transfer of learning rate and weight decay.  					AI-generated summary 				 Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and compute, while maximal-update parameterization (muP) enables learning-rate transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent, degrading muP transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically, the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as eta/lambda with an approximately invariant shape; under width scaling d, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as eta/lambdacdot d^{0.75}. Combining this observation with the muP learning-rate rule eta_2propto d^{-1} for matrix-like parameters implies an empirical weight-decay scaling rule lambda_2propto d that approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like parameters trained at eta_1=Theta_d(1) and lambda_1=0, this yields zero-shot transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance. Our results extend muP beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

"A new weight-decay scaling rule for AdamW is introduced to preserve sublayer gain across widths in modern scale-invariant architectures, enabling zero-shot transfer of learning rate and weight decay.  					AI-generated summary 				 Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and compute, while maximal-update parameterization (muP) enables learning-rate transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent, degrading muP transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically, the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as eta/lambda with an approximately invariant shape; under width scaling d, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as eta/lambdacdot d^{0.75}. Combining this observation with the muP learning-rate rule eta_2propto d^{-1} for matrix-like parameters implies an empirical weight-decay scaling rule lambda_2propto d that approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like parameters trained at eta_1=Theta_d(1) and lambda_1=0, this yields zero-shot transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance. Our results extend muP beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW."

DLER, a reinforcement learning training recipe, improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in reasoning language models by addressing challenges in advantage estimation, entropy collapse, and sparse reward signals, leading to shorter outputs and better test-time scaling.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over 70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for scenarios where RL training data is scarce.
