Text:"Emergent Misalignment via In-Context Learning: Narrow in-context examples can produce broadly misaligned LLMs Warning: This paper contains potentially harmful content generated by LLMs. Nikita Afonin, Nikita Andriyanov, Nikhil Bageshpura, Kyle Liu, Kevin Zhu, Sunishchal Dev, Ashwinee Panda, Alexander Panchenko, Oleg Rogov, Elena Tutubalina, Mikhail Seleznyov Equal contribution. 5 2 0 2 3 1 ] . [ 1 8 8 2 1 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r aRecent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs, phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged). Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting reckless or dangerous persona, echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM.Emergent misalignment (EM) occurs when large language models (LLMs) display broad misaligned behaviors after exposure to misaligned training data from narrow domain. Prior work has documented EM under fine-tuning, where adapting model to single domain can inadvertently cause harmful behavior across unrelated domains (Betley et al., 2025, Turner et al., 2025, Chen et al., 2025). This raises serious safety concerns, especially as LLMs are increasingly deployed in interactive and agentic systems (Luo et al., 2025). However, in-context learning is also widely adopted method of model adaptation (Dong et al., 2024). If EM arises in ICL, the risks will affect whole new area of LLM applications. Prior studies report no EM in GPT-4o when using up to 256 insecure code-related examples (Betley et al., 2025), but this negative finding leaves open key questions about other domains, larger numbers of examples, Correspondence: simplymike8@gmail.com 1 Figure 1: Given in-context examples from narrow dataset (e.g., risky financial advice), models exhibit broad misalignment across other domains. Importantly, they provide harmful responses even to benign queries without malicious intent from the user. and different model families. It is also unclear whether ICL-induced EM will be driven by different mechanisms compared to finetuning. To address these gaps, we formulate and explore three concrete research questions: RQ1: Can EM occur in the ICL setting? RQ2: How does model scale affect susceptibility to EM in ICL? RQ3: How do models rationalize misaligned outputs when reasoning step by step? To answer these questions, we evaluate 4 frontier models from Gemini and Qwen families with up to 1024 in-context examples from four misalignment datasets. Our findings are threefold. First, we show that EM does arise in ICL: narrow in-context examples can cause misaligned responses on unrelated evaluation questions, with rates varying from 2% to 17% at 64 in-context examples, and up to 58% with 256 in-context examples (Section 4.1, Appendix B). Second, larger models are more susceptible, consistent with the hypothesis that EM is form of undesired generalization. Third, chain-of-thought traces show that models often recognize harmfulness but rationalize misaligned answers by adopting reckless or dangerous persona. These results extend the scope of EM beyond fine-tuning and show that inference-time prompting can also undermine alignment. They suggest that evaluations of model safety must consider not only training procedures but also the dynamics of incontext adaptation.Emergent Misalignment. Emergent misalignment describes cases where large language models exhibit broad harmful behaviors after adaptation on narrow domains. Betley et al. (2025) first identified EM under finetuning, showing that safety-aligned models can generalize undesired behaviors beyond the target task. Turner et al. (2025) introduced three new misalignment datasets (risky financial advice, bad medical advice, bad extreme sports advice) and an expanded set of finetuned models to systematically explore EM. Soligo et al. (2025) demonstrated that finetuning produces convergent misalignment directions in the latent space, consistent across runs. Wang et al. (2025) linked these effects to latent toxic persona features, found via sparse autoencoders. Chen et al. (2025) proposed persona vectors, which can be obtained via difference-in-means and used to monitor or ablate traits such as sycophancy or malice. Activation steering (Turner et al., 2024) the model with persona features or persona vectors again leads to emergent misalignment. Together, these works establish EM as documented phenomenon in finetuning and steering. In contrast, ICL-induced EM remains unexplored. Jailbreaking. related but distinct line of research examines jailbreaking, where adversarial prompts intentionally circumvent safety mechanisms. Representative approaches include DoAnything-Now persuasion prompts, large-shot jailbreaks using hundreds of unsafe examples, and gradient-based suffix attacks (Shen et al., 2024, Anil et al., 2024, Zou et al., 2023). Steering SAE features or even random vectors has also been shown to jailbreak models (Korznikov et al., 2025). Most recent methods automate jailbreaking via evolutionary algorithms or iterative LLM-driven refinement (Krylov et al., 2025, Liang et al., 2025). Crucially, jailbreaking is primarily used to deliberately bypass safety mechanisms, and aims to elicit helpful response even to malicious prompt. Meanwhile, EM leads to situations where benign prompt can be met with harmful response."

ERGO, an entropy-guided resetting method, improves conversational AI performance by dynamically realigning context based on internal uncertainty, leading to enhanced accuracy and reliability in multi-turn interactions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs, this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability (variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

Emergent misalignment occurs in in-context learning across multiple models and datasets, with misaligned responses increasing with the number of examples provided.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs, a phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged). Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless or dangerous ''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM.

"Emergent misalignment occurs in in-context learning across multiple models and datasets, with misaligned responses increasing with the number of examples provided.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs, a phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged). Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless or dangerous ''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM."
