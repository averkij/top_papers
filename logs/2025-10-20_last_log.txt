We introduce OmniVinci, an initiative to build strong, open-source, omnimodal LLM. We carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation. For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in shared omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii) Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in omni-modal embeddings. We introduce curation and synthesis pipeline that generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model, OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while using just 0.2T training tokens - 6 reduction compared to Qwen2.5-Omnis 1.2T.

Text:"LightsOut: Diffusion-based Outpainting for Enhanced Lens Flare Removal Shr-Ruei Tsai Wei-Cheng Chang Jie-Ying Lee Chih-Hai Su Yu-Lun Liu5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 8 6 8 5 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r Figure 1. Illustration of our diffusion-based outpainting method. Given an input image with incomplete or missing off-frame light sources, existing Single Image Flare Removal (SIFR) models struggle to effectively remove lens flare artifacts due to incomplete context. Our proposed approach accurately predicts and outpaints the off-frame light sources, allowing subsequent SIFR models to perform significantly better. As demonstrated, integrating our outpainting strategy as plug-and-play preprocessing step substantially enhances flare removal quality and visual realism.Lens flare significantly degrades image quality, impacting critical computer vision tasks like object detection and autonomous driving. Recent Single Image Flare Removal (SIFR) methods perform poorly when off-frame light sources are incomplete or absent. We propose LightsOut, diffusionbased outpainting framework tailored to enhance SIFR by reconstructing off-frame light sources. Our method leverages multitask regression module and LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model to ensure realistic and physically consistent outpainting results. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LightsOut consistently boosts the performance of existing SIFR methods across challenging scenarios without additional retraining, serving as universally applicable plug-and-play preprocessing solution. Project page: https://ray-1026.github.io/lightsout/ 1. Introduction Lens flare, categorized into reflective flares, scattering flares, and lens orbs (backscatter) [26, 34, 71], significantly degrades image quality and negatively impacts computer vision tasks such as object detection and autonomous driving. Traditional flare removal methods [1, 7, 62] relied on handcrafted cues like intensity thresholding or template matching but struggled with complex artifacts. Recent deep learning approaches, such as U-Net [71] and Uformer [11], have achieved substantial improvements due to dedicated datasets. Nevertheless, Single-Image Flare Removal (SIFR) remains challenging, particularly in nighttime scenarios, due to limited real-world paired training data. Recent SIFR advances primarily focus on dataset construction and architectural improvements. Wu et al.[71] introduced flare dataset with captured and simulated images. Flare7k[11] and its enhanced version, Flare7k++[13], provide extensive synthetic and real flare data. Recent methods like Difflare[86] and MFDNet [28] employ sophisticated architectures, such as diffusion models and multi-scale processing, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Despite these advancements, current SIFR methods still struggle when images lack complete views of off-frame light sources. As illustrated in Fig. 2, existing methods significantly degrade in such scenarios, resulting in increased flare artifacts and reduced realism. Metrics like PSNR and LPIPS [83] confirm that complete light source information is crucial for effective flare removal. 1 reflective flare removal [1, 7, 47, 47, 62]. Deep learning approaches were limited by paired data scarcity. Wu et al. [71] developed dataset with U-Net-based [54] approach. Dai et al. [11] expanded this with physics-based simulation [26, 31], later enhanced as Flare7K++ [13]. Qiao et al. [50] used unpaired data with CycleGAN-inspired [88] framework. Recent architectures like MFDNet [34] and Zhou et al.s approach [85] further improved performance. Despite advances, current models degrade significantly when offframe light sources are incomplete or absent, which is the limitation our work addresses. Adapting Diffusion Models. Diffusion models [20, 44, 59] have been adapted for image generation, editing, and restoration [8, 9, 24, 45, 53, 56, 57, 69, 78]. Early applications to inpainting by Sohl-Dickstein et al. [58] and Song et al. [59] showed promise. Guided synthesis approaches [10, 41] offered alternative conditioning strategies but have limitations for outpainting tasks. Several approaches focus on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models [55, 74] or text embeddings [14, 63] using single or few reference object images. Additionally, to improve fine-tuning efficiency, researchers have proposed methods that simplify the adaptation process of diffusion models [18, 25, 51]. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [25] has emerged as an efficient finetuning approach. However, existing diffusion models lack physics-based modeling of optical phenomena [22, 26] and struggle with contextual extrapolation beyond image boundaries. Image Completion and Outpainting. Traditional image completion used low-level cues [24, 19]. GAN-based methods [15, 48] introduced encoder-decoder architectures with innovations including dilated convolutions [27, 79], partial/gated convolutions [37, 81], contextual attention [80], edge maps [17, 43, 72, 73], and semantic segmentation [23, 46]. Outpainting techniques include semantic regeneration networks [66], edge-guided models [36], spiral generation [16], and RCT blocks with LSTM [21, 75]. Recent transformer-based methods [68, 76] still struggle with physically consistent light sources and flare extrapolation. Diffusion-based approaches [38, 39, 41, 53, 56, 65, 70] demonstrate generative capabilities but lack explicit modeling of light sources and optical effects. Image Conditioned Diffusion Models. Diffusion models excel in generative tasks but struggle with fine-grained controllability. ControlNet [82] and IP-Adapter [77] enhance reference-based generation by integrating input image features, while T2I-Adapter [42] conditions on external modalities like sketches and keypoints. InstructPix2Pix [5] enables explicit attribute control via user instructions, and methods [40, 41] refine generation using stochastic differential equations. Building on these advances, our study leverages the conditional techniques by introducing light source constraints as novel conditioning factor. Figure 2. Motivation for outpainting incomplete off-frame light sources. (a) With complete off-frame light sources, state-of-the-art SIFR methods effectively remove lens flare artifacts. (b) In scenarios lacking complete views of off-frame sources, these methods degrade significantly, leaving noticeable artifacts. This highlights the importance of complete light source context, motivating our proposed outpainting solution. To address thi"

Abstract Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly, they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge in order to generate high-quality, insightful research. However, existing open-source deep research agent systems predominantly focus on enhancing information seeking capabilities of web agents to locate specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information aggregation, which would limit their ability to generate coherent insights or support in-depth research. We propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training data for web agents. The process begins with proactive online exploration, where an agent sources grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence, the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize verifiable QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, dataset of 10K samples across 50K websites and 11 domains.

OmniVinci, an open-source omni-modal LLM, enhances cross-modal understanding and performance across audio, vision, and robotics applications with innovative architecture and efficient data curation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation. For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii) Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model, OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

MorphoBench is a benchmark that evaluates large models' reasoning capabilities using multidisciplinary questions, adaptive difficulty, and simulation-generated questions.  					AI-generated summary 				 With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5. MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

Skyfall-GS creates large-scale, high-quality 3D urban scenes using satellite imagery and diffusion models, offering real-time exploration and improved geometry and texture consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality close-up appearances. We propose Skyfall-GS, the first city-block scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

"Skyfall-GS creates large-scale, high-quality 3D urban scenes using satellite imagery and diffusion models, offering real-time exploration and improved geometry and texture consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality close-up appearances. We propose Skyfall-GS, the first city-block scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

LightsOut enhances Single Image Flare Removal by reconstructing off-frame light sources using a diffusion-based outpainting framework, improving performance across challenging scenarios.  					AI-generated summary 				 Lens flare significantly degrades image quality, impacting critical computer vision tasks like object detection and autonomous driving. Recent Single Image Flare Removal (SIFR) methods perform poorly when off-frame light sources are incomplete or absent. We propose LightsOut, a diffusion-based outpainting framework tailored to enhance SIFR by reconstructing off-frame light sources. Our method leverages a multitask regression module and LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model to ensure realistic and physically consistent outpainting results. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LightsOut consistently boosts the performance of existing SIFR methods across challenging scenarios without additional retraining, serving as a universally applicable plug-and-play preprocessing solution.

BLIP3o-NEXT, a unified text-to-image generation and image editing model, uses an Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture to achieve superior performance and realism.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3 series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model, we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism. Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

A vision-guided 3D layout generation system uses an image generation model and scene graphs to produce rich and coherent 3D scenes from prompts.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/HiHiAllen/Imaginarium.

"A vision-guided 3D layout generation system uses an image generation model and scene graphs to produce rich and coherent 3D scenes from prompts.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/HiHiAllen/Imaginarium."

A new paradigm, Explore to Evolve, is proposed to enhance web agents' information aggregation by constructing a large dataset and developing foundation models that outperform existing models on a challenging benchmark.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly, they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence, the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents, we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves 28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

Paper2Web is a benchmark and evaluation framework for academic webpage generation, featuring PWAgent, an autonomous pipeline that enhances content and layout through MCP tools, outperforming end-to-end baselines.  					AI-generated summary 				 Academic project websites can more effectively disseminate research when they clearly present core content and enable intuitive navigation and interaction. However, current approaches such as direct Large Language Model (LLM) generation, templates, or direct HTML conversion struggle to produce layout-aware, interactive sites, and a comprehensive evaluation suite for this task has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce Paper2Web, a benchmark dataset and multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing academic webpage generation. It incorporates rule-based metrics like Connectivity, Completeness and human-verified LLM-as-a-Judge (covering interactivity, aesthetics, and informativeness), and PaperQuiz, which measures paper-level knowledge retention. We further present PWAgent, an autonomous pipeline that converts scientific papers into interactive and multimedia-rich academic homepages. The agent iteratively refines both content and layout through MCP tools that enhance emphasis, balance, and presentation quality. Our experiments show that PWAgent consistently outperforms end-to-end baselines like template-based webpages and arXiv/alphaXiv versions by a large margin while maintaining low cost, achieving the Pareto-front in academic webpage generation.
