Towards Autonomous Legal Agents in Venture Capital Pierre Colombo, Malik Boudiaf, Allyn Sweet, Michael Desa, Hongxi Wang, Kevin Candra, Symeon del Marmol {firstname}@equall.com Before closing venture capital financing rounds, lawyers conduct diligence that includes tying out the capitalization table: verifying that every security (e.g., shares, options, warrants) and issuance term (e.g., vesting schedules, acceleration triggers, transfer restrictions) is supported by large sets of underlying legal documentation. While LLMs continue to improve on legal benchmarks, specialized legal workflows, such as capitalization tie-out, remain out of reach even for strong agentic systems: the task requires multi-document reasoning, strict evidence traceability, and deterministic outputs that current approaches fail to reliably deliver. We characterize capitalization tie-out as an instance of real-world benchmark for legal AI, analyze and compare the performance of existing agentic systems, and propose world model architecture towards tie-out automationand more broadly as foundation for applied legal intelligence. *Equal contributions Verifying legal ownership of company is bottleneck in private market transactions, from venture financings to M&A deals. Before deal closes, lawyers must manually reconcile thousands of pages against ownership records, process commonly referred to as cap table tie-out or capitalization due diligence. This work is critical to confirm financial allocations up to and arising from the transaction, while also tedious, error-prone, and typically performed under capped fees that compress margins. Large language models have shown impressive capabilities on legal reasoning benchmarks [7, 5, 6, 11, 10] and contract analysis tasks [14, 1], yet this recurring verification workflow remains categorically manual.

Text:"MatSpray: Fusing 2D Material World Knowledge on 3D Geometry Philipp Langsteiner philipp.langsteiner@uni-tuebingen.de Jan-Niklas Dihlmann jan-niklas.dihlmann@uni-tuebingen.de Hendrik Lensch hendrik.lensch@uni-tuebingen.de 5 2 0 2 0 ] . [ 1 4 1 3 8 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r Figure 1. MatSpray Overview we utilize 2D material world knowlegde from 2D diffusion models to reconstruct 3D relightable objects. Given multi-view images of target object, we first generate per-view PBR material predictions (base color, roughness, metallic) using any 2D diffusion-based material model. These 2D estimates are then integrated into 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction via Gaussian ray tracing. Finally, neural refinement stage applies softmax-based restriction to enforce multi-view consistency and enhance the physical accuracy of the materials. The resulting 3D assets feature high-quality, fully relightable PBR materials under novel illumination. Project page: https://matspray.jdihlmann.com/ "

Capitalization tie-out in legal diligence is a complex task that current agentic systems struggle to automate due to its multi-document reasoning and evidence traceability requirements.  					AI-generated summary 				 Before closing venture capital financing rounds, lawyers conduct diligence that includes tying out the capitalization table: verifying that every security (for example, shares, options, warrants) and issuance term (for example, vesting schedules, acceleration triggers, transfer restrictions) is supported by large sets of underlying legal documentation. While LLMs continue to improve on legal benchmarks, specialized legal workflows, such as capitalization tie-out, remain out of reach even for strong agentic systems. The task requires multi-document reasoning, strict evidence traceability, and deterministic outputs that current approaches fail to reliably deliver. We characterize capitalization tie-out as an instance of a real-world benchmark for legal AI, analyze and compare the performance of existing agentic systems, and propose a world model architecture toward tie-out automation-and more broadly as a foundation for applied legal intelligence.

**Justification:**

- **REASONING**: The paper explicitly discusses "multi-document reasoning" as a core requirement for the capitalization tie-out task, and proposes methods to enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of AI systems to handle complex legal workflows.

- **SCIENCE**: The paper applies language models to a specialized domain (legal/scientific research automation) and discusses understanding and automating complex professional workflows, which falls under scientific applications of LMs.

The proposed framework integrates 2D material maps into 3D geometry using diffusion models and Gaussian Splatting, enhancing relighting and photorealism in reconstructed scenes.  					AI-generated summary 				 Manual modeling of material parameters and 3D geometry is a time consuming yet essential task in the gaming and film industries. While recent advances in 3D reconstruction have enabled accurate approximations of scene geometry and appearance, these methods often fall short in relighting scenarios due to the lack of precise, spatially varying material parameters. At the same time, diffusion models operating on 2D images have shown strong performance in predicting physically based rendering (PBR) properties such as albedo, roughness, and metallicity. However, transferring these 2D material maps onto reconstructed 3D geometry remains a significant challenge. We propose a framework for fusing 2D material data into 3D geometry using a combination of novel learning-based and projection-based approaches. We begin by reconstructing scene geometry via Gaussian Splatting. From the input images, a diffusion model generates 2D maps for albedo, roughness, and metallic parameters. Any existing diffusion model that can convert images or videos to PBR materials can be applied. The predictions are further integrated into the 3D representation either by optimizing an image-based loss or by directly projecting the material parameters onto the Gaussians using Gaussian ray tracing. To enhance fine-scale accuracy and multi-view consistency, we further introduce a light-weight neural refinement step (Neural Merger), which takes ray-traced material features as input and produces detailed adjustments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing techniques in both quantitative metrics and perceived visual realism. This enables more accurate, relightable, and photorealistic renderings from reconstructed scenes, significantly improving the realism and efficiency of asset creation workflows in content production pipelines.
