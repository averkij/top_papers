LoPA, a training-free algorithm, enhances the parallelism of diffusion large language models, doubling the tokens per forward pass and boosting throughput with multi-GPU deployment.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for high-speed inference. However, current confidence-driven decoding strategies are constrained by limited parallelism, typically achieving only 1--3 tokens per forward pass (TPF). In this work, we identify that the degree of parallelism during dLLM inference is highly sensitive to the Token Filling Order (TFO). Then, we introduce Lookahead PArallel Decoding LoPA, a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm, to identify a superior TFO and hence accelerate inference. LoPA concurrently explores distinct candidate TFOs via parallel branches, and selects the one with the highest potential for future parallelism based on branch confidence. We apply LoPA to the state-of-the-art D2F model and observe a substantial enhancement in decoding efficiency. Notably, LoPA increases the TPF of D2F-Dream to 10.1 on the GSM8K while maintaining performance superior to the Dream baseline. Furthermore, to facilitate this unprecedented degree of parallelism, we develop a specialized multi-device inference system featuring Branch Parallelism (BP), which achieves a single-sample throughput of 1073.9 tokens per second under multi-GPU deployment. The code is available at https://github.com/zhijie-group/LoPA.

Алгоритм параллельно исследует различные кандидаты на оптимальный порядок через ветвления и выбирает наиболее перспективный на основе уверенности модели. Результаты показывают впечатляющий рост — удвоение токенов за один проход (до 10.1 на GSM8K) и пропускную способность 1073.9 токенов в секунду при развертывании на нескольких GPU.",
