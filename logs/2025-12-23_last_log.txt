Veracodes 2025 GenAI Code Security Report analyzed code from leading AI assistants and found nearly half of securityrelevant implementations contained Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) vulnerabilities. This represents systematic risk in AI-assisted development, compounding security debt across millions of developers. The risk surface has scaled with adoption. The issue goes beyond individual bugs. AI-generated vulnerabilities enter production codebases silently, without the traditional code review scrutiny applied to human-written code. Developers trust AI assistants to produce functional implementations, but these tools lack security context to recognize when functional means exploitable. Apiiro (2025) found AI copilots introduced 322% more privilege escalation paths 1 and 153% more architectural design flaws compared to manually-written code, while generating 10 more security findings overallactively degrading security practices [2]. This creates multiplier effect. Vulnerable patterns suggested by AI assistants propagate across multiple projects. SQL injection flaws spread through microservices architectures. Authentication bypasses replicate across API endpoints. Cryptographic failures multiply through mobile applications. The scale of AI adoption makes this systematic risk to software security. LLMs trained on public code repositories learn from millions of vulnerable examples. Stack Overflow answers from 2010 showing insecure MySQL queries. GitHub repositories implementing broken authentication. Tutorial code demonstrating SQL injection vulnerabilities as simple examples. These models learn what code looks like, not what secure code requires.Existing secure coding datasets have significant limitations for training security-aware language models. We analyzed four widely-used datasets: CWE-Sans (372 examples), Juliet Test Suite (81,000-86,000 synthetic test cases for C/C++ and Java), SARD (170,000-200,000 test programs), and Draper VDISC (1.27 million examples). While these serve their intended purposes, they have critical gaps for LLM training. Scale versus quality. Juliet provides 81,000-86,000 test cases designed for testing static analysis tools, but lacks connections to real-world incidents. These synthetic test cases demonstrate CWE patterns in isolation, teaching models to recognize textbook vulnerabilities that dont reflect how attacks occur in production. SARD offers 170,000-200,000 test programs but fewer than 5% reference documented security incidents. Synthetic training data misses the contextual factors that make vulnerabilities exploitable in production. Incident grounding is rare. Our manual audit of CWE-Sans metadata (n=372 examples, 100% coverage) found approximately 18% reference actual CVEs or documented breachesfewer than one in five. The rest are synthetic demonstrations lacking the production context needed to understand exploitation. Realworld attacks exploit edge cases, framework-specific behaviors, and integration failures that rarely appear in manufactured examples. Format limitations. Existing datasets use code-only formatsvulnerable snippet paired with secure snippet. This doesnt capture how developers actually interact with AI assistants. Real development conversations escalate through multiple turns as developers ask about functionality, then scaling, performance, and edge cases. AI assistants must maintain security context throughout this workflow, but existing datasets dont model these multi-turn interactions. No operational guidance. Existing datasets provide vulnerable and patched code without detection mechanisms, logging strategies, or defense-in-depth guidance. For production systems, secure code is just one component of comprehensive security. Organizations need detection rules, monitoring strategies, incident response procedures, and graceful degradation when primary controls fail."

Over++, a video effect generation framework, synthesizes realistic environmental effects conditioned on text prompts while preserving the original video scene without requiring camera pose or dense annotations.  					AI-generated summary 				 In professional video compositing workflows, artists must manually create environmental interactions-such as shadows, reflections, dust, and splashes-between foreground subjects and background layers. Existing video generative models struggle to preserve the input video while adding such effects, and current video inpainting methods either require costly per-frame masks or yield implausible results. We introduce augmented compositing, a new task that synthesizes realistic, semi-transparent environmental effects conditioned on text prompts and input video layers, while preserving the original scene. To address this task, we present Over++, a video effect generation framework that makes no assumptions about camera pose, scene stationarity, or depth supervision. We construct a paired effect dataset tailored for this task and introduce an unpaired augmentation strategy that preserves text-driven editability. Our method also supports optional mask control and keyframe guidance without requiring dense annotations. Despite training on limited data, Over++ produces diverse and realistic environmental effects and outperforms existing baselines in both effect generation and scene preservation.

SecureCode v2.0 is a comprehensive dataset providing security-focused coding examples grounded in real incidents, with vulnerable and secure implementations, attacks, defense guidance, and operational security context across multiple languages.  					AI-generated summary 				 AI assistants produce vulnerable code in 45% of security-relevant scenarios, introducing flaws into production systems at scale. Yet existing secure coding datasets fall short. They lack incident grounding, don't provide the scale modern training requires, and miss the operational security context developers need for production deployments. We present SecureCode v2.0, a production-grade dataset of 1,215 security-focused coding examples that passed structural validation and expert security review. Every example ties to actual documented security incidents with CVE references, provides vulnerable and secure implementations, demonstrates concrete attacks, and includes defense-in-depth operational guidance. The dataset covers 11 vulnerability categories (complete OWASP Top 10:2025 plus AI/ML Security Threats) across 11 languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, PHP, C#, TypeScript, Ruby, Rust, Kotlin, and YAML for infrastructure-as-code).   Our quality assurance framework ensures complete incident grounding. Each example includes SIEM integration strategies, infrastructure hardening recommendations (Docker, AppArmor, WAF configurations), and testing approaches using language-appropriate frameworks. The dataset uses a 4-turn conversational structure mirroring actual developer-AI interactions, escalating from basic implementations to advanced security considerations and defense-in-depth guidance.   Our contributions: (1) 1,215 rigorously validated examples split into 989 training, 122 validation, and 104 test sets, (2) an automated validation framework ensuring dataset consistency, (3) a 4-turn conversational structure capturing realistic security workflows, (4) comprehensive operational security guidance with SIEM integration strategies, (5) complete language-specific implementation fidelity, and (6) open-source release of data, validation tools, and benchmarking protocols.

"SecureCode v2.0 is a comprehensive dataset providing security-focused coding examples grounded in real incidents, with vulnerable and secure implementations, attacks, defense guidance, and operational security context across multiple languages.  					AI-generated summary 				 AI assistants produce vulnerable code in 45% of security-relevant scenarios, introducing flaws into production systems at scale. Yet existing secure coding datasets fall short. They lack incident grounding, don't provide the scale modern training requires, and miss the operational security context developers need for production deployments. We present SecureCode v2.0, a production-grade dataset of 1,215 security-focused coding examples that passed structural validation and expert security review. Every example ties to actual documented security incidents with CVE references, provides vulnerable and secure implementations, demonstrates concrete attacks, and includes defense-in-depth operational guidance. The dataset covers 11 vulnerability categories (complete OWASP Top 10:2025 plus AI/ML Security Threats) across 11 languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, PHP, C#, TypeScript, Ruby, Rust, Kotlin, and YAML for infrastructure-as-code).   Our quality assurance framework ensures complete incident grounding. Each example includes SIEM integration strategies, infrastructure hardening recommendations (Docker, AppArmor, WAF configurations), and testing approaches using language-appropriate frameworks. The dataset uses a 4-turn conversational structure mirroring actual developer-AI interactions, escalating from basic implementations to advanced security considerations and defense-in-depth guidance.   Our contributions: (1) 1,215 rigorously validated examples split into 989 training, 122 validation, and 104 test sets, (2) an automated validation framework ensuring dataset consistency, (3) a 4-turn conversational structure capturing realistic security workflows, (4) comprehensive operational security guidance with SIEM integration strategies, (5) complete language-specific implementation fidelity, and (6) open-source release of data, validation tools, and benchmarking protocols."
