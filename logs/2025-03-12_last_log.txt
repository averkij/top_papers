Index TermsBenchmark, Code Generation, AI4SE, Large Language Models, Search I. INTRODUCTIONfor assessing artificial intelligence-driven software engineering (AI4SE) techniques. They provide standardized performance metrics, facilitate reproducibility, and guide innovation. However, the exponential growth in benchmark development has introduced significant challenges: researchers must navigate an increasingly fragmented landscape to identify benchmarks that align well with their specific objectives. This complexity often incentivizes reliance on popular or widely-adopted benchmarks without scrutinizing their applicability, inherent limitations, or potential flaws. Such practices risk propagating biases, overestimating technical progress, and misdirecting research priorities. notable example of benchmark limitations in code generation evaluation is HumanEval [1], widely-used dataset that has been used for assessing large language models (LLMs) R. Koohestani, P. de Bekker, and M. Izadi are with the Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands. (e-mail: rkoohestani@tudelft.nl; research@philippedebekker.com; m.izadi@tudelft.nl). R. Koohestanis ORCID: 0009-0000-1649-9596, M. Izadis ORCID: 00000001-5093-5523. such as Codex [1], Gemini [2], and GPT-4 [3]. HumanEval was downloaded 97, 444 times in February 2025 on single platform (Hugging Face) 1. This high number demonstrates the strong and sustained interest in this benchmark. Despite its broad adoption, HumanEval contains numerous flaws and inconsistencies [4]. For instance, Task 47, which requires computing the median of numerical list, incorrectly states the median of the list [-10,4,6,1000,10,20] is 15. When queried on this task, ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo reproduced the same incorrect result (see Figure 1). This suggests potential data contamination and benchmark overfitting which can artificially inflate performance scores. As HumanEval remains widely-used benchmark in both AI and software engineering communities, several efforts have sought to expand its language support [5], [6], [7], [8] or improve test coverage [9], [10]. However, these extensions often build upon the original dataset without addressing its fundamental deficiencies, allowing inherent issuessuch as flawed canonical solutions, vague problem definitions, incorrect tests, and insufficient coverageto persist. Moreover, LLM-augmented improvements, such as automatic translation, often lack rigorous quality control as well. Lastly, as models have advanced, HumanEval and similar popular benchmarks have become increasingly saturated, with close to 100% scores for recent models. 2 This necessitates continuous elevation of the complexity of programs to better reflect the capabilities of contemporary models. With this study we aim to address four key challenges in benchmarking: (1) the fragmentation of benchmark knowledge across tasks, (2) the difficulty of selecting contextually relevant benchmarks, (3) the lack of standardized approaches for benchmark creation and refinement, and (4) existing inherent flaws that limit benchmark utility. To tackle these issues, we systematically map the current benchmark landscape to facilitate informed selection and establish unified guidelines for developing robust and adaptable benchmarks. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through case study on the highly-popular benchmark, HumanEval. More specifically, we first conducted systematic review of benchmarking efforts in AI4SE from 2014 onward and identified 204 benchmarks from 173 studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of AI4SE benchmarks. We then extracted given benchmarks key metadata, including objectives, category, programming language, natural language, and relevant tasks, to structure 1https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/openai humaneval 2https://paperswithcode.com/sota/code-generation-on-humaneval 2 reviewed benchmark, HumanEvalNext (section V). We assessed ten recent LLMs on this benchmark and verified significant drops in performance compared to the original HumanEval[1] and the enhanced version, HumanEvalPlus [10], We publicly share our data and details of the user study in our replication package. 4 II. RESEARCH QUESTIONS We propose set of research questions (RQ) to guide our study, as presented below. RQ1: What is the current landscape of AI4SE benchmarks? 1) What are the existing benchmarks used in the field of AI4SE? 2) What are the key limitations and shortcomings of commonly used benchmarks? RQ2: How can we effectively process the growing number of benchmarks and extract meaningful insights? 1) How can we design tool to efficiently parse this dense data and make it "

Humans are undoubtedly the most important participants in computer vision, and the ability to detect any individual given a natural language description, a task we define as referring to any person, holds substantial practical value. However, we find that existing models generally fail to achieve real-world usability, and current benchmarks are limited by their focus on one-to-one referring, that hinder progress in this area. In this work, we revisit this task from three critical perspectives: task definition, dataset design, and model architecture. We first identify five aspects of referable entities and three distinctive characteristics of this task. Next, we introduce HumanRef, a novel dataset designed to tackle these challenges and better reflect real-world applications. From a model design perspective, we integrate a multimodal large language model with an object detection framework, constructing a robust referring model named RexSeek. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art models, which perform well on commonly used benchmarks like RefCOCO/+/g, struggle with HumanRef due to their inability to detect multiple individuals. In contrast, RexSeek not only excels in human referring but also generalizes effectively to common object referring, making it broadly applicable across various perception tasks.

The authors highlight that existing models often fall short in real-world scenarios and current benchmarks are too narrow, focusing mainly on one-to-one referring. They propose a new dataset called HumanRef, which is designed to better represent the complexities of real-world applications. Additionally, they introduce a new model, RexSeek, which combines a multimodal large language model with an object detection framework, showing improved performance in both human and object referring tasks.', title='Revolutionizing Person Detection with HumanRef and RexSeek'))

Benchmarks are essential for consistent evaluation and reproducibility. The integration of Artificial Intelligence into Software Engineering (AI4SE) has given rise to numerous benchmarks for tasks such as code generation and bug fixing. However, this surge presents challenges: (1) scattered benchmark knowledge across tasks, (2) difficulty in selecting relevant benchmarks, (3) the absence of a uniform standard for benchmark development, and (4) limitations of existing benchmarks. In this paper, we review 173 studies and identify 204 AI4SE benchmarks. We classify these benchmarks, analyze their limitations, and expose gaps in practices. Based on our review, we created BenchScout, a semantic search tool to find relevant benchmarks, using automated clustering of the contexts from associated studies. We conducted a user study with 22 participants to evaluate BenchScout's usability, effectiveness, and intuitiveness which resulted in average scores of 4.5, 4.0, and 4.1 out of 5. To advance benchmarking standards, we propose BenchFrame, a unified method to enhance benchmark quality. As a case study, we applied BenchFrame to the HumanEval benchmark and addressed its main limitations. This led to <PRE_TAG>HumanEvalNext</POST_TAG>, featuring (1) corrected errors, (2) improved language conversion, (3) expanded test coverage, and (4) increased difficulty. We then evaluated ten state-of-the-art code language models on HumanEval, HumanEvalPlus, and <PRE_TAG>HumanEvalNext</POST_TAG>. On <PRE_TAG>HumanEvalNext</POST_TAG>, models showed a pass@1 score reduction of 31.22% and 19.94% compared to HumanEval and HumanEvalPlus, respectively.
