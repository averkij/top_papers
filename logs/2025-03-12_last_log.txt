Text:"PhiloBERTA: Transformer-Based Cross-Lingual Analysis of Greek and Latin Lexicons 5 2 0 2 7 ] . [ 1 5 6 2 5 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r Rumi A. Allbert rumi.allbert@wolframinstitute.org Wolfram Institute Makai L. Allbert makai.allbert@ralston.ac Ralston College Abstract We present PhiloBERTA, cross-lingual transformer model that measures semantic relationships between ancient Greek and Latin lexicons. Through analysis of selected term pairs from classical texts, we use contextual embeddings and angular similarity metrics to identify precise semantic alignments. Our results show that etymologically related pairs demonstrate significantly higher similarity scores, particularly for abstract philosophical concepts such as ἐπιστήμη (scientia) and δικαιοσύνη (iustitia). Statistical analysis reveals consistent patterns in these relationships (p = 0.012), with etymologically related pairs displaying remarkable semantic preservation compared to control pairs. These findings establish quantitative framework for examining how philosophical concepts progressed between Greek and Latin traditions, offering new method for classical philological research. Diachronic and cross-lingual semantic studies play an important role in understanding linguistic and conceptual evolution across time and cultures. In the domain of classical languages, such as Ancient Greek and Latin, this type of analysis is particularly valuable for examining complex historical texts, including philosophical writings. Philosophical terms in Ancient Greece often carried specialized meanings that evolved through centuries of theological and philosophical discourse. These texts shaped intellectual traditions for millennia, yet studying their nuanced semantic shifts and cross-lingual relationships presents unique computational challenges. core difficulty lies in handling three fundamental complexities: 1) scarce parallel corpora for classical languages, 2) polysemy influenced by genre-specific usage, and 3) diachronic semantic "

We present PhiloBERTA, a cross-lingual transformer model that measures semantic relationships between ancient Greek and Latin lexicons. Through analysis of selected term pairs from classical texts, we use contextual embeddings and angular similarity metrics to identify precise semantic alignments. Our results show that etymologically related pairs demonstrate significantly higher similarity scores, particularly for abstract philosophical concepts such as epist\=em\=e (scientia) and dikaiosyn\=e (iustitia). Statistical analysis reveals consistent patterns in these relationships (p = 0.012), with etymologically related pairs showing remarkably stable semantic preservation compared to control pairs. These findings establish a quantitative framework for examining how philosophical concepts moved between Greek and Latin traditions, offering new methods for classical philological research.
