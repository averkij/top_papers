[ 1 9 3 6 7 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r aNeurons in large language models often exhibit polysemanticity, simultaneously encoding multiple unrelated concepts and obscuring interpretability. Instead of relying on post-hoc methods, we present MoE-X, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model designed to be intrinsically interpretable. Our approach is motivated by the observation that, in language models, wider networks with sparse activations are more likely to capture interpretable factors. However, directly training such large sparse networks is computationally prohibitive. MoE architectures offer scalable alternative by activating only subset of experts for any given input, inherently aligning with interpretability objectives. In MoE-X, we establish this connection by rewriting the MoE layer as an equivalent sparse, large MLP. This approach enables efficient scaling of the hidden size while maintaining sparsity. To further enhance interpretability, we enforce sparse activation within each expert and redesign the routing mechanism to prioritize experts with the highest activation sparsity. These designs ensure that only the most salient features are routed and processed by the experts. We evaluate MoE-X on chess and natural language tasks, showing that it achieves performance comparable to dense models while significantly improving interpretability. MoE-X achieves perplexity better than GPT-2, with interpretability surpassing even sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based approaches. 1. Introduction Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Waswani et al., 2017) have achieved remarkable progress. However, their internal workings remain poorly understood. This lack of understanding often leads to unexpected and potentially harmful 1University of Oxford 2National University of Singapore. Preprint Figure 1. MoE-X introduces sparse and wide network architecture designed for interpretability. Compared to dense MLPs, it incorporates both sparsity and wider structure. Unlike traditional MoE models, it enforces sparsity within each expert and routes tokens to the sparsest experts. behaviors (Hendrycks et al., 2023; Ngo et al., 2022), posing risks in their deployment. To address this, mechanistic interpretability (Elhage et al., 2022c) seeks to uncover how these models process information and reduce potential risks. central obstacle to mechanistic interpretability is polysemanticity, where individual neurons encode multiple, unrelated concepts (Olah et al., 2020). Specifically, we refer to the hidden neurons from the multi-layer perceptron (MLPs) in Transformers. Such polysemantic neurons lack clear, singular roles, making it difficult to identify disentangled features or factors in neural networks. common strategy to address this issue is to decompose entangled neuron activity into interpretable vectors using posthoc methods like Sparse Auto-Encoders (SAEs) (Huben et al., 2023). However, these approaches are computationally expensive (Gao et al., 2024; Lieberum et al., 2024), require additional analysis after training, and often do not explain all the features of the model (Menon et al., 2024). Instead, we advocate for designing interpretability directly into the model architecture in which the resultant discourages polysemanticity during training. While some works explore architectural changes for interpretability, they often focus on toy-scale tasks (Pearce et al., 2024; Agarwal et al., 2021; Sharkey, 2023; Jermyn et al., 2022) or compromise Mixture of Experts Made Intrinsically Interpretable performance (Elhage et al., 2022a). To achieve built-in interpretability, as shown in Figure 1, we identify two key factors that influence it, (1) increasing the size of the MLP layers, i.e., number of hidden activations, and (2) increasing the sparsity of these activations. That is to say, making the MLP layers in transformer wider and sparser should encourage more disentangled internal representations. To test this beyond toy experiments (Jermyn et al., 2022; Elhage et al., 2022b), we conduct experiments on GPT-2-like (Radford et al., 2019) models on chess gameplay data (Karvonen et al., 2024). Chess provides an excellent natural ground truth for interpretability because the board state can be used as reference for understanding how each neuron represents and predicts chess moves. Our experiments show that sufficiently wide-and-sparse MLP in transformer indeed yields more interpretable neurons, leading to 25% increase in F1 score for chess move prediction, supporting our hypothesis. Motivated by these findings, we propose to leverage mixtureof-experts (MoE) architectures (Fedus et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2017) as natural fit for intrinsic interpretability. While different from standard MLP, MoE can be rewritten as wide and sparse MLP, whose neurons are each experts neuron weighted by the sparse gating scores. This structure allows MoE to increase the width while maintaining controlled sparsity, leading to inherently interpretable models. Yet, typical MoE models are not perfect for interpretability. First, each expert is still dense MLP, which can suffer from polysemanticity. Second, standard top-k routing (Fedus et al., 2022) primarily targets performance rather than expert sparsity. As result, the gating decisions made by the routing mechanism are often misaligned with the goals of interpretability. To bridge this gap and align MoE with interpretability, we propose MoE-X, which includes two key designs: ReLU Experts. We use ReLU activation within each expert. This simple yet effective modification promotes intrinsic activation sparsity in the expert (Awasthi et al., 2024), which in turn helps to disentangle the feature representations. Sparsity-Aware Routing. We introduce gating function that predicts which experts would produce the most sparse activations. To avoid expensive computations, we develop method to estimate each experts sparsity without explicitly computing all activations. This ensures that the sparsest experts are chosen during inference, promoting disentangled representations. Together, these modifications enable MoE-X to maintain competitive performance while providing more transparent, semantically meaningful internal representations. Our experiments on chess and language tasks confirm that MoE-X matches or exc"

How do two individuals differ when performing the same action? In this work, we introduce Video Action Differencing (VidDiff), the novel task of identifying subtle differences between videos of the same action, which has many applications, such as coaching and skill learning. To enable development on this new task, we first create VidDiffBench, a benchmark dataset containing 549 video pairs, with human annotations of 4,469 fine-grained action differences and 2,075 localization timestamps indicating where these differences occur. Our experiments demonstrate that VidDiffBench poses a significant challenge for state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs), such as GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. By analyzing failure cases of LMMs on VidDiffBench, we highlight two key challenges for this task: localizing relevant sub-actions over two videos and fine-grained frame comparison. To overcome these, we propose the VidDiff method, an agentic workflow that breaks the task into three stages: action difference proposal, keyframe localization, and frame differencing, each stage utilizing specialized foundation models. To encourage future research in this new task, we release the benchmark at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jmhb/VidDiffBench and code at http://jmhb0.github.io/viddiff.

Training models to effectively use test-time compute is crucial for improving the reasoning performance of LLMs. Current methods mostly do so via fine-tuning on search traces or running RL with 0/1 outcome reward, but do these approaches efficiently utilize test-time compute? Would these approaches continue to scale as the budget improves? In this paper, we try to answer these questions. We formalize the problem of optimizing test-time compute as a meta-reinforcement learning (RL) problem, which provides a principled perspective on spending test-time compute. This perspective enables us to view the long output stream from the LLM as consisting of several episodes run at test time and leads us to use a notion of cumulative regret over output tokens as a way to measure the efficacy of test-time compute. Akin to how RL algorithms can best tradeoff exploration and exploitation over training, minimizing cumulative regret would also provide the best balance between exploration and exploitation in the token stream.

"Training models to effectively use test-time compute is crucial for improving the reasoning performance of LLMs. Current methods mostly do so via fine-tuning on search traces or running RL with 0/1 outcome reward, but do these approaches efficiently utilize test-time compute? Would these approaches continue to scale as the budget improves? In this paper, we try to answer these questions. We formalize the problem of optimizing test-time compute as a meta-reinforcement learning (RL) problem, which provides a principled perspective on spending test-time compute. This perspective enables us to view the long output stream from the LLM as consisting of several episodes run at test time and leads us to use a notion of cumulative regret over output tokens as a way to measure the efficacy of test-time compute. Akin to how RL algorithms can best tradeoff exploration and exploitation over training, minimizing cumulative regret would also provide the best balance between exploration and exploitation in the token stream. While we show that state-of-the-art models do not minimize regret, one can do so by maximizing a dense reward bonus in conjunction with the outcome 0/1 reward RL.

Neurons in large language models often exhibit polysemanticity, simultaneously encoding multiple unrelated concepts and obscuring interpretability. Instead of relying on post-hoc methods, we present MoE-X, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model designed to be intrinsically interpretable. Our approach is motivated by the observation that, in language models, wider networks with <PRE_TAG>sparse activations</POST_TAG> are more likely to capture interpretable factors. However, directly training such large sparse networks is computationally prohibitive. MoE architectures offer a scalable alternative by activating only a subset of experts for any given input, inherently aligning with interpretability objectives. In MoE-X, we establish this connection by rewriting the MoE layer as an equivalent sparse, large MLP. This approach enables efficient scaling of the hidden size while maintaining sparsity. To further enhance interpretability, we enforce sparse activation within each expert and redesign the routing mechanism to prioritize experts with the highest activation sparsity. These designs ensure that only the most salient features are routed and processed by the experts. We evaluate MoE-X on chess and natural language tasks, showing that it achieves performance comparable to dense models while significantly improving interpretability. MoE-X achieves a perplexity better than GPT-2, with interpretability surpassing even sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based approaches.

While recent advancements in text-to-video diffusion models enable high-quality short video generation from a single prompt, generating real-world long videos in a single pass remains challenging due to limited data and high computational costs. To address this, several works propose tuning-free approaches, i.e., extending existing models for long video generation, specifically using multiple prompts to allow for dynamic and controlled content changes. However, these methods primarily focus on ensuring smooth transitions between adjacent frames, often leading to content drift and a gradual loss of semantic coherence over longer sequences. To tackle such an issue, we propose Synchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS), a novel inference framework that synchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range consistency across both adjacent and distant frames. Our approach combines two complementary sampling strategies: reverse and optimization-based sampling, which ensure seamless local transitions and enforce global coherence, respectively. However, directly alternating between these samplings misaligns denoising trajectories, disrupting prompt guidance and introducing unintended content changes as they operate independently. To resolve this, SynCoS synchronizes them through a grounded timestep and a fixed baseline noise, ensuring fully coupled sampling with aligned denoising paths. Extensive experiments show that SynCoS significantly improves multi-event long video generation, achieving smoother transitions and superior long-range coherence, outperforming previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.
