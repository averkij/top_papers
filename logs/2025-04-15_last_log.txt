Text:"3D CoCa: Contrastive Learners are 3D Captioners Ting Huang1 Zeyu Zhang2 Yemin Wang3 Hao Tang4 1Shanghai University of Engineering Science 2The Australian National University 3Xiamen University 4Peking University Equal contribution. Project lead. Corresponding author: bjdxtanghao@gmail.com. 5 2 0 A 3 1 ] . [ 1 8 1 5 9 0 . 4 0 5 2 : r Abstract 3D captioning, which aims to describe the content of 3D scenes in natural language, remains highly challenging due to the inherent sparsity of point clouds and weak cross-modal alignment in existing methods. To address these challenges, we propose 3D CoCa, novel unified framework that seamlessly combines contrastive visionlanguage learning with 3D caption generation in single architecture. Our approach leverages frozen CLIP vision-language backbone to provide rich semantic priors, spatially-aware 3D scene encoder to capture geometric context, and multi-modal decoder to generate descriptive captions. Unlike prior two-stage methods that rely on explicit object proposals, 3D CoCa jointly optimizes contrastive and captioning objectives in shared feature space, eliminating the need for external detectors or handcrafted proposals. This joint training paradigm yields stronger spatial reasoning and richer semantic grounding by aligning 3D and textual representations. Extensive experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that 3D CoCa significantly outperforms current stateof-the-arts by 10.2% and 5.76% in CIDEr@0.5IoU, respectively.

Text:"DiffuMural: Restoring Dunhuang Murals with Multi-scale Diffusion Puyu Han1 Jiaju Kang2 Yuhang Pan3 Erting Pan4 Zeyu Zhang5 Juntao Jiang7 Zhichen Liu1 Luqi Gong8 Qunchao Jin6 5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 3 1 5 9 0 . 4 0 5 2 : r 1Southern University of Science and Technology 2Beijing Normal University 3Hebei Guoyan Science and Technology Center 4Wuhan University 5The Australian National University 6AI Geeks 7Zhejiang University 8Zhejiang Lab Abstract Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models have produced excellent results in the field of conditional image generation. However, restoration of ancient murals, as an important downstream task in this field, poses significant challenges to diffusion model-based restoration methods due to its large defective area and scarce training samples. Conditional restoration tasks are more concerned with whether the restored part meets the aesthetic standards of mural restoration in terms of overall style and seam detail, and such metrics for evaluating heuristic image complements are lacking in current research. We therefore propose DiffuMural, combined Multi-scale convergence and Collaborative Diffusion mechanism with ControlNet and cyclic consistency loss to optimise the matching between the generated images and the conditional control. DiffuMural demonstrates outstanding capabilities in mural restoration, leveraging training data from 23 large-scale Dunhuang murals that exhibit consistent visual aesthetics. The model excels in restoring intricate details, achieving coherent overall appearance, and addressing the unique challenges posed by incomplete murals lacking factual grounding. Our evaluation framework incorporates four key metrics to quantitatively assess incomplete murals: factual accuracy, textural detail, contextual semantics, and holistic visual coherence. Furthermore, we integrate humanistic value assessments to ensure the restored murals retain their cultural and artistic significance. Extensive experiments validate that our meth"

3D captioning, which aims to describe the content of 3D scenes in natural language, remains highly challenging due to the inherent sparsity of point clouds and weak cross-modal alignment in existing methods. To address these challenges, we propose 3D CoCa, a novel unified framework that seamlessly combines contrastive vision-language learning with 3D caption generation in a single architecture. Our approach leverages a frozen CLIP vision-language backbone to provide rich semantic priors, a spatially-aware 3D scene encoder to capture geometric context, and a multi-modal decoder to generate descriptive captions. Unlike prior two-stage methods that rely on explicit object proposals, 3D CoCa jointly optimizes contrastive and captioning objectives in a shared feature space, eliminating the need for external detectors or handcrafted proposals. This joint training paradigm yields stronger spatial reasoning and richer semantic grounding by aligning 3D and textual representations. Extensive experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that 3D CoCa significantly outperforms current state-of-the-arts by 10.2% and 5.76% in CIDEr at 0.5IoU, respectively. Code will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/3DCoCa.

Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models have produced excellent results in the field of conditional image generation. However, restoration of ancient murals, as an important downstream task in this field, poses significant challenges to diffusion model-based restoration methods due to its large defective area and scarce training samples. Conditional restoration tasks are more concerned with whether the restored part meets the aesthetic standards of mural restoration in terms of overall style and seam detail, and such metrics for evaluating heuristic image complements are lacking in current research. We therefore propose DiffuMural, a combined Multi-scale convergence and Collaborative Diffusion mechanism with ControlNet and cyclic consistency loss to optimise the matching between the generated images and the conditional control. DiffuMural demonstrates outstanding capabilities in mural restoration, leveraging training data from 23 large-scale Dunhuang murals that exhibit consistent visual aesthetics. The model excels in restoring intricate details, achieving a coherent overall appearance, and addressing the unique challenges posed by incomplete murals lacking factual grounding. Our evaluation framework incorporates four key metrics to quantitatively assess incomplete murals: factual accuracy, textural detail, contextual semantics, and holistic visual coherence. Furthermore, we integrate humanistic value assessments to ensure the restored murals retain their cultural and artistic significance. Extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

The model excels in restoring intricate details, achieving a coherent overall appearance, and addressing the unique challenges posed by incomplete murals lacking factual grounding. Our evaluation framework incorporates four key metrics to quantitatively assess incomplete murals: factual accuracy, textural detail, contextual semantics, and holistic visual coherence. Furthermore, we integrate humanistic value assessments to ensure the restored murals retain their cultural and artistic significance. Extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in both qualitative and quantitative metrics."

"Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models have produced excellent results in the field of conditional image generation. However, restoration of ancient murals, as an important downstream task in this field, poses significant challenges to diffusion model-based restoration methods due to its large defective area and scarce training samples. Conditional restoration tasks are more concerned with whether the restored part meets the aesthetic standards of mural restoration in terms of overall style and seam detail, and such metrics for evaluating heuristic image complements are lacking in current research. We therefore propose DiffuMural, a combined Multi-scale convergence and Collaborative Diffusion mechanism with ControlNet and cyclic consistency loss to optimise the matching between the generated images and the conditional control. DiffuMural demonstrates outstanding capabilities in mural restoration, leveraging training data from 23 large-scale Dunhuang murals that exhibit consistent visual aesthetics. The model excels in restoring intricate details, achieving a coherent overall appearance, and addressing the unique challenges posed by incomplete murals lacking factual grounding. Our evaluation framework incorporates four key metrics to quantitatively assess incomplete murals: factual accuracy, textural detail, contextual semantics, and holistic visual coherence. Furthermore, we integrate humanistic value assessments to ensure the restored murals retain their cultural and artistic significance. Extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in both qualitative and quantitative metrics."
