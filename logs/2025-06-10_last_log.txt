[ 1 9 0 3 7 0 . 6 0 5 2 : r ConfQA: Answer Only If You Are Confident Yin Huang1,, Yifan Ethan Xu1, Kai Sun1, Vera Yan1, Alicia Sun2, Haidar Khan1, Jimmy Nguyen1, Mohammad Kachuee1, Zhaojiang Lin1, Yue Liu1, Aaron Colak1, Anuj Kumar1, Wen-tau Yih2, Xin Luna Dong1 1Meta Reality Labs, 2FAIR at Meta Work done at Meta Can we teach Large Language Models (LLMs) to refrain from hallucinating factual statements? In this paper we present fine-tuning strategy that we call ConfQA, which can reduce hallucination rate from 20-40% to under 5% across multiple factuality benchmarks. The core idea is simple: when the LLM answers question correctly, it is trained to continue with the answer; otherwise, it is trained to admit "I am unsure". But there are two key factors that make the training highly effective. First, we introduce dampening prompt"answer only if you are confident"to explicitly guide the behavior, without which hallucination remains high as 15%-25%. Second, we leverage simple factual statements, specifically attribute values from knowledge graphs, to help LLMs calibrate the confidence, resulting in robust generalization across domains and question types. Building on this insight, we propose the Dual Neural Knowledge framework, which seamlessly select between internally parameterized neural knowledge and externally recorded symbolic knowledge based on ConfQAs confidence. The framework enables potential accuracy gains to beyond 95%, while reducing unnecessary external retrievals by over 30%. Date: June 2, 2025 Correspondence: Yin Huang at maggiehuang@meta.com Despite the remarkable capabilities that Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated, hallucination of factual statements remains challenge (Maynez et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021; Ji et al., 2023a). It has been broadly realized that factual information shall not be fabricated or generalized, instead shall be anchored in internally parameterized neural knowledge or externally recorded symbolic content"

ConfQA fine-tuning strategy reduces factual statement hallucination in LLMs by 80%, using a dampening prompt and factual statements from knowledge graphs to improve confidence calibration and knowledge selection.  					AI-generated summary 				 Can we teach Large Language Models (LLMs) to refrain from hallucinating factual statements? In this paper we present a fine-tuning strategy that we call ConfQA, which can reduce hallucination rate from 20-40% to under 5% across multiple factuality benchmarks. The core idea is simple: when the LLM answers a question correctly, it is trained to continue with the answer; otherwise, it is trained to admit "I am unsure". But there are two key factors that make the training highly effective. First, we introduce a dampening prompt "answer only if you are confident" to explicitly guide the behavior, without which hallucination remains high as 15%-25%. Second, we leverage simple factual statements, specifically attribute values from knowledge graphs, to help LLMs calibrate the confidence, resulting in robust generalization across domains and question types. Building on this insight, we propose the Dual Neural Knowledge framework, which seamlessly select between internally parameterized neural knowledge and externally recorded symbolic knowledge based on ConfQA's confidence. The framework enables potential accuracy gains to beyond 95%, while reducing unnecessary external retrievals by over 30%.

Cartridges trained with self-study replicate in-context learning functionality while reducing memory and increasing throughput, and enable longer context lengths and composability at inference.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL). Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However, we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective. We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference time without retraining.

LLMs use progressive encoding and visualization to optimize the length of reasoning processes, enhancing accuracy and reducing inference time.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, techniques such as explicit structured reasoning have demonstrated strong test-time scaling behavior by enforcing a separation between the model's internal "thinking" process and the final response. A key factor influencing answer quality in this setting is the length of the thinking stage. When the reasoning is too short, the model may fail to capture the complexity of the task. Conversely, when it is too long, the model may overthink, leading to unnecessary computation and degraded performance. This paper explores and exploits the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs understand and regulate the length of their reasoning during explicit thought processes. First, we show that LLMs encode their progress through the reasoning process and introduce an interactive progress bar visualization, which is then used to reveal insights on the model's planning dynamics. Second, we manipulate the internal progress encoding during inference to reduce unnecessary steps and generate a more concise and decisive chain of thoughts. Our empirical results demonstrate that this "overclocking" method mitigates overthinking, improves answer accuracy, and reduces inference latency. Our code is publicly available.

Авторы демонстрируют, что LLM кодируют прогресс рассуждений и предлагают визуализацию в виде интерактивной полосы прогресса. Они манипулируют внутренним кодированием прогресса во время вывода, чтобы сократить ненужные шаги и генерировать более краткую цепочку мыслей. Эмпирические результаты показывают, что этот метод 'разгона' уменьшает излишние размышления, повышает точность ответов и сокращает задержку вывода.",

"LLMs use progressive encoding and visualization to optimize the length of reasoning processes, enhancing accuracy and reducing inference time.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, techniques such as explicit structured reasoning have demonstrated strong test-time scaling behavior by enforcing a separation between the model's internal "thinking" process and the final response. A key factor influencing answer quality in this setting is the length of the thinking stage. When the reasoning is too short, the model may fail to capture the complexity of the task. Conversely, when it is too long, the model may overthink, leading to unnecessary computation and degraded performance. This paper explores and exploits the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs understand and regulate the length of their reasoning during explicit thought processes. First, we show that LLMs encode their progress through the reasoning process and introduce an interactive progress bar visualization, which is then used to reveal insights on the model's planning dynamics.
