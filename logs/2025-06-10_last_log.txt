Text:"5 2 0 2 9 ] . [ 1 7 0 0 8 0 . 6 0 5 2 : r Reinforcement Pre-Training Qingxiu Dong Li Dong Yao Tang Tianzhu Ye Zhifang Sui Furu Wei Yutao Sun Microsoft Research Peking University Tsinghua University https://aka.ms/GeneralAI In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) as new scaling paradigm for large language models and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we reframe nexttoken prediction as reasoning task trained using RL, where it receives verifiable rewards for correctly predicting the next token for given context. RPT offers scalable method to leverage vast amounts of text data for general-purpose RL, rather than relying on domain-specific annotated answers. By incentivizing the capability of next-token reasoning, RPT significantly improves the language modeling accuracy of predicting the next tokens. Moreover, RPT provides strong pre-trained foundation for further reinforcement finetuning. The scaling curves show that increased training compute consistently improves the next-token prediction accuracy. The results position RPT as an effective and promising scaling paradigm to advance language model pre-training. Figure 1: Reinforcement pre-training (RPT) reframes next-token prediction as reasoning task, where the language model is incentivized via reinforcement learning (RL) to reason about and correctly predict the next token. The proposed approach allows RL to be scaled to the web-text corpus. The image of the cherry-on-top cake is taken from LeCuns slides [LeC16]. Equal contribution. Contact person: fuwei@microsoft.com. Reinforcement Pre-Training Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across wide range of tasks, largely driven by the scalability of the next-token prediction objective on vast text corpora. This self-supervised paradigm has proven to be an effective general-purpose pre-training approach. Concurrently, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as powerful technique for fine-tuning LLMs, aligning "

Text:"CCI4.0: Bilingual Pretraining Dataset for Enhancing Reasoning in Large Language Models Yang Yu Yao Xu Guang Liu Liangdong Wang Jiabei Chen Yu Bai Jijie Li Feng Liao Yonghua Lin 5 2 0 J 9 ] . [ 1 3 6 4 7 0 . 6 0 5 2 : r aWe introduce CCI4.0, large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset engineered for superior data quality and diverse human-like reasoning trajectory. CCI4.0 occupies roughly 35 TB of disk space and comprises two sub-datasets: CCI4.0-M2-Base and CCI4.0-M2-CoT. CCI4.0-M2-Base combines 5.2 TB carefully curated Chinese web corpus, 22.5 TB English subset from Nemotron-CC, and diverse sources from math, wiki, arxiv, and code. Although these data are mostly sourced from well-processed datasets, the quality standards of various domains are dynamic and require extensive expert experience and labor to process. So, we propose novel pipeline justifying data quality mainly based on models through two-stage deduplication, multiclassifier quality scoring, and domain-aware fluency filtering. We extract 4.5 billion pieces of CoT(Chain-of-Thought) templates, named CCI4.0M2-CoT. Differing from the distillation of CoT from larger models, our proposed staged CoT extraction exemplifies diverse reasoning patterns and significantly decreases the possibility of hallucination. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs pre-trained in CCI4.0 benefit from cleaner, more reliable training signals, yielding consistent improvements in downstream tasks, especially in math and code reflection tasks. Our results underscore the critical role of rigorous data curation and human thinking templates in advancing LLM performance, shedding some light on automatically processing pretraining corpora.In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across broad spectrum of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, translation, and sentiment analysis. critical factor underpinning these advances is the availability and quality of large-scale pre-training data [24, 33, 16]. Pre-training data not only shapes the linguistic capabilities of LLMs but also plays central role in determining their generalization and reasoning abilities across wide range of downstream applications. Despite growing efforts to curate and release open-source datasets for language model training [31, 30, 17], there remains significant gap in the availability of high-quality and diverse largescale corpora. Most existing resources are limited in either linguistic diversity or domain coverage, constraining the models ability to generalize beyond narrow contexts. Furthermore, although real-world data is often prioritized for its authenticity, synthetic data has emerged as an important complement, particularly in fostering reasoning skills. Nevertheless, high-quality synthetic pretraining datasetsespecially those that explicitly incorporate structured reasoningare still notably lacking. Corresponding Author, liuguang@baai.ac.cn Preprint. To address the aforementioned gaps and promote the advancement of data-centric development in large language models, we introduce CCI4.0-M2-Base: high-quality and diverse bilingual corpus in Chinese and English. In particular, CCI4.0-M2-Base includes large-scale, bilingual pretraining dataset (35T tokens) combining Chinese corpus and Nemotron-CCs English data, with meticulously-designed pipeline to yield high-quality dataset to enhance LLM general and reasoning capabilities. Moreover, to enhance the diversity of the corpus, we additionally incorporate high-quality source data from wide range of domains, including web pages, code, mathematics, academic papers, and encyclopedias. Furthermore, considering that the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are primarily developed during the pretraining phase [15, 39, 1], we provide CCI4.0-M2-CoT, which integrates 4.5 billion human thinking templates synthesized from high-quality samples using advanced techniques. While effective for general language understanding, traditional pretraining datasets often lack the specialized content needed to foster advanced reasoning skills, such as explicit representations of human thought processes or logical reasoning traces. To address this gap, we introduce CCI4.0-M2-CoT, whose templates are crafted to embed diverse reasoning patterns, strengthening the foundational reasoning abilities of LLMs, and decreasing the possibility of hallucination. Experimental results validate the efficacy of CCI4.0, demonstrating substantial performance improvements on knowledge-based and reasoning-intensive benchmarks such as MMLU and ARC-Challenge, with notable gains in commonsense reasoning and mathematical problem-solving. These findings underscore the critical role of high-quality, diverse and reasoning-focused pretraining data in advancing LLMs ability to tackle complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. By addressing the limitations of existing datasets, CCI4.0 sets new benchmark for pretraining and paves the way for the development of more capable and versatile language models. This paper makes the following core contributions: Introduction of CCI4.0-M2-Base: large-scale, bilingual pretraining dataset (35T tokens) combining Chinese corpus, Nemotron-CCs English data and corpora sourced from diverse domains, designed to enhance LLM general and reasoning capabilities. Incorporation of CCI4.0-M2-CoT: Integration of Diverse Reasoning Templates including 4.5 billion synthesized human thinking templates, embedding diverse reasoning patterns to bolster logical and commonsense reasoning and decrease the hallucination. Advanced Data Processing Pipeline: comprehensive methodology including deduplication, multi-classifier quality scoring, fluency filtering, CoT synthesis, and privacy/toxicity handling, ensuring high-quality and diverse data curation. Empirical Validation: Demonstration of significant performance gains on benchmarks like MMLU and ARC-Challenge, particularly in mathematical problem-solving and commonsense reasoning, outperforming baseline datasets such as Nemotron-CC-HQ and CCI3-HQ.

SAFFRON introduces multifurcation reward models to improve safety assurance in large language models by addressing the exploration-efficiency dilemma in inference scaling.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks. Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance. Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM) evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model (Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M) to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project homepage is at https://q-rz.github.io/p/saffron .

Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention (TACA) improves text-image alignment in diffusion-based multimodal transformers by dynamically balancing multimodal interactions and provides a parameter-efficient solution.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs) have achieved remarkable progress in text-driven visual generation. However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address these issues, we propose Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention (TACA), a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment. When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead. We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance, attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in text-to-image diffusion models.

A large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset, CCI4.0, enhances data quality and diverse reasoning patterns for language models, leading to improved performance in downstream tasks like math and code reflection.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce CCI4.0, a large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset engineered for superior data quality and diverse human-like reasoning trajectory. CCI4.0 occupies roughly 35 TB of disk space and comprises two sub-datasets: CCI4.0-M2-Base and CCI4.0-M2-CoT. CCI4.0-M2-Base combines a 5.2 TB carefully curated Chinese web corpus, a 22.5 TB English subset from Nemotron-CC, and diverse sources from math, wiki, arxiv, and code. Although these data are mostly sourced from well-processed datasets, the quality standards of various domains are dynamic and require extensive expert experience and labor to process. So, we propose a novel pipeline justifying data quality mainly based on models through two-stage deduplication, multiclassifier quality scoring, and domain-aware fluency filtering. We extract 4.5 billion pieces of CoT(Chain-of-Thought) templates, named CCI4.0-M2-CoT. Differing from the distillation of CoT from larger models, our proposed staged CoT extraction exemplifies diverse reasoning patterns and significantly decreases the possibility of hallucination. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs pre-trained in CCI4.0 benefit from cleaner, more reliable training signals, yielding consistent improvements in downstream tasks, especially in math and code reflection tasks. Our results underscore the critical role of rigorous data curation and human thinking templates in advancing LLM performance, shedding some light on automatically processing pretraining corpora.

"A large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset, CCI4.0, enhances data quality and diverse reasoning patterns for language models, leading to improved performance in downstream tasks like math and code reflection.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce CCI4.0, a large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset engineered for superior data quality and diverse human-like reasoning trajectory. CCI4.0 occupies roughly 35 TB of disk space and comprises two sub-datasets: CCI4.0-M2-Base and CCI4.0-M2-CoT. CCI4.0-M2-Base combines a 5.2 TB carefully curated Chinese web corpus, a 22.5 TB English subset from Nemotron-CC, and diverse sources from math, wiki, arxiv, and code. Although these data are mostly sourced from well-processed datasets, the quality standards of various domains are dynamic and require extensive expert experience and labor to process. So, we propose a novel pipeline justifying data quality mainly based on models through two-stage deduplication, multiclassifier quality scoring, and domain-aware fluency filtering. We extract 4.5 billion pieces of CoT(Chain-of-Thought) templates, named CCI4.0-M2-CoT. Differing from the distillation of CoT from larger models, our proposed staged CoT extraction exemplifies diverse reasoning patterns and significantly decreases the possibility of hallucination. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs pre-trained in CCI4.0 benefit from cleaner, more reliable training signals, yielding consistent improvements in downstream tasks, especially in math and code reflection tasks. Our results underscore the critical role of rigorous data curation and human thinking templates in advancing LLM performance, shedding some light on automatically processing pretraining corpora."
