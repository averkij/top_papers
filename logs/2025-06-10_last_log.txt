Building on this framework, we design an algorithm with regularization terms to control the resulting condition numbers after pre-training. Empirical results on linear models and non-linear deep-nets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on model immunization. The code is available at https://github.com/amberyzheng/ model-immunization-cond-num. 1. Introduction Model immunization, recently proposed by Zheng & Yeh (2024), studies how to pre-train model that is more difficult to fine-tune on harmful content, but not others. The aim is to mitigate the risk of misuse (Brundage et al., 2018; Marchal et al., 2024) associated with open-sourced models by immunizing them before they are released to the public. Zheng & Yeh (2024) focus on immunizing text-to-image models, where they formulate immunization as bi-level optimization. Empirically, they show that pre-trained diffusion models that undergo immunization are more difficult to finetune on given harmful concept dataset. To quantify this difficulty, they compare the generation quality of models with and without immunization after fixed number of finetuning iterations. While the empirical results are promising, *Equal contribution 1Department of Computer Science, Purdue University. Correspondence to: Raymond A. Yeh <rayyeh@purdue.edu>.

Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 definition of an immunized model and the circumstances that make immunization possible remain unclear. To tackle this issue, we propose framework to study model immunization using the condition number (Gloub & Van Loan, 1996). The effectiveness of immunization can be characterized by the condition number of the Hessian matrix. When using gradient-based methods during finetuning, condition number closer to one indicates faster convergence (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004), i.e., easier to fine-tune. With this perspective, we observe that the existence of an effective immunization for linear models is related to the angle between the singular vectors of the harmful fine-tuning datasets covariance matrix and the pretraining datasets covariance matrix. From this condition number perspective, we propose an immunization algorithm to find such model. In detail, we propose two additional terms to regularize the condition number during pre-training. Each of the introduced regularization terms can be shown to ensure monotonic increase/decrease of the condition number under gradient updates. Beyond the theoretical results, we empirically validate the proposed algorithm on linear models for regression and image classification tasks. Lastly, we conduct experiments using the proposed algorithm on non-linear models, i.e., deep-nets. Despite the gap in theory, we observe that the proposed approach remains effective at model immunization across ResNet (He et al., 2016) and ViT (Dosovitskiy, 2021). Our contributions are summarized as follows: We introduce framework based on the condition number to study the task of model immunization. This framework leads to concrete definition of an immunized model along with novel experiment setup and evaluation metric to compare the quality of different immunization techniques. We propose regularizers to maximize/minimize the condition number, with guaranteed monotonic increase/decrease when updated with the gradient-based method. Together with the task objective and regularizers, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively immunizes linear models and deep-nets on regression/image classification tasks. Model Immunization from Condition Number Perspective 2. Preliminaries This section provides the background of the condition number and its connection to gradient descent. Additionally, we briefly review transfer learning (Zhuang et al., 2020), as it can be technique for misusing open-source models. Condition number and convergence of gradient descent. Given general matrix S, the condition number (Gloub & Van Loan, 1996) is defined as (cid:13)S(cid:13) (cid:13) κ(S) S2 /σmin , (cid:13)2 = σmax (1) where is the pseudoinverse and σS corresponds to the max/min singular value of S. The condition number is related to the convergence rate of gradient-based algorithms. Consider an optimization problem minw L(w) where is strongly convex and has Hessian 2L with max/min singular values denoted as σmax/min. In this case, the constant step-size steepest descent algorithm has convergence rate (Bubeck, 2015) of the following wt w2 (cid:18) 1 (cid:19)t σmin σmax w0 w2, (2) where denotes the optimal solution, and wt denotes the steepest descent iterate at step t. We can observe that larger condition number corresponds to slower convergence. Condition number regularization. Nenov et al. (2024) proposed regularizer for minimizing the condition number of some general matrix Rwell(S) = 1 S2 2 1 2p S2 , (3) in which is the minimum dimension of S, and the norms correspond to the spectral norm and Frobenius norm. They showed that Rwell(S) is valid regularizer by proving its nonnegativity, and is an upper bound on log (κ (S)). In addition, they showed that Rwell(S) is differentiable under some mild conditions, and if updated with gradient descent, it is guaranteed to decrease the condition number monotonically.

(2024), we propose differentiable regularizer that is guaranteed to increase the condition number as an upper bound on 1/log (κ (S)).

Text:"5 2 0 2 7 ] . [ 1 8 5 6 6 0 . 6 0 5 2 : r Self-Adapting Improvement Loops for Robotic Learning Calvin Luo*,1 , Zilai Zeng*,1, Mingxi Jia1, Yilun Du2, Chen Sun1 1Brown University, 2Harvard University Abstract: Video generative models trained on expert demonstrations have been utilized as performant text-conditioned visual planners for solving robotic tasks. However, generalization to unseen tasks remains challenge. Whereas improved generalization may be facilitated by leveraging learned prior knowledge from additional pre-collected offline data sources, such as web-scale video datasets, in the era of experience we aim to design agents that can continuously improve in an online manner from self-collected behaviors. In this work we thus propose the SelfAdapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an in-domain video model iteratively updates itself on self-produced trajectories, collected through adaptation with an internet-scale pretrained video model, and steadily improves its performance for specified task of interest. We apply SAIL to diverse suite of MetaWorld tasks, as well as two manipulation tasks on real robot arm, and find that performance improvements continuously emerge over multiple iterations for novel tasks initially unseen during original in-domain video model training. Furthermore, we discover that SAIL is surprisingly robust regarding if and how the self-collected experience is filtered, and the quality of the initial in-domain demonstrations. Through adaptation with summarized internet-scale data, and learning through online experience, we thus demonstrate way to iteratively bootstrap high-performance video model for solving novel robotic tasks through self-improvement. Visualizations and code can be found at diffusion-supervision.github.io/sail/. Keywords: Planning, Adaptation, Self-Improvement, Robots, Learning Advancements in video generative modeling capabilities have directly led to their increased utilization as visual planners for robotic applicatio"

An algorithm with regularization terms based on the condition number of a Hessian matrix is proposed to analyze and achieve model immunization, demonstrating effectiveness on both linear models and deep-nets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Model immunization aims to pre-train models that are difficult to fine-tune on harmful tasks while retaining their utility on other non-harmful tasks. Though prior work has shown empirical evidence for immunizing text-to-image models, the key understanding of when immunization is possible and a precise definition of an immunized model remain unclear. In this work, we propose a framework, based on the condition number of a Hessian matrix, to analyze model immunization for linear models. Building on this framework, we design an algorithm with regularization terms to control the resulting condition numbers after pre-training. Empirical results on linear models and non-linear deep-nets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on model immunization. The code is available at https://github.com/amberyzheng/model-immunization-cond-num.

SAIL, a self-adapting improvement loop, iteratively enhances a video model using self-produced data and pretrained models, achieving continuous performance improvement on novel robotic tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video generative models trained on expert demonstrations have been utilized as performant text-conditioned visual planners for solving robotic tasks. However, generalization to unseen tasks remains a challenge. Whereas improved generalization may be facilitated by leveraging learned prior knowledge from additional pre-collected offline data sources, such as web-scale video datasets, in the era of experience we aim to design agents that can continuously improve in an online manner from self-collected behaviors. In this work we thus propose the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an in-domain video model iteratively updates itself on self-produced trajectories, collected through adaptation with an internet-scale pretrained video model, and steadily improves its performance for a specified task of interest. We apply SAIL to a diverse suite of MetaWorld tasks, as well as two manipulation tasks on a real robot arm, and find that performance improvements continuously emerge over multiple iterations for novel tasks initially unseen during original in-domain video model training. Furthermore, we discover that SAIL is surprisingly robust regarding if and how the self-collected experience is filtered, and the quality of the initial in-domain demonstrations. Through adaptation with summarized internet-scale data, and learning through online experience, we thus demonstrate a way to iteratively bootstrap a high-performance video model for solving novel robotic tasks through self-improvement.

"SAIL, a self-adapting improvement loop, iteratively enhances a video model using self-produced data and pretrained models, achieving continuous performance improvement on novel robotic tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video generative models trained on expert demonstrations have been utilized as performant text-conditioned visual planners for solving robotic tasks. However, generalization to unseen tasks remains a challenge. Whereas improved generalization may be facilitated by leveraging learned prior knowledge from additional pre-collected offline data sources, such as web-scale video datasets, in the era of experience we aim to design agents that can continuously improve in an online manner from self-collected behaviors. In this work we thus propose the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an in-domain video model iteratively updates itself on self-produced trajectories, collected through adaptation with an internet-scale pretrained video model, and steadily improves its performance for a specified task of interest. We apply SAIL to a diverse suite of MetaWorld tasks, as well as two manipulation tasks on a real robot arm, and find that performance improvements continuously emerge over multiple iterations for novel tasks initially unseen during original in-domain video model training. Furthermore, we discover that SAIL is surprisingly robust regarding if and how the self-collected experience is filtered, and the quality of the initial in-domain demonstrations. Through adaptation with summarized internet-scale data, and learning through online experience, we thus demonstrate a way to iteratively bootstrap a high-performance video model for solving novel robotic tasks through self-improvement."

tau²-bench introduces a dual-control benchmark for conversational AI agents in telecommunications, simulating user-agent collaboration and evaluating their performance in reasoning and coordination.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing benchmarks for conversational AI agents simulate single-control environments, where only the AI agent can use tools to interact with the world, while the user remains a passive information provider. This differs from real-world scenarios like technical support, where users need to actively participate in modifying the state of the (shared) world. In order to address this gap, we introduce tau^2-bench, with four key contributions:   1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, where both agent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic environment that tests both agent coordination and communication,   2) A compositional task generator that programmatically creates diverse, verifiable tasks from atomic components, ensuring domain coverage and controlled complexity,   3) A reliable user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose behavior is constrained by tools and observable states, improving simulation fidelity,   4) Fine-grained analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations including separating errors arising from reasoning vs communication/coordination.   In particular, our experiments show significant performance drops when agents shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding users. Overall, tau^2-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents that must both reason effectively and guide user actions.

LLM agents improve their strategic planning and adapt over time when placed in complex environments like Settlers of Catan, outperforming static baselines through self-evolving mechanisms and collaboration among specialized roles.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer, Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay, research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude 3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.
