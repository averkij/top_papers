Text:"CLARE: Continual Learning for Vision-Language-Action Models via Autonomous Adapter Routing and Expansion Ralf Romer,1 Yi Zhang,1 Angela P. Schoellig1,2 6 2 0 2 J 4 1 ] . [ 1 2 1 5 9 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r Abstract To teach robots complex manipulation tasks, it is now common practice to fine-tune pre-trained visionlanguage-action model (VLA) on task-specific data. However, since this recipe updates existing representations, it is unsuitable for long-term operation in the real world, where robots must continually adapt to new tasks and environments while retaining the knowledge they have already acquired. Existing continual learning methods for robotics commonly require storing previous data (exemplars), struggle with long task sequences, or rely on task identifiers for deployment. To address these limitations, we propose CLARE, general, parameter-efficient framework for exemplar-free continual learning with VLAs. CLARE introduces lightweight modular adapters into selected feedforward layers and autonomously expands the model only where necessary when learning new task, guided by layer-wise feature similarity. During deployment, an autoencoder-based routing mechanism dynamically activates the most relevant adapters without requiring task labels. Through extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark, we show that CLARE achieves high performance on new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of earlier tasks, significantly outperforming even exemplar-based methods. Code and data are available at the project website: tum-lsy.github.io/clare. I. INTRODUCTION Robots deployed in homes, hospitals, or warehouses must operate for long periods while facing ever-changing conditions and task demands. household robot may encounter newly purchased appliance, or an assistive robot may meet patients with unfamiliar mobility profiles. In such settings, robots must continually acquire new skills without sacrificing previously acquired capabilities. This long-term adaptability, known as continua"
