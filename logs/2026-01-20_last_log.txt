Our results provide mechanistic roadmap for identifying and mitigating data contamination in RLVRtuned models1. 1. Introduction Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has established itself as powerful paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), by treating the final-answer correctness as the reward signal, showing particular promise in deterministic domains such as mathematics and coding (Guo et al., 2025; Lambert et al., 1Southern University of Science and Technology 2University of Aberdeen 3Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) 4East China Normal University. Correspondence to: Ruizhe Li, Chris Lee <ruizhe.li@abdn.ac.uk>. Preprint. January 19, 2026. 1Code is available at https://github.com/idwts/ How-RLVR-Activates-Memorization-Shortcuts. 1 2024). The standard interpretation of RLVRs success relies on the assumption that performance improvements derive from models optimizing robust reasoning policies through ground-truth supervision. However, recent empirical studies have complicated this narrative: the Qwen2.5-Math model family achieved significant performance gains on standard benchmarks (e.g., MATH-500, AIME) even when trained with spurious rewardssignals that were random, purely format-based, or even incorrect (Shao et al., 2025). Building on these observations, another work (Wu et al., 2025b) argued that such gains are less likely the result of genuine reasoning generalization and more attributable to data contamination, identifying that Qwen2.5 had likely memorized the test sets during pre-training. Synthesizing these observations raises critical question: if the base model already contained the contaminated data, why was its initial accuracy limited, and how could training with incorrect rewards paradoxically unlock this performance? We hypothesize that spurious RLVR activates the models latent capacity for memorization, overriding general reasoning pathways in favor of retrieving stored answers. To validate this hypothesis, it is essential to situate these findings within the reasoning-memorization in LLMs. Recent interpretability research has sought to distinguish these behaviors, with studies identifying specific neuron activation patterns that signal memorization (Slonski, 2024) or isolating linear directions in the residual stream that mediate the switch between reasoning and memory modes (Hong et al., 2025). Notably, the phenomenon of over-memorization has been linked to counterintuitive loss landscapes, where models maintain high test accuracy despite exhibiting high test perplexity (Ruan et al., 2025): finding that strongly corroborates the behavioral anomalies we observe in this work. However, while these studies characterize memorization in general pre-training or finetuning contexts, they do not explain the specific dynamics of spurious RLVR. critical gap remains: distinct from standard training, how exactly does spurious RLVR trigger this mode switch? The internal mechanisms that allow Qwen2.5 to abandon general reasoning for stubborn memorization under such conditions remain largely opaque. To address this questions, we investigate the learning dynamics of LLMs subjected to spurious RLVR training. We define Spurious Rewards Paradox: Mechanistically Understanding How RLVR Activates Memorization Shortcuts in LLMs spurious RLVR as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards where the reward signal is decoupled from genuine reasoning quality, including random rewards, format-only rewards, or intentionally incorrect rewards. We uncover phenomenon that mirrors the over-memorization signatures identified in prior work (Ruan et al., 2025): as spurious rewards typically degrade language modeling globally, the contaminated model exhibits unique divergence where perplexity on answer tokens decreases significantly, even as prompt perplexity rises. This divergence provides compelling evidence that the Qwen model is not acquiring genuine reasoning capabilities (Yue et al., 2025); instead, the optimization trajectory results in degraded prompt-side coherence as side effect of shortcut formation, direct mapping from specific prompts to memorized answers. To uncover the physical location of this shortcut, we employ comprehensive mechanistic analysis combining Path Patching (Meng et al., 2022), Logit Lens (nostalgebraist, 2020), and Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) metrics. Our investigation reveals crucial decoupling between function and structure within the Qwen models layers. Specifically, we identify the middle layers (L18L20) as the Functional Anchor, where the critical decision to retrieve memorized answer is causally determined and high-probability trigger token is injected. Conversely, the subsequent layers (L21+) act as Structural Adapters, exhibiting the most substantial weight changes (high JSD) not to store knowledge, but to perform representational transformation that reorganizes the internal state to accommodate the abrupt signal from the functional anchor layers. We further formalize this dynamic process by modeling the layer-wise evolution of hidden states as continuous trajectory (Li et al., 2025a; Oh et al., 20"
