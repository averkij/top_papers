Despite reducing model creation time, critical gap remains between user expectations and generated output quality. Current T23D tools operate in an end-to-end black-box manner N. Xiang, T. Liang, H. Huang, S. Jiang, H. Huang, Y. Huang, L. Chen, C. Wang, and C. Li are with East China Normal University. These authors contributed equally. Chenhui Li and Liangyu Chen are corresponding authors.

They offer limited control over the generation process and frequently produce models that fail to meet expectations [18, 28, 52]. The absence of effective prompt recommendation mechanisms forces users into costly trial-and-error cycles. This disrupts creative workflows and limits the technologys practical utility for professional designers. Recent advances in prompt engineering have shown promise in textto-image domains [5, 13], enabling efficient candidate exploration and prompt refinement. However, translating these approaches to T23D generation introduces unique challenges. Unlike 2D images, 3D models require physical structural integrity. Moreover, effective evaluation must consider geometry, texture, and coherence across multiple viewsa multi-dimensional quality assessment problem beyond current prompt engineering frameworks. To bridge this gap, can we develop visual approach that transforms costly trial-and-error into structured exploration for text-to-3D generation? Our formative study (Sec. 3) with professional designers However, current prompt engineering is largely confined to 2D. To overcome this limitation, we propose novel approach leveraging multiview images as an intermediate representation. The key innovation is our semantic-based treemap wordle, which introduces T23D imagetext matching [22] to link prompts to multi-view images. This allows users to intuitively perceive how different parts of prompts contribute to specific 3D regions and iteratively refine inputs by selecting relevant keywords. 2.2 Creativity Support Systems Creativity support systems (CSS) have been extensively studied in HCI by leveraging generative models and interactive tools to enhance human creativity in design workflows. In text-to-text and text-to-image generation, systems such as TaleBrush [11] combined sketches with generative language models to support storytelling. PromptPaint [10], on the other hand, enabled users to guide image generation through paint-like interactions, highlighting CSSs potential to inspire both visual and textual creativity. In interface design, Scout [50] supported rapid exploration of layout alternatives through high-level constraints, underscoring CSSs role in enhancing design efficiency and fostering innovation. For visual search, GenQuery [48] used generative models to support expressive query formulation, helping users retrieve content aligned with their creative intent. In 3D design, 3DALL-E [30] incorporated text-to-image AI into 3D modeling workflows, providing designers with inspiration and reference images while preventing design fixation. In contrast, our system directly generates diverse and high-quality 3D models, offering designers immediate creative inspiration rather than relying on indirect image references. 2.3 Shape Exploration The field of shape exploration has evolved significantly, driven by the need to navigate and understand large collections of images and 3D models. The pioneering work of Design Galleries by Marks et al. [32] laid the foundation by introducing novel user interface concept for browsing collections through parametric representation space. Building on this, Averkiou et al. [2] extended the concept into 3D space, advancing shape exploration methodologies. Subsequent research introduced techniques like tree-based visualizations [4], augmented scatter plots [20,57,61,68], and node-link graphs [25,63,64] for large-scale exploration. These approaches have enriched our ability to visualize and delve into complex datasets, revealing intricate structures and relationships. In interactive summarization and conceptual design, Juxtaform by Pandey et al. [39] enables designers to efficiently navigate large collections and derive new shape ideas, addressing key challenges in conceptual design. Existing shape exploration techniques often neglect the dynamic exploration of 3D models generated from textual descri"

Sel3DCraft enhances text-to-3D generation through a dual-branch retrieval and generation system, multi-view hybrid scoring with MLLMs, and prompt-driven visual analytics, improving designer creativity.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-3D (T23D) generation has transformed digital content creation, yet remains bottlenecked by blind trial-and-error prompting processes that yield unpredictable results. While visual prompt engineering has advanced in text-to-image domains, its application to 3D generation presents unique challenges requiring multi-view consistency evaluation and spatial understanding. We present Sel3DCraft, a visual prompt engineering system for T23D that transforms unstructured exploration into a guided visual process. Our approach introduces three key innovations: a dual-branch structure combining retrieval and generation for diverse candidate exploration; a multi-view hybrid scoring approach that leverages MLLMs with innovative high-level metrics to assess 3D models with human-expert consistency; and a prompt-driven visual analytics suite that enables intuitive defect identification and refinement. Extensive testing and user studies demonstrate that Sel3DCraft surpasses other T23D systems in supporting creativity for designers.

"Sel3DCraft enhances text-to-3D generation through a dual-branch retrieval and generation system, multi-view hybrid scoring with MLLMs, and prompt-driven visual analytics, improving designer creativity.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-3D (T23D) generation has transformed digital content creation, yet remains bottlenecked by blind trial-and-error prompting processes that yield unpredictable results. While visual prompt engineering has advanced in text-to-image domains, its application to 3D generation presents unique challenges requiring multi-view consistency evaluation and spatial understanding. We present Sel3DCraft, a visual prompt engineering system for T23D that transforms unstructured exploration into a guided visual process. Our approach introduces three key innovations: a dual-branch structure combining retrieval and generation for diverse candidate exploration; a multi-view hybrid scoring approach that leverages MLLMs with innovative high-level metrics to assess 3D models with human-expert consistency; and a prompt-driven visual analytics suite that enables intuitive defect identification and refinement. Extensive testing and user studies demonstrate that Sel3DCraft surpasses other T23D systems in supporting creativity for designers."

A framework using entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning and token-wise entropy-adaptive reinforcement learning improves instruction adherence in LLMs by fostering rigorous reasoning processes.  					AI-generated summary 				 While advancements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs have significantly enhanced their performance in solving mathematical problems, coding tasks, and general puzzles, their effectiveness in accurately adhering to instructions remains inconsistent, particularly with more complex directives. Our investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard, easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns. Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning (Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL) reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking. Extensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate remarkable performance improvements across various model scales. Notably, our Light-IF-32B model surpasses both larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-R1 and closed-source models like Doubao-1.6.
