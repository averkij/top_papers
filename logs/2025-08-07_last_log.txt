Text:"5 2 0 2 5 ] . [ 2 1 9 1 1 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs Mirage? Data Distribution Lens Chengshuai Zhao1, Zhen Tan1, Pingchuan Ma1, Dawei Li1, Bohan Jiang1, Yancheng Wang1, Yingzhen Yang1 and Huan Liu1 1Arizona State University, USA Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataA lchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Text:"5 2 0 2 6 ] . [ 1 6 8 5 4 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r Position: The Current AI Conference Model is Unsustainable! Diagnosing the Crisis of Centralized AI Conference Nuo Chen Moming Duan Andre Huikai Lin Qian Wang Jiaying Wu Bingsheng He National University of Singapore Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences are essential for advancing research, sharing knowledge, and fostering academic community. However, their rapid expansion has rendered the centralized conference model increasingly unsustainable. This paper offers data-driven diagnosis of structural crisis that threatens the foundational goals of scientific dissemination, equity, and community well-being. We identify four key areas of strain: (1) scientifically, with per-author publication rates more than doubling over the past decade to over 4.5 papers annually; (2) environmentally, with the carbon footprint of single conference exceeding the daily emissions of its host city; (3) psychologically, with 71% of online community discourse reflecting negative sentiment and 35% referencing mental health concerns; and (4) logistically, with attendance at top conferences such as NeurIPS 2024 beginning to outpace venue capacity. These pressures point to system that is misaligned with its core mission. In response, we propose the Community-Federated Conference (CFC) model, which separates peer review, presentation, and networking into globally coordinated but locally organized components, offering more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient path forward for AI research. Academic conferences are the lifeblood of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. They serve as primary venues for disseminating cutting-edge research, facilitating invaluable networking, and shaping the trajectory of the field. The growth of major conferences like NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR is testament to the dynamism and impact of AI research.

INTRODUCTION Holistic 3D scene understanding is key challenge in computer vision, especially for autonomous vehicles [1], [2]. However, current research [3][5] struggles with finegrained spatial reasoning and cognitive scene interpretation. Visual grounding [6] is one of the most promising tasks in this domain, which focuses on localizing objects from natural language descriptions. Traditional bounding boxbased methods [7], [8] often fail to capture full complexity of real-world objects. This is particularly evident for irregularly shaped or partially occluded objects [9]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, bounding boxes are insufficient for accurately representing complex objects, such as excavators, with non-rectangular structures. In contrast, 3D occupancy representations provide more precise way to capture the object shapes and details. Existing datasets have made significant progress in visual grounding, with ScanRefer [10] and Sr3D [11] used for indoor object localization, and datasets such as Mono3DRefer [7] and Talk2Car [12] for autonomous driving. Emerging datasets such as Talk2Radar [13] and Talk2LiDAR [14] 1Zhan Shi is with the College of Software Technology, Zhejiang University. Song Wang and Jianke Zhu are with the College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China. Jianke Zhu is the corresponding author.

Conventional bounding boxes cannot accurately describe irregularly shaped vehicles in daily driving scenes, such as the excavators in (a) and (c). In contrast, 3D occupancy representations provide more precise depiction of complex obstacles, as shown in (b) and (d). contribute but are not publicly available. Moreover, these datasets are limited to bounding box-based understanding and do not incorporate voxel-level occupancy prediction, which is essential for fine-grained spatial understanding. We bridge this gap by integrating occupancy prediction into 3D visual grounding. As shown in Fig. 2, our 3D occupancy grounding task combines natural language descriptions with voxel-level spatial precision, allowing more detailed understanding of complex environments. This task enhances both localization and fine-grained occupancy perception, which are crucial for autonomous decision-making. To advance this research, we introduce Talk2Occ, new benchmark designed for 3D occupancy grounding in autonomous driving scenarios. Talk2Occ combines the Talk2Car [12] dataset with the Occ3D [15] dataset, linking them through the nuScenes dataset [16]. The Talk2Occ dataset includes surround-view images, LiDAR point clouds, 3D occupancy ground truth, and corresponding natural language descriptions. This new task presents unique challenges, including the need for more precise localization and detailed spatial understanding, which motivates the development of advanced models for 3D occupancy grounding. To address the challenges of 3D occupancy grounding, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model that integrates occupancy prediction with grounding. Our approach combines 2D grounding and depth estimation module, which is supervised by occupancy-rendered depth maps, enabling it to utilize spatial information from multiple modalities. Our main contributions are summarized as below. We introduce occupancy prediction into 3D visual grounding to enable text-guided human-machine interIllustration for 3D occupancy grounding. (a) Our proposed 3D occupancy grounding aims to perceive the 3D occupancy of the referred object in Fig. 2. scene using language descriptions. (b) The traditional 3D visual grounding intends to estimate the location and size of the referred object.

(d) The counterpart 2D task does not capture the 3D extent of the referred object. action for fine-grained occupancy perception. novel benchmark for 3D occupancy grounding in autonomous driving, Talk2Occ, bridges natural language with voxel-level spatial understanding. An end-to-end multi-branch network, GroundingOcc, that integrates visual, textual, and point-cloud features for precise voxel-level occupancy grounding. It leverages multi-branch architecture with 2D grounding and depth estimation to improve accuracy. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D occupancy grounding and sets new benchmark for voxel-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves localization accuracy, outperforming the baseline by 18.13%. II. RELATED WORK 2D Visual Grounding.

Sotopia-RL, a novel reinforcement learning framework, enhances social intelligence in large language models by refining feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards, improving performance in social tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability, where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards. Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking. Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17 on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training.

CoT reasoning in LLMs is found to be limited by the distribution discrepancy between training and test data, suggesting it is not a robust form of reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

The paper diagnoses structural issues in AI conferences, including publication rates, carbon footprint, negative community sentiment, and logistical challenges, and proposes a Community-Federated Conference model to address these issues.  					AI-generated summary 				 Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences are essential for advancing research, sharing knowledge, and fostering academic community. However, their rapid expansion has rendered the centralized conference model increasingly unsustainable. This paper offers a data-driven diagnosis of a structural crisis that threatens the foundational goals of scientific dissemination, equity, and community well-being. We identify four key areas of strain: (1) scientifically, with per-author publication rates more than doubling over the past decade to over 4.5 papers annually; (2) environmentally, with the carbon footprint of a single conference exceeding the daily emissions of its host city; (3) psychologically, with 71% of online community discourse reflecting negative sentiment and 35% referencing mental health concerns; and (4) logistically, with attendance at top conferences such as NeurIPS 2024 beginning to outpace venue capacity. These pressures point to a system that is misaligned with its core mission. In response, we propose the Community-Federated Conference (CFC) model, which separates peer review, presentation, and networking into globally coordinated but locally organized components, offering a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient path forward for AI research.

"The paper diagnoses structural issues in AI conferences, including publication rates, carbon footprint, negative community sentiment, and logistical challenges, and proposes a Community-Federated Conference model to address these issues.  					AI-generated summary 				 Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences are essential for advancing research, sharing knowledge, and fostering academic community. However, their rapid expansion has rendered the centralized conference model increasingly unsustainable. This paper offers a data-driven diagnosis of a structural crisis that threatens the foundational goals of scientific dissemination, equity, and community well-being. We identify four key areas of strain: (1) scientifically, with per-author publication rates more than doubling over the past decade to over 4.5 papers annually; (2) environmentally, with the carbon footprint of a single conference exceeding the daily emissions of its host city; (3) psychologically, with 71% of online community discourse reflecting negative sentiment and 35% referencing mental health concerns; and (4) logistically, with attendance at top conferences such as NeurIPS 2024 beginning to outpace venue capacity. These pressures point to a system that is misaligned with its core mission. In response, we propose the Community-Federated Conference (CFC) model, which separates peer review, presentation, and networking into globally coordinated but locally organized components, offering a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient path forward for AI research."

HPSv3, a human preference score using a wide-spectrum dataset and uncertainty-aware ranking loss, enhances text-to-image generation quality through iterative refinement.  					AI-generated summary 				 Evaluating text-to-image generation models requires alignment with human perception, yet existing human-centric metrics are constrained by limited data coverage, suboptimal feature extraction, and inefficient loss functions. To address these challenges, we introduce Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3). (1) We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating 1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated pairwise comparisons from state-of-the-art generative models and low to high-quality real-world images. (2) We introduce a VLM-based preference model trained using an uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and human-aligned approach to improve image generation quality. The code and dataset are available at the HPSv3 Homepage.

Sculptor, a framework for Active Context Management, enhances LLM performance on long contexts by enabling proactive attention and memory control, reducing proactive interference and improving reasoning reliability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs' capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore, and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies, rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

A novel framework uses a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE and Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model to generate high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs, demonstrating superior quality and generalization.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting, and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space. Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

"A novel framework uses a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE and Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model to generate high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs, demonstrating superior quality and generalization.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting, and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space. Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

LeanK, a learning-based method, prunes unimportant key cache channels in large language models to reduce memory usage and accelerate decoding without sacrificing accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process, LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel enables 1.3x speedup for attention computation.

A framework for web agents decomposes their capabilities into knowledge content learning and cognitive processes, using a structured dataset and a novel reasoning framework to enhance generalization and performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore, we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities.

A benchmark and model for 3D occupancy grounding using natural language and voxel-level annotations improve object perception in autonomous driving.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task. Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual, and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting model performance.

"A benchmark and model for 3D occupancy grounding using natural language and voxel-level annotations improve object perception in autonomous driving.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task. Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual, and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc."
