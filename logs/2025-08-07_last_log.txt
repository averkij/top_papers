VERIGUI: VERIFIABLE LONG-CHAIN GUI DATASET VeriGUI TeamRecent studies have delved into constructing autonomous agents capable of performing complex Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based computer tasks, with the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction. Despite encouraging results, existing efforts mainly focus on short-term interactions and rely on outcomeonly verification, thereby limiting their scalability in real-world GUI applications that demand long-horizon task decomposition and execution. In this work, we introduce VeriGUI, novel verifiable long-chain GUI dataset designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of generalist GUI agents operating in realistic computer environments. Our dataset emphasizes two critical dimensions: (1) long-chain complexity, with tasks decomposed into sequence of interdependent subtasks spanning hundreds of steps, explicitly designed to allow any subtask to serve as valid starting point; and (2) subtask-level verifiability, which enables diverse exploration strategies within each subtask, while ensuring that each subtasklevel goal remains verifiable and consistent. The dataset consists of GUI task trajectories across both desktop and web, annotated by human experts. Extensive experiments on VeriGUI using various agents with different foundation models reveal significant performance gaps in handling long-horizon tasks, highlighting the need for more robust planning and decision-making capabilities in GUI agents. https://github.com/VeriGUI-Team/VeriGUI https://huggingface.co/datasets/2077AIDataFoundation/VeriGUIAutonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have recently demonstrated extraordinary capabilities in interactive computer tasks by following high-level instructions (Wang et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a; Nguyen et al., 2024), supporting diverse workflows from web browsing to desktop applications (Ning et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2024). Recent breakthroughs in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) (Zhang et al., 2024c; Team et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2023) have enabled promising prototypes of such agents that can perform complex decisionmaking tasks without relying on hard-coded automation or domain-specific scripting (Tan et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2023). However, developing such general-purpose GUI agents involves multiple complex processes, as it requires the ability to perceive complex visual layouts (Hong et al., 2024; Gou et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2024), plan over long action sequences (Zhang et al., 2024d; Agashe et al., 2024), and generalize across dynamic and heterogeneous platforms (Wu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025). This also poses new challenge: how to obtain high-quality datasets that capture diverse, realistic human-computer interactions at scale to evaluate these agents effectively (Deng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024b). To address this challenge, various datasets and benchmarks have been released to facilitate the development of autonomous GUI agents (Zhang et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025; He et al., 2024). Despite encouraging results, existing GUI datasets still suffer from two major limitations. First, most recent datasets focus on relatively short-term interactions (L`u et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025), where the agent can complete task in just few steps (e.g., mostly less than 10 steps), typically by identifying UI element and executing corresponding action (Li et al., 2025; Deng et al., 2023). For example, task like Search for an email about the invoice can typically be completed in just three steps: open the email app, click the search bar, and type the keyword. Such interactions rarely require long-horizon planning or multi-step reasoning (Gao et al., 2024; Bonatti et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024), both of which are essential for solving real-world workflows involving conditional 1 This work is still in progress and additional data will be included in future version. Figure 1: An overview of the VeriGUI dataset, which emphasizes (1) long-chain complexity, where each tasks consist of interdependent subtasks that span hundreds of steps, with each subtask serving as valid starting point; and (2) subtask-level verifiability, enabling diverse exploration strategies while ensuring that the goal of each subtask is verifiable and consistent. task dependencies and intermediate state tracking (Deng et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2025). Second, existing evaluation protocols typically rely on outcome-only validation such as checking whether the final page URL has been reached (Zhou et al., 2023a; Xie et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2025). This coarse-grained supervision fails to capture the quality of intermediate subtasks, especially when tasks involve multiple interdependent subtasks (Pan et al., 2024). In such cases, when agents fail to achieve the desired goal, it is often unclear where or why the failure occurred, thereby making it difficult to support improvements to agent capability. In this work, we introduce VeriGUI, new verifiable long-chain dataset tailored for the development and evaluation of GUI agents. VeriGUI encompasses various richly annotated GUI task trajectories across desktop and web. All trajectories are carefully created and annotated by human experts, ensuring long-chain complexity and subtask-level verifiability, as shown in Fig. 1. (1) The long-chain complexity of VeriGUI features tasks that require agents to perform sequences of 4-8 interdependent subtasks with hundreds of GUI operations, often involving transitions across multiple applications or webpages. Notably, each subtask is designed to serve as valid starting point, enabling agent evaluation across different task stages. To succeed, agents must engage in adaptive reasoning to manage dynamic task flows. This setup encourages the development of agents with robust planning, memory, and decision-making abilities across wide range of complex GUI environments. (2) The subtask-level verifiability of VeriGUI enables fine-grained assessment of intermediate results at every subtask rather than solely at the final outcome. Note that subtask consists of multiple steps with specific GUI operations. Instead of verifying the low-level steps, the dataset focuses on evaluating whether the goal of each subtask has been correctly achieved, providing more info"

[ 1 5 9 2 4 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r AbstractRusts compile-time safety guarantees make it ideal for safety-critical systems, creating demand for translating legacy codebases to Rust. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based solutions face challenges in meeting code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based solutions often fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EVOC2RUST, an automated framework for converting entire projects to equivalent Rust ones. EVOC2RUST employs skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three evolutionary stages: 1) it first decomposes the project into functional modules, employs feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros and generates type-checked function stubs, which form compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates the function, replacing the corresponding stub placeholder; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EVOC2RUST combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates EVOC2RUSTs superior performance in projectlevel C-to-Rust translation. On average, it achieves 17.24% and 14.32% improvements in syntax and semantic accuracy over the LLM-based app"

[ 1 3 1 3 3 2 . 7 0 5 2 : r ABSTRACT Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/ artistic-prompt-interpretation.

VeriGUI is a novel dataset for evaluating GUI agents in long-horizon tasks, emphasizing long-chain complexity and subtask-level verifiability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent studies have delved into constructing autonomous agents capable of performing complex Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based computer tasks, with the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction. Despite encouraging results, existing efforts mainly focus on short-term interactions and rely on outcome-only verification, thereby limiting their scalability in real-world GUI applications that demand long-horizon task decomposition and execution. In this work, we introduce VeriGUI, a novel verifiable long-chain GUI dataset designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of generalist GUI agents operating in realistic computer environments. Our dataset emphasizes two critical dimensions: (1) long-chain complexity, with tasks decomposed into a sequence of interdependent subtasks spanning hundreds of steps, explicitly designed to allow any subtask to serve as a valid starting point; and (2) subtask-level verifiability, which enables diverse exploration strategies within each subtask, while ensuring that each subtask-level goal remains verifiable and consistent. The dataset consists of GUI task trajectories across both desktop and web, annotated by human experts. Extensive experiments on VeriGUI using various agents with different foundation models reveal significant performance gaps in handling long-horizon tasks, highlighting the need for more robust planning and decision-making capabilities in GUI agents.

SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework, enables computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software through experiential learning and a curriculum of tasks, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents (CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge, we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software. Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks. The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

EvoC2Rust is an automated framework that translates entire C projects to Rust using a skeleton-guided approach, combining rule-based and LLM-based methods to improve syntax, semantics, and safety.  					AI-generated summary 				 Rust's compile-time safety guarantees make it ideal for safety-critical systems, creating demand for translating legacy C codebases to Rust. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based solutions face challenges in meeting code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based solutions often fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting entire C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three evolutionary stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates the function, replacing the corresponding stub placeholder; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates EvoC2Rust's superior performance in project-level C-to-Rust translation. On average, it achieves 17.24% and 14.32% improvements in syntax and semantic accuracy over the LLM-based approaches, along with a 96.79% higher code safety rate than the rule-based tools. At the module level, EvoC2Rust reaches 92.25% compilation and 89.53% test pass rates on industrial projects, even for complex codebases and long functions.

Agent Lightning is a flexible RL framework for training LLMs in various agents, using a hierarchical RL algorithm and decoupling execution from training to handle complex interactions.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent training and deployment.

LaTCoder enhances layout preservation in design-to-code tasks by dividing webpage designs into blocks and using Chain-of-Thought reasoning with MLLMs, achieving significant improvements in metrics and human preference.  					AI-generated summary 				 Converting webpage designs into code (design-to-code) plays a vital role in User Interface (UI) development for front-end developers, bridging the gap between visual design and functional implementation. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in design-to-code tasks, they often fail to accurately preserve the layout during code generation. To this end, we draw inspiration from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in human cognition and propose LaTCoder, a novel approach that enhances layout preservation in webpage design during code generation with Layout-as-Thought (LaT). Specifically, we first introduce a simple yet efficient algorithm to divide the webpage design into image blocks. Next, we prompt MLLMs using a CoTbased approach to generate code for each block. Finally, we apply two assembly strategies-absolute positioning and an MLLM-based method-followed by dynamic selection to determine the optimal output. We evaluate the effectiveness of LaTCoder using multiple backbone MLLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-VL2, Gemini, and GPT-4o) on both a public benchmark and a newly introduced, more challenging benchmark (CC-HARD) that features complex layouts. The experimental results on automatic metrics demonstrate significant improvements. Specifically, TreeBLEU scores increased by 66.67% and MAE decreased by 38% when using DeepSeek-VL2, compared to direct prompting. Moreover, the human preference evaluation results indicate that annotators favor the webpages generated by LaTCoder in over 60% of cases, providing strong evidence of the effectiveness of our method.

"LaTCoder enhances layout preservation in design-to-code tasks by dividing webpage designs into blocks and using Chain-of-Thought reasoning with MLLMs, achieving significant improvements in metrics and human preference.  					AI-generated summary 				 Converting webpage designs into code (design-to-code) plays a vital role in User Interface (UI) development for front-end developers, bridging the gap between visual design and functional implementation. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in design-to-code tasks, they often fail to accurately preserve the layout during code generation. To this end, we draw inspiration from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in human cognition and propose LaTCoder, a novel approach that enhances layout preservation in webpage design during code generation with Layout-as-Thought (LaT). Specifically, we first introduce a simple yet efficient algorithm to divide the webpage design into image blocks. Next, we prompt MLLMs using a CoTbased approach to generate code for each block. Finally, we apply two assembly strategies-absolute positioning and an MLLM-based method-followed by dynamic selection to determine the optimal output. We evaluate the effectiveness of LaTCoder using multiple backbone MLLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-VL2, Gemini, and GPT-4o) on both a public benchmark and a newly introduced, more challenging benchmark (CC-HARD) that features complex layouts. The experimental results on automatic metrics demonstrate significant improvements. Specifically, TreeBLEU scores increased by 66.67% and MAE decreased by 38% when using DeepSeek-VL2, compared to direct prompting. Moreover, the human preference evaluation results indicate that annotators favor the webpages generated by LaTCoder in over 60% of cases, providing strong evidence of the effectiveness of our method."

Transformer-based text-to-image diffusion models show varying degrees of content-style separation in generated artworks, as revealed by cross-attention heatmaps.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Анализ проводился с использованием тепловых карт кросс-внимания, которые позволяют соотнести пиксели сгенерированных изображений с конкретными токенами промпта. Результаты выявили, что во многих случаях токены содержания влияют преимущественно на области, связанные с объектами, в то время как токены стиля воздействуют на фон и текстуры. Это указывает на то, что модели диффузии формируют некоторое внутреннее представление о различии между содержанием и стилем без явного обучения этому.",
