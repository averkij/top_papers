[ 1 9 0 1 0 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r FACTORY: Challenging Human-Verified Prompt Set for Long-Form Factuality Mingda Chen, Yang Li, Xilun Chen, Adina Williams, Gargi Ghosh, Scott Yih Long-form factuality evaluation assesses the ability of models to generate accurate, comprehensive responses to short prompts. Existing benchmarks often lack human verification, leading to potential quality issues. To address this limitation, we introduce FACTORY, large-scale, human-verified prompt set. Developed using model-in-the-loop approach and refined by humans, FACTORY includes challenging prompts that are fact-seeking, answerable, and unambiguous. We conduct human evaluations on 6 state-of-the-art language models using FACTORY and existing datasets. Our results show that FACTORY is challenging benchmark: approximately 40% of the claims made in the responses of SOTA models are not factual, compared to only 10% for other datasets. Our analysis identifies the strengths of FACTORY over prior benchmarks, emphasizing its reliability and the necessity for models to reason across long-tailed facts. Date: August 4, 2025 Correspondence: Mingda Chen at mingdachen@meta.com Scott Yih at scottyih@meta.com Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/FACTORY Long-form factuality aims to assess models abilities to produce comprehensive and accurate responses to relatively short prompts. Existing benchmark prompt sets are typically generated automatically, often missing crucial human verification for quality assurance. While considerable research has been devoted to improving models factuality (Zhang et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024), there is notable gap in developing reliable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce FACTORY1, large-scale, human-verified, and challenging prompt set. We employ model-in-the-loop approach to ensure quality and address the complexities of evaluating long-form generation. Starting with seed topics from Wikipedia, we expand each topic "

FACTORY, a human-verified prompt set, evaluates the factuality of long-form responses from language models, revealing higher factual accuracy compared to existing datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-form factuality evaluation assesses the ability of models to generate accurate, comprehensive responses to short prompts. Existing benchmarks often lack human verification, leading to potential quality issues. To address this limitation, we introduce FACTORY, a large-scale, human-verified prompt set. Developed using a model-in-the-loop approach and refined by humans, FACTORY includes challenging prompts that are fact-seeking, answerable, and unambiguous. We conduct human evaluations on 6 state-of-the-art language models using FACTORY and existing datasets. Our results show that FACTORY is a challenging benchmark: approximately 40% of the claims made in the responses of SOTA models are not factual, compared to only 10% for other datasets. Our analysis identifies the strengths of FACTORY over prior benchmarks, emphasizing its reliability and the necessity for models to reason across long-tailed facts.

"FACTORY, a human-verified prompt set, evaluates the factuality of long-form responses from language models, revealing higher factual accuracy compared to existing datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-form factuality evaluation assesses the ability of models to generate accurate, comprehensive responses to short prompts. Existing benchmarks often lack human verification, leading to potential quality issues. To address this limitation, we introduce FACTORY, a large-scale, human-verified prompt set. Developed using a model-in-the-loop approach and refined by humans, FACTORY includes challenging prompts that are fact-seeking, answerable, and unambiguous. We conduct human evaluations on 6 state-of-the-art language models using FACTORY and existing datasets. Our results show that FACTORY is a challenging benchmark: approximately 40% of the claims made in the responses of SOTA models are not factual, compared to only 10% for other datasets. Our analysis identifies the strengths of FACTORY over prior benchmarks, emphasizing its reliability and the necessity for models to reason across long-tailed facts."
