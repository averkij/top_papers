By implementing the data and AI governance across the life cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly their GenAI enhance the safety and responsibility of systems, effectively mitigating risks of discrimination and protecting against potential reputational or brand-related harm. Ultimately, through this article, we aim to contribute to advancement of the creation and deployment of socially responsible and ethically aligned generative artificial intelligence powered applications. investment technological rtificial Intelligence (AI) is fundamentally reshaping the landscape, driven by rapid innovation, accelerated adoption, and significant financial commitments from industries worldwide. Global in AI technologies is projected to grow, reaching approximately $632 billion by 2028 [3, 4]. Within this broader AI expansion, investment in Generative AI (GenAI) is predicted to reach $26 billion by 2027 [5]. In the long term, the GenAI market valuation is projected to reach an estimated $1.3 trillion by 2032 [1, 6], growing at an average annual growth rate of 36% [7], further emphasizing the profound long term impact and potential. These projections highlight the scale of financial investments and underscore the accelerated pace at which generative technologies are being integrated across many sectors, signaling paradigm shift in our use and interaction with AI in our everyday lives. As AI technologies evolve and their applications widen, the importance of comprehensive data and AI governance becomes increasingly crucial to ensure responsible and ethical development and use of AI [8, 9].implementation of AI and GenAI applications, particularly in fields such as natural language processing, computer vision, and decision support systems, relies on the quality and governance of training data. The emergence of large language models (LLMs), which utilize expansive and diverse training data corpora but are prone to reflecting existing societal prejudices present in the training data, emphasizes the need for comprehensive data and AI governance frameworks [10]. Effective data and AI to address the considerable risks governance is essential associated with these models. to Effective regulatory frameworks are foundational responsible development of generative AI and can help address legal, ethical, and societal impacts while facilitating innovation. Critical elements of these regulatory frameworks include comprehensive legal international collaboration, and adaptive governance [11]. Comprehensive legal frameworks should explicitly address intellectual property rights, accountability, transparency, and safety, ensuring alignment with human-centered principles [12, 13]. infrastructures,regulatory landscape focuses on AI implementation, data privacy, fairness, and transparency. Although these regulations are still evolving, they are already driving organizations across sectors, including financial services [14, 15], healthcare providers [16], legal institutions [9, 19, 20], services [17, 18], and government to navigate emerging compliance requirements. These requirements affect machine learning operations and broader data governance practices. Current AI regula"

Approaches to govern, assess, and quantify bias in machine learning models, particularly large language models, are discussed, emphasizing data and AI governance frameworks for ethical deployment.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we cover approaches to systematically govern, assess and quantify bias across the complete life cycle of machine learning models, from initial development and validation to ongoing production monitoring and guardrail implementation. Building upon our foundational work on the Bias Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models (LLMs) and discuss data and AI governance framework to address Bias, Ethics, Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach discussed in this paper is suitable for practical, real-world applications, enabling rigorous benchmarking of LLMs prior to production deployment, facilitating continuous real-time evaluation, and proactively governing LLM generated responses. By implementing the data and AI governance across the life cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly enhance the safety and responsibility of their GenAI systems, effectively mitigating risks of discrimination and protecting against potential reputational or brand-related harm. Ultimately, through this article, we aim to contribute to advancement of the creation and deployment of socially responsible and ethically aligned generative artificial intelligence powered applications.
