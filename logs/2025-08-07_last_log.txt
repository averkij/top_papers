Text:"Enhancing Vision-Language Model Training with Reinforcement Learning in Synthetic Worlds for Real-World Success George Bredis, Stanislav Dereka, Viacheslav Sinii, Ruslan Rakhimov, Daniil Gavrilov T-Tech Correspondence: g.bredis@tbank.ru 5 2 0 2 6 ] . [ 1 0 8 2 4 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r Abstract Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions capability that current vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL) efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce VisionLanguage Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), lightweight, hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable convergence. Training single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies that generalize widely: +50% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic control), +5% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning), and +2% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and webnavigation benchmarks. Code: https://github.com/corl-team/VL-DAC Introduction Large language models (LLMs) behave like capable singleturn agents in text-only domains, where reinforcement learning (RL) can be applied without man"

Text:"Reasoning Language Models for Root Cause Analysis in 5G Wireless Networks Mohamed Sana, Nicola Piovesan, Antonio De Domenico, Yibin Kang, Haozhe Zhang, Merouane Debbah, Fadhel Ayed Paris Research Center, Huawei Technologies, Boulogne-Billancourt, France Huawei Technologies, China Khalifa University of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, UAE 5 2 0 2 9 2 ] A . [ 1 4 7 9 1 2 . 7 0 5 2 : r AbstractRoot Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains challenging task due to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In this work, we propose lightweight framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs1, curated dataset of annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this issue, we propose two-stage training methodology that combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes series of RCA models to integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over state-of-the-art reasoning and nonreasoning models, including strong generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the promise of domainadapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and explainable RCA in network operation and management. I. INTRODUCTION Modern mobile networks are complex, large-scale systems that must maintain high level of performance and reliability. Despite extensive monitoring and control mechanisms, faults inevitably arise, ranging from hardware failures to software miss-configurations. While fault detection highlights symptoms of network issues, effective "

A lightweight, hyperparameter-free RL algorithm, VL-DAC, enables VLMs to learn generalized policies from inexpensive simulators, improving performance on real-world benchmarks without sacrificing image understanding accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL) efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight, hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning), and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and web-navigation benchmarks.

A lightweight framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) with TeleLogs dataset and a two-stage training methodology improves Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks by enhancing interpretability and reasoning quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and explainable RCA in network operation and management.

"A lightweight framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) with TeleLogs dataset and a two-stage training methodology improves Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks by enhancing interpretability and reasoning quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and explainable RCA in network operation and management."

MiDashengLM is an open audio-language model using general audio captions for efficient and comprehensive audio understanding, offering faster processing and higher throughput compared to existing models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current approaches for large audio language models (LALMs) often rely on closed data sources or proprietary models, limiting their generalization and accessibility. This paper introduces MiDashengLM, a novel open audio-language model designed for efficient and comprehensive audio understanding through the use of general audio captions using our novel ACAVCaps training dataset. MiDashengLM exclusively relies on publicly available pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, ensuring full transparency and reproducibility. At its core, MiDashengLM integrates Dasheng, an open-source audio encoder, specifically engineered to process diverse auditory information effectively. Unlike previous works primarily focused on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) based audio-text alignment, our strategy centers on general audio captions, fusing speech, sound and music information into one textual representation, enabling a holistic textual representation of complex audio scenes. Lastly, MiDashengLM provides an up to 4x speedup in terms of time-to-first-token (TTFT) and up to 20x higher throughput than comparable models. Checkpoints are available online at https://huggingface.co/mispeech/midashenglm-7b and https://github.com/xiaomi-research/dasheng-lm.
