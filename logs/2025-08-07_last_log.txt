INTRODUCTION End-to-end autonomous driving has attracted increasing attention due to recent progress in learning based perception and planning systems, including object detection [1] [3], multi-object tracking [4], [5], online mapping [6][9], prediction [10][13] and planning [14][16]. These advances have enabled the learning of driving policies directly from raw sensor inputs, bypassing the need for hand-crafted rules. Two-stage end-to-end frameworks decompose the driving task into intermediate perception and planning modules, typically leveraging structured representations such as birdseye view (BEV) maps or object lists. This design enhances interpretability and training stability, but may suffer from sub-optimal performance due to error propagation between stages and limited capacity for joint optimization. While 1 Zhigang Sun, Yiru Wang, Anqing Jiang, Shuo Wang, Yu Gao, Yuwen Heng, Shouyi Zhang, An He, Shichen Tang, Hao Sun are with Bosch Corporate Research, Bosch (China) Investment Ltd., Shanghai, China. * means equal contribution 2 Jinhao Chai, Zichong Gu are with School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China 3 Hao Jiang is with Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China 4 Wang Jijun, is with AIR, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China 5 Lavdim Halilaj, Juergen Luettin are with Robert Bosch GmbH 6 represents corresponding author, yiru.wang@cn.bosch.com Fig. 1. Semantic Raster Image Fusion map-informed prediction and planning have shown notable benefits by using high-definition (HD) maps to provide structural context, their effectiveness often diminishes in scenarios where online maps are incomplete, noisy, or misaligned. Such limitations can significantly affect downstream tasks like motion prediction and planning, particularly in dynamic or previously unseen environments. Moreover, strict reliance on pre-defined map structures can hinder generalization and robustness in real-world where map inaccuracies are inevitable. To address these challenges, we propose online HD map diffusion, novel framework that enhances the robustness of map-informed prediction under online mapping conditions. Rather than treating the map as fixed input, map diffusion introduces learnable mechanism that iteratively refines and denoises online map representations via diffusion-based generative process. This approach allows the model to adaptively recover reliable map features, even in the presence of uncertainty or noise, thereby improving the quality of trajectory prediction and downstream planning. By bridging the gap between static HD maps and dynamic online mapping, online HD map diffusion offers resilient and scalable solution for safe and efficient autonomous driving. In contrast, one-stage end-to-end approaches [17][21] directly regress control commands or trajectories from raw sensor inputs, enabling full-system differentiability and potentially higher performance. However, they often face challenges related to interpretability, data efficiency, and deployment in safety-critical settings. To combine the advantages of both paradigms, we propose semantic raster BEV fusion framework that incorporates intermediate representations within an end-to-end trainable architecture. This design retains the interpretability and structure of two-stage pipelines while enabling the global optimization benefits of one-stage systems. Such integration has shown promise Fig. 2. DiffSemanticFusion Overview: Sparse Perception utilizes Sparse4D [25] to extract bounding boxes of dynamic objects and map elements. Dense Perception utilizes LSS [26] and BEVDet [1] to extract BEV features. Vectorized Graph utilizes SemanticFormer [27] to extract graph information. Fusion fuses heterogeneous representations to unified space and Diffusion Planner serves as trajectories decoder. in achieving both high performance and reliable decisionmaking in complex driving scenarios. The main contributions are: We propose the online HD map diffusion module, which improves the robustness of online HD maps under noisy or incomplete conditions, enhancing downstream prediction and planning performance. We design semantic raster BEV fusion architecture that combines raster-based, graph-based map and BEVfeature representations in BEV space, leveraging their complementary strengths for more stable and informative scene understanding. We validate our method on two tasks: prediction on nuScenes [22] and planning oriented end-to-end autonomous driving in NAVSIM [23]. Both achieve SOTA performance. DiffSemanticFusion improves online HD map informed QCNet [24"

DiffSemanticFusion enhances autonomous driving by fusing semantic raster and graph-based representations using a map diffusion module, improving trajectory prediction and end-to-end driving performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition, extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance performance. All artifacts are available at https://github.com/SunZhigang7/DiffSemanticFusion.

HarmonyGuard is a multi-agent framework that enhances policy compliance and task completion in web environments by adaptively updating security policies and optimizing dual objectives of safety and utility.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios, lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance across all tasks. Our project is available here: https://github.com/YurunChen/HarmonyGuard.
