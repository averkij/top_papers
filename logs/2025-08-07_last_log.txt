[ 1 9 5 1 3 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r AbstractDrug toxicity remains major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale. To address this issue, we propose CoTox, novel framework that integrates LLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and Gene Ontology (GO) terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the models reasoning ability and improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with physiological respon"

Text:"5 2 0 2 4 2 ] . [ 1 4 9 6 2 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r Efficient Agents: Building Effective Agents While Reducing CostThe remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , novel agent framework that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains 96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in 28.4% improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility and sustainability of AI-driven solutions. Date: August 6, 2025 Correspondence: Wangchunshu Zhou at zhouwangchunshu@oppo.com; He Zhu at zhuhe@oppo.com Code: https://github.com/OPPO-PersonalAI/OAgentsThe ever-increasing reasoning and creation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened up broad prospect for real-world applications. Researchers have developed numerous LLM-driven agent systems [110] and created large number of fascinating products capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks. However, this progress mirrors familiar trajectory in NLP research: from BERT [11] to ChatGPT [12], researchers consistently prioritize scaling up models to achieve breakthrough capabilities [13, 14], only later turning to optimize efficiency, cost, and environmental impact [15, 16]. This pattern has given rise to the critical subfield of efficient NLP, where researchers balance performance with practical constraints like inference latency, energy consumption, and economic viability. We argue that agent research has now reached similar inflection point. While increasingly sophisticated agent architectures can solve remarkably complex problems, their costs scale prohibitively. Industry deployments reveal this tension starkly: cutting-edge agent products (e.g., DeepResearch [17], Manus [18]) demonstrate impressive capabilities but suffer from exorbitant operating costs due to explosive LLM call overhead. Some 1 Figure 1 Evaluation of effectiveness and efficiency in agent system components. We adopt cost-of-pass as the metric to evaluate. We develop Efficient Agents that optimizes cost while maintaining accuracy. systems require hundreds of API calls per task, rendering them economically unsustainable despite their technical brilliance. This creates fundamental bottleneck for real-world adoption, limiting both the scalability of applications and the accessibility of AI advancements. Our work presents the first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern agent systems. Through rigorous empirical analysis, we investigate 3 research questions: (1) How much complexity do agentic tasks truly require? (2) When do additional modules yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the design of task-adaptive agent frameworks? By dissecting these relationships across the framework, we provide actionable insights for both researchers and practitioners. We conduct an empirical study on the GAIA benchmark [19] focusing on the efficiency-performance trade-off of agent systems by evaluating the impact of: (1) the choice of LLM backbones; (2) the designs of agent frameworks including planning, tool using, and memory; (3) test-time scaling and ensemble strategies. We adopt the cost-of-pass [20] metric to compare and analyze the impact of different design choices on the efficiency-performance trade-off of LLM-based agents, as illustrated in Figure 1. Based on the insight obtained in the aforementioned empirical study, we introduce Efficient Agents , an agent framework optimized for achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off that achieves new state-of-the-art on the cost-of-pass metric on the GAIA benchmark. Specifically, 96.7% of the performance of OWL [21], an open-source agent framework that achieves great performance on the GAIA benchmark, while reducing the cost from $0.398 to $0.228, leading to relative improvement of 28.4% in terms of cost-of-pass. Our contribution could be summarized as follows: We thoroughly analyze and summarize the factors that cause significant economic overhead in generic LLM-based agent system. We propose Efficient Agents , an efficient agent system where each component is selected based on prior analytical results, optimizing for efficiency while maintaining high effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that Efficient Agents achieves 96.7% of the performance of OWL while reducing costs by 28.4%."

CoTox, a framework integrating LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning, enhances multi-toxicity prediction by incorporating chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology terms, improving interpretability and predictive performance in drug development.  					AI-generated summary 				 Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale. To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO) terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support early-stage drug safety assessment.

OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source transformer models using DAPT and LoRA, achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse biomedical NER benchmarks with high efficiency and low computational cost.  					AI-generated summary 				 Named-entity recognition (NER) is fundamental to extracting structured information from the >80% of healthcare data that resides in unstructured clinical notes and biomedical literature. Despite recent advances with large language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse entity types while maintaining computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. We introduce OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source, domain-adapted transformer models that combine lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT) with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach performs cost-effective DAPT on a 350k-passage corpus compiled from ethically sourced, publicly available research repositories and de-identified clinical notes (PubMed, arXiv, and MIMIC-III) using DeBERTa-v3, PubMedBERT, and BioELECTRA backbones. This is followed by task-specific fine-tuning with LoRA, which updates less than 1.5% of model parameters. We evaluate our models on 12 established biomedical NER benchmarks spanning chemicals, diseases, genes, and species. OpenMed NER achieves new state-of-the-art micro-F1 scores on 10 of these 12 datasets, with substantial gains across diverse entity types. Our models advance the state-of-the-art on foundational disease and chemical benchmarks (e.g., BC5CDR-Disease, +2.70 pp), while delivering even larger improvements of over 5.3 and 9.7 percentage points on more specialized gene and clinical cell line corpora. This work demonstrates that strategically adapted open-source models can surpass closed-source solutions. This performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency: training completes in under 12 hours on a single GPU with a low carbon footprint (< 1.2 kg CO2e), producing permissively licensed, open-source checkpoints designed to help practitioners facilitate compliance with emerging data protection and AI regulations, such as the EU AI Act.

A study on the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in LLM-driven agent systems identifies optimal agent framework design to reduce costs while maintaining performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains 96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while reducing operational costs from 0.398 to 0.228, resulting in a 28.4% improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.
