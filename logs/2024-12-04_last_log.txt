Text:"Generating Low-code Complete Workflow via Task Decomposition and RAG Orlando Marquez Ayala ServiceNow orlando.marquez@servicenow.com Patrice Bechard ServiceNow patrice.bechard@servicenow.com 4 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 1 9 3 2 0 0 . 2 1 4 2 : r AbstractAI technologies are moving rapidly from research to production. With the popularity of Foundation Models (FMs) that generate text, images, and video, AI-based systems are increasing their complexity. Compared to traditional AI-based software, systems employing FMs, or GenAI-based systems, are more difficult to design due to their scale and versatility. This makes it necessary to document best practices, known as design patterns in software engineering, that can be used across GenAI applications. Our first contribution is to formalize two techniques, Task Decomposition and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), as design patterns for GenAI-based systems. We discuss their tradeoffs in terms of software quality attributes and comment on alternative approaches. We recommend to AI practitioners to consider these techniques not only from scientific perspective but also from the standpoint of desired engineering properties such as flexibility, maintainability, safety, and security. As second contribution, we describe our industry experience applying Task Decomposition and RAG to build complex real-world GenAI application for enterprise users: Workflow Generation. The task of generating workflows entails generating specific plan using data from the system environment, taking as input user requirement. As these two patterns affect the entire AI development cycle, we explain how they impacted the dataset creation, model training, model evaluation, and deployment phases.

Motion control is crucial for generating expressive and compelling video content; however, most existing video generation models rely mainly on text prompts for control, which struggle to capture the nuances of dynamic actions and temporal compositions. To this end, we train a video generation model conditioned on spatio-temporally sparse or dense motion trajectories. In contrast to prior motion conditioning work, this flexible representation can encode any number of trajectories, object-specific or global scene motion, and temporally sparse motion; due to its flexibility we refer to this conditioning as motion prompts. While users may directly specify sparse trajectories, we also show how to translate high-level user requests into detailed, semi-dense motion prompts, a process we term motion prompt expansion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through various applications, including camera and object motion control, "interacting" with an image, motion transfer, and image editing. Our results showcase emergent behaviors, such as realistic physics, suggesting the potential of motion prompts for probing video models and interacting with future generative world models. Finally, we evaluate quantitatively, conduct a human study, and demonstrate strong performance. Video results are available on our webpage: https://motion-prompting.github.io/

Our first contribution is to formalize two techniques, Task Decomposition and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), as design patterns for GenAI-based systems. We discuss their trade-offs in terms of software quality attributes and comment on alternative approaches. We recommend to AI practitioners to consider these techniques not only from a scientific perspective but also from the standpoint of desired engineering properties such as flexibility, maintainability, safety, and security. As a second contribution, we describe our industry experience applying Task Decomposition and RAG to build a complex real-world GenAI application for enterprise users: Workflow Generation. The task of generating workflows entails generating a specific plan using data from the system environment, taking as input a user requirement. As these two patterns affect the entire AI development cycle, we explain how they impacted the dataset creation, model training, model evaluation, and deployment phases.

  "desc": "Статья посвящена формализации двух техник - декомпозиции задач и генерации с дополнением извлечением информации (RAG) - как паттернов проектирования для систем на основе генеративного ИИ. Авторы обсуждают компромиссы этих паттернов с точки зрения атрибутов качества программного обеспечения и рекомендуют рассматривать их не только с научной точки зрения, но и с позиции желаемых инженерных свойств. В статье также описывается опыт применения этих паттернов для создания сложного приложения генеративного ИИ для корпоративных пользователей - генерации рабочих процессов. Авторы объясняют, как эти паттерны повлияли на весь цикл разработки ИИ, включая создание датасетов, обучение и оценку моделей, а также развертывание.",

"AI technologies are moving rapidly from research to production. With the popularity of Foundation Models (FMs) that generate text, images, and video, AI-based systems are increasing their complexity. Compared to traditional AI-based software, systems employing FMs, or GenAI-based systems, are more difficult to design due to their scale and versatility. This makes it necessary to document best practices, known as design patterns in software engineering, that can be used across GenAI applications. Our first contribution is to formalize two techniques, Task Decomposition and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), as design patterns for GenAI-based systems.
