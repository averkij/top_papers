Text:"Direct Discriminative Optimization: Your Likelihood-Based Visual Generative Model is Secretly GAN Discriminator Kaiwen Zheng 1 2 Yongxin Chen 1 Huayu Chen 2 Guande He 3 Ming-Yu Liu 1 Jun Zhu 2 Qinsheng Zhang 1 https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/ddo/ 5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 3 0 1 1 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r Abstract While likelihood-based generative models, particularly diffusion and autoregressive models, have achieved remarkable fidelity in visual generation, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) objective inherently suffers from mode-covering tendency that limits the generation quality under limited model capacity. In this work, we propose Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO) as unified framework that bridges likelihood-based generative training and the GAN objective to bypass this fundamental constraint. Our key insight is to parameterize discriminator implicitly using the likelihood ratio between learnable target model and fixed reference model, drawing parallels with the philosophy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike GANs, this parameterization eliminates the need for joint training of generator and discriminator networks, allowing for direct, efficient, and effective finetuning of well-trained model to its full potential beyond the limits of MLE. DDO can be performed iteratively in self-play manner for progressive model refinement, with each round requiring less than 1% of pretraining epochs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DDO by significantly advancing the previous SOTA diffusion model EDM, reducing FID scores from 1.79/1.58 to new records of 1.30/0.97 on CIFAR-10/ImageNet-64 datasets, and by consistently improving both guidance-free and CFG-enhanced FIDs of visual autoregressive models on ImageNet 256256. 1.

Human readers can efficiently comprehend scrambled words, a phenomenon known as Typoglycemia, primarily by relying on word form; if word form alone is insufficient, they further utilize contextual cues for interpretation. While advanced large language models (LLMs) exhibit similar abilities, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this, we conduct controlled experiments to analyze the roles of word form and contextual information in semantic reconstruction and examine LLM attention patterns. Specifically, we first propose SemRecScore, a reliable metric to quantify the degree of semantic reconstruction, and validate its effectiveness. Using this metric, we study how word form and contextual information influence LLMs' semantic reconstruction ability, identifying word form as the core factor in this process. Furthermore, we analyze how LLMs utilize word form and find that they rely on specialized attention heads to extract and process word form information, with this mechanism remaining stable across varying levels of word scrambling. This distinction between LLMs' fixed attention patterns primarily focused on word form and human readers' adaptive strategy in balancing word form and contextual information provides insights into enhancing LLM performance by incorporating human-like, context-aware mechanisms.

Generating ultra-long sequences with large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly crucial but remains a highly time-intensive task, particularly for sequences up to 100K tokens. While traditional speculative decoding methods exist, simply extending their generation limits fails to accelerate the process and can be detrimental. Through an in-depth analysis, we identify three major challenges hindering efficient generation: frequent model reloading, dynamic key-value (KV) management and repetitive generation. To address these issues, we introduce TOKENSWIFT, a novel framework designed to substantially accelerate the generation process of ultra-long sequences while maintaining the target model's inherent quality. Experimental results demonstrate that TOKENSWIFT achieves over 3 times speedup across models of varying scales (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B) and architectures (MHA, GQA). This acceleration translates to hours of time savings for ultra-long sequence generation, establishing TOKENSWIFT as a scalable and effective solution at unprecedented lengths.

Existing pretraining data mixing methods for large language models (LLMs) typically follow a domain-wise methodology, a top-down process that first determines domain weights and then performs uniform data sampling across each domain. However, these approaches neglect significant inter-domain overlaps and commonalities, failing to control the global diversity of the constructed training dataset. Further, uniform sampling within domains ignores fine-grained sample-specific features, potentially leading to suboptimal data distribution. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel sample-wise data mixture approach based on a bottom-up paradigm. This method performs global cross-domain sampling by systematically evaluating the quality and diversity of each sample, thereby dynamically determining the optimal domain distribution. Comprehensive experiments across multiple downstream tasks and perplexity assessments demonstrate that SampleMix surpasses existing domain-based methods. Meanwhile, SampleMix requires 1.4x to 2.1x training steps to achieves the baselines' performance, highlighting the substantial potential of SampleMix to optimize pre-training data.

"Existing pretraining data mixing methods for large language models (LLMs) typically follow a domain-wise methodology, a top-down process that first determines domain weights and then performs uniform data sampling across each domain. However, these approaches neglect significant inter-domain overlaps and commonalities, failing to control the global diversity of the constructed training dataset. Further, uniform sampling within domains ignores fine-grained sample-specific features, potentially leading to suboptimal data distribution. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel sample-wise data mixture approach based on a bottom-up paradigm. This method performs global cross-domain sampling by systematically evaluating the quality and diversity of each sample, thereby dynamically determining the optimal domain distribution. Comprehensive experiments across multiple downstream tasks and perplexity assessments demonstrate that SampleMix surpasses existing domain-based methods. Meanwhile, SampleMix requires 1.4x to 2.1x training steps to achieves the baselines' performance, highlighting the substantial potential of SampleMix to optimize pre-training data."

While likelihood-based generative models, particularly diffusion and autoregressive models, have achieved remarkable fidelity in visual generation, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) objective inherently suffers from a mode-covering tendency that limits the generation quality under limited model capacity. In this work, we propose Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO) as a unified framework that bridges likelihood-based generative training and the GAN objective to bypass this fundamental constraint. Our key insight is to parameterize a discriminator implicitly using the likelihood ratio between a learnable target model and a fixed reference model, drawing parallels with the philosophy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike GANs, this parameterization eliminates the need for joint training of generator and discriminator networks, allowing for direct, efficient, and effective finetuning of a well-trained model to its full potential beyond the limits of MLE. DDO can be performed iteratively in a self-play manner for progressive model refinement, with each round requiring less than 1% of pretraining epochs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DDO by significantly advancing the previous SOTA diffusion model EDM, reducing FID scores from 1.79/1.58 to new records of 1.30/0.97 on CIFAR-10/ImageNet-64 datasets, and by consistently improving both guidance-free and CFG-enhanced FIDs of visual autoregressive models on ImageNet 256times256.
