Specifically, we draw inspiration from recent findings showing that compression efficiency (i.e., the normalized loss) of diverse models on certain text correlates strongly with their downstream performance, when the text domain aligns with the downstream benchmarks (Huang et al., 2024). Building on this observation, we hypothesize that data on which model losses are predictive of downstream abilities also contribute effectively to learning. To leverage this insight, we introduce emphpredictive data selection (PRESELECT), lightweight and efficient data selection method that requires training and deploying only fastText-based scorer. Through comprehensive experiments with 1B and 3B parameter models, we demonstrate that models trained on 30B tokens selected with PRESELECT surpass the performance of the vanilla baseline trained on 300B tokens, achieving 10x reduction in compute requirements. Furthermore, PRESELECT significantly outperforms other competitive data selection baselines, such as DCLM and FineWebEdu on scale of 3B models trained on 100B tokens. We open-source our trained data selection scorer along with the curated datasets at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/PreSelect. 1. Introduction Large language model (LLM) pre-training typically requires training on huge data source such as web crawl data where the existence of low-quality data leads to slow scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2023). Given the *Equal contribution 1HKUST 2Vivo AI Lab. Correspondence to: Kashun Shum <ksshumab@connect.ust.hk>, Junxian He <junxianh@cse.ust.hk>. 1 Figure 1: PRESELECT outperforms random selection by an average of 3.1% accuracy across 15 downstream benchmarks and achieves 10x reduction in compute requirements on the scale of 1B models using RefinedWeb corpus. growing available token budget and limited training budget nowadays, data selection has become standard step in the pre-training stage. This step has played critical role in enhancing data quality and optimizing training efficiency during the development of various LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023b; DeepSeek-AI, 2024). While previous practices often rely on human heuristics such as pre-defined rules and domain classification to filter data (Penedo et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024), in this work we aim to directly identify data that could contribute effectively to learning various abilities. We are inspired by the belief that compression represents intelligence and the corresponding empirical finding recently (Huang et al., 2024), that the compression efficiency (i.e., the normalized loss)1 of series of models on certain raw text, strongly correlates with their downstream benchmark performance, when the text data aligns with the benchmark domains. For example, Huang et al. (2024) observed that model losses on raw GitHub code exhibit an almost linear correlation with performance on various cod1For given model, the lossless compression efficiency, such as bits per character on certain data, is equal to the normalized loss on that data (Deletang et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024). See 2.1 for further details. Predictive Data Selection: The Data That Predicts Is the Data That Teaches Figure 2: The overall framework of PRESELECT. It first samples subset of pre-training data for computing the predictive strength score of each document (2.2). Then fastText-based scorer is trained based on the identified positive data and negative data. Finally the fastText-based scorer is trained to enable scalable data selection. ing tasks, whereas model losses on Common Crawl data are more indicative of performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. These insights suggest that compression efficiency on certain data is more reflective of models intelligence than that on other data. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that data on which compression more effectively represents intelligence also facilitates the learning of that respective intelligence more effectively. Building on this hypothesis, we first define the predictive strength of given text to quantify how well the compression efficiency on it correlates with the models ability, then, we introduce predicative data selection (PRESELECT), data selection method based on the datas predictive strength. Different from previous works that try to quantify the pretraining data influence requiring controlled training (Yu et al., 2024; Engstrom et al., 2024), our approach is extremely lightweight, and only utilizes open pretrained models in the wild without training any deep models in the process. After collecting small seed dataset, fastText (Joulin et al., 2017) classifier is trained to enable scalable data selection over large corpus. Our approach shares similar intuition with (Thrush et al., 2024), while we are motivated independently by Huang et al. (2024). However, this work differs from Thrush et al. (2024) in several key aspects: (1) While they compute perplexity correlations for data domains (e.g., wikipedia.com) and select domains, our method operates at much finer granularity, directly operating on and selecting individual documents. As we will demonstrate in 3.4 and 4.3, this finer granularity leads to significant differences in the selected data and, consequently, in the final results; (2) They performed very limited experiments with 160M-size model and compared with several baselines on limited benchmarks, while we train models with up to 3B parameters on up to 100B tokens and evaluate on 17 diverse benchmarks, more realistic scale in typical pretraining setting. Experimental results show that PRESELECT naturally selects high-quality data, achieving an average of 5.3% absolute improvement over random selection at 1B scale and outperforms current state-of-the-art data selection methods by 2.2% absolutely on tasks across understanding, knowledge, math, and code. PRESELECT also show its adaptability to different model architectures (Llama (Touvron et al., 2023a) and Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023)), as well as different pre-training corpora a"

Language model pretraining involves training on extensive corpora, where data quality plays a pivotal role. In this work, we aim to directly estimate the contribution of data during pretraining and select pretraining data in an efficient manner. Specifically, we draw inspiration from recent findings showing that compression efficiency (i.e., the normalized loss) of diverse models on certain text correlates strongly with their downstream performance, when the text domain aligns with the downstream benchmark (Huang et al., 2024). Building on this observation, we hypothesize that data on which model losses are predictive of downstream abilities also contribute effectively to learning. To leverage this insight, we introduce data selection based on data's Predictive strength (Preselect), a lightweight and efficient data selection method that requires training and deploying only a fastText-based scorer. Through comprehensive experiments with 1B and 3B parameter models, we demonstrate that models trained on 30B tokens selected with PreSelect surpasses the performance of a vanilla baseline trained on 300B tokens, achieving a 10x reduction in compute requirements. Furthermore, PreSelect significantly outperforms other competitive data selection baselines, such as DCLM and FineWeb-Edu on a scale of 3B models trained on 100B tokens. We open-source our trained data selection scorer along with the curated datasets at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/PreSelect.

Метод основан на гипотезе, что данные, на которых потери модели предсказывают ее способности в downstream задачах, эффективно способствуют обучению. PreSelect использует легковесный скорер на основе fastText для оценки 'предсказательной силы' данных. Эксперименты показывают, что модели, обученные на 30 миллиардах токенов, отобранных с помощью PreSelect, превосходят базовые модели, обученные на 300 миллиардах токенов, что приводит к 10-кратному сокращению вычислительных затрат.",
