Text:"5 2 0 2 6 2 ] . [ 1 0 9 8 8 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r February 27, 2025 From Hours to Minutes: Lossless Acceleration of Ultra Long Sequence Generation up to 100K Tokens Tong Wu , Junzhe Shen , Zixia Jia , Yuxuan Wang and Zilong Zheng (cid:0) NLCo Lab, BIGAI LUMIA Lab, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Equal contribution. Generating ultra-long sequences with large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly crucial but remains highly time-intensive task, particularly for sequences up to 100K tokens. While traditional speculative decoding methods exist, simply extending their generation limits fails to accelerate the process and can be detrimental. Through an in-depth analysis, we identify three major challenges hindering efficient generation: frequent model reloading, dynamic key-value (KV) management and repetitive generation. To address these issues, we introduce TOKENSWIFT, novel framework designed to substantially accelerate the generation process of ultra-long sequences while maintaining the target models inherent quality. Experimental results demonstrate that TOKENSWIFT achieves over 3ˆ speedup across models of varying scales (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B) and architectures (MHA, GQA). This acceleration translates to hours of time savings for ultra-long sequence generation, establishing TOKENSWIFT as scalable and effective solution at unprecedented lengths. Code can be found at github.com/bigai-nlco/TokenSwift. Figure 1. Comparison of the time taken to generate 100K tokens using autoregressive (AR) and TOKENSWIFT with prefix length of 4096 on LLaMA3.1-8b. As seen, TOKENSWIFT accelerates the AR process from nearly 5 hours to just 90 minutes. 1. Introduction Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), amplified by their long context capacities (Wu et al., 2024; Ding et al., 2024), have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in intricate reasoning (Jaech et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025), agentic thinking (Shinn et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a), and creative writing (W"

Recent advancements in music generation have garnered significant attention, yet existing approaches face critical limitations. Some current generative models can only synthesize either the vocal track or the accompaniment track. While some models can generate combined vocal and accompaniment, they typically rely on meticulously designed multi-stage cascading architectures and intricate data pipelines, hindering scalability. Additionally, most systems are restricted to generating short musical segments rather than full-length songs. Furthermore, widely used language model-based methods suffer from slow inference speeds. To address these challenges, we propose DiffRhythm, the first latent diffusion-based song generation model capable of synthesizing complete songs with both vocal and accompaniment for durations of up to 4m45s in only ten seconds, maintaining high musicality and intelligibility. Despite its remarkable capabilities, DiffRhythm is designed to be simple and elegant: it eliminates the need for complex data preparation, employs a straightforward model structure, and requires only lyrics and a style prompt during inference. Additionally, its non-autoregressive structure ensures fast inference speeds. This simplicity guarantees the scalability of DiffRhythm. Moreover, we release the complete training code along with the pre-trained model on large-scale data to promote reproducibility and further research.

Generating ultra-long sequences with large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly crucial but remains a highly time-intensive task, particularly for sequences up to 100K tokens. While traditional speculative decoding methods exist, simply extending their generation limits fails to accelerate the process and can be detrimental. Through an in-depth analysis, we identify three major challenges hindering efficient generation: frequent model reloading, dynamic key-value (KV) management and repetitive generation. To address these issues, we introduce TOKENSWIFT, a novel framework designed to substantially accelerate the generation process of ultra-long sequences while maintaining the target model's inherent quality. Experimental results demonstrate that TOKENSWIFT achieves over 3 times speedup across models of varying scales (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B) and architectures (MHA, GQA). This acceleration translates to hours of time savings for ultra-long sequence generation, establishing TOKENSWIFT as a scalable and effective solution at unprecedented lengths.

Room layout estimation from multiple-perspective images is poorly investigated due to the complexities that emerge from multi-view geometry, which requires muti-step solutions such as camera intrinsic and extrinsic estimation, image matching, and triangulation. However, in 3D reconstruction, the advancement of recent 3D foundation models such as DUSt3R has shifted the paradigm from the traditional multi-step structure-from-motion process to an end-to-end single-step approach. To this end, we introduce Plane-DUSt3R, a novel method for multi-view room layout estimation leveraging the 3D foundation model DUSt3R. Plane-DUSt3R incorporates the DUSt3R framework and fine-tunes on a room layout dataset (Structure3D) with a modified objective to estimate structural planes. By generating uniform and parsimonious results, Plane-DUSt3R enables room layout estimation with only a single post-processing step and 2D detection results. Unlike previous methods that rely on single-perspective or panorama image, Plane-DUSt3R extends the setting to handle multiple-perspective images. Moreover, it offers a streamlined, end-to-end solution that simplifies the process and reduces error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that Plane-DUSt3R not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the synthetic dataset but also proves robust and effective on in the wild data with different image styles such as cartoon.Our code is available at: https://github.com/justacar/Plane-DUSt3R
