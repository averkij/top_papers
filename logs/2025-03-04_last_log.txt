Text:"5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 3 4 7 1 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r Phi-4-Mini Technical Report: Compact yet Powerful Multimodal Language Models via Mixture-of-LoRAs MicrosoftWe introduce Phi-4-Mini and Phi-4-Multimodal, compact yet highly capable language and multimodal models. Phi-4-Mini is 3.8-billion-parameter language model trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly outperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the performance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex reasoning. This achievement is driven by carefully curated synthetic data recipe emphasizing highquality math and coding datasets. Compared to its predecessor, Phi-3.5-Mini, Phi-4-Mini features an expanded vocabulary size of 200K tokens to better support multilingual applications, as well as group query attention for more efficient long-sequence generation. Phi-4-Multimodal is multimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input modalities into single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages LoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes combining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks first in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the speech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal supports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and (speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language models on wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train Phi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities.1. Despite its compact 3.8-billion-parameter size, this experimental version achieves reasoning performance on par with or surpassing significantly larger models, including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.The Phi family of models [AJA+24, AAB+24] have shown that carefully curated and synthesized data enables Small Language Models (SLMs) to achieve highly competitive performance despite having significantly smaller number of parameters. These models demonstrate comparable results to much larger models. Building on the success of the Phi family of language models, we extend their capabilities to handle additional modalities such as vision and audio, achieving significant progress akin to private models like GPT [HLG+24], Claude [Ant24], and Gemini [TGL+24]. In this report, we introduce Phi-4-Multimodal, unified multimodal SLM that supports multiple inference modes combining various modalities (e.g., text-only, text + image, speech/audio, speech + image) within single model checkpoint. Phi-4-Multimodal employs novel mixture of LoRAs technique, enabling multimodal capabilities by integrating modality-specific LoRAs while keeping the base language model entirely frozen. Our findings show this technique outperforms existing approaches (e.g., cross-attention designs [ADL+22, AI23]) and achieves comparable performance to fully fine-tuned hanyh@microsoft.com, youki@microsoft.com 1Please note that reasoning-enhanced Phi-4-Mini is separate model and currently in preview stage and will not be released concurrently with Phi-4-Mini and Phi-4-Multimodal. 1 models on multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, the design of Phi-4-Multimodal is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new LoRAs to support additional modalities without impacting existing ones. Our training process comprises multiple stages, including language training (encompassing both pretraining and post-training) and then expansion of the language backbone to vision and speech/audio modalities. For the language model, we train Phi-4-Mini using high-quality, reasoning-rich text data. Notably, we include curated, high-quality code datasets to enhance performance on coding tasks. Once the language model training is complete, we freeze the language model and implement our Mixture of LoRAs technique to proceed with the multimodal training stage. Specifically, we train two additional LoRA modules alongside modality-specific encoders and projectors to enable vision-related tasks (e.g., vision-language and vision-speech) and speech/audio-related tasks (e.g., speech-language). Both of them contain pretraining and post-training stages for modality alignment and instruction finetuning, respectively. We also explore the reasoning potential of Phi-4-Mini to create compact yet powerful model that rivals substantially larger state-of-the-art reasoning systems, such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B [GYZ+25]. The key contributions of this model are listed below. 1. Unified Multi-Modality Support: In contrast to existing methods [Tea25b, CWW+24] that employ separate models for different modalities, Phi-4-Multimodal is designed as unified model capable of efficiently handling multiple modality scenarios. By leveraging the Mixture of LoRAs [HSW+22], Phi-4-Multimodal extends multimodal capabilities while minimizing interference between modalities. This approach enables seamless integration and ensures consistent performance across tasks involving text, images, and speech/audio. 2. Remarkable Language Performance for the size: The language models achieve state-ofIt the-art performance in natural language understanding and generation for its size category. demonstrates exceptional reasoning and mathematical capabilities, making it well-suited for complex problem-solving and knowledge-based tasks. 3. Outstanding Code Understanding and Generation for the size: The language models achieve state-of-the-art performance on code-related tasks within its size category. The model excels at tasks such as code synthesis, debugging, and documentation generation, empowering developers and aiding in software engineering workflows. 4. Superior Multi-Modal Capabilities for the size: The model delivers state-of-the-art performance across multi-modal tasks for its size category, demonstrating robust integration of diverse data types. This includes tasks that involve combining images with text and speech modalities, enabling multi-modal reasoning. 5. Exceptional Speech and Audio Performance: The model achieves strong performance especially on multilingual speech recognition and translation tasks, and is the first open-sourced model with speech summarization capability. 6. Enhanced Reasoning Capabilities: The reasoning-optimized version of Phi-4-Mini demonstrates superior reasoning abilities for model in i"

Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in Large Reasoning Models like OpenAI o1 learns from feedback on its answers, which is especially useful in applications when fine-tuning data is scarce. Recent open-source work like DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward is one key direction in reproducing o1. While the R1-style model has demonstrated success in language models, its application in multi-modal domains remains under-explored. This work introduces Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT), which further extends the application areas of RFT on visual tasks. Specifically, Visual-RFT first uses Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multiple responses containing reasoning tokens and final answers for each input, and then uses our proposed visual perception verifiable reward functions to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We design different verifiable reward functions for different perception tasks, such as the Intersection over Union (IoU) reward for object detection. Experimental results on fine-grained image classification, few-shot object detection, reasoning grounding, as well as open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks show the competitive performance and advanced generalization ability of Visual-RFT compared with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT). For example, Visual-RFT improves accuracy by 24.3% over the baseline in one-shot fine-grained image classification with around 100 samples. In few-shot object detection, Visual-RFT also exceeds the baseline by 21.9 on COCO's two-shot setting and 15.4 on LVIS. Our Visual-RFT represents a paradigm shift in fine-tuning LVLMs, offering a data-efficient, reward-driven approach that enhances reasoning and adaptability for domain-specific tasks.

Phi-4-Mini is a 3.8-billion-parameter language model trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly outperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the performance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex reasoning. This achievement is driven by a carefully curated synthetic data recipe emphasizing high-quality math and coding datasets. Compared to its predecessor, Phi-3.5-Mini, Phi-4-Mini features an expanded vocabulary size of 200K tokens to better support multilingual applications, as well as group query attention for more efficient long-sequence generation. Phi-4-Multimodal is a multimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input modalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages LoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes combining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks first in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the speech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal supports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and (speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language models on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train Phi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities. Despite its compact 3.8-billion-parameter size, this experimental version achieves reasoning performance on par with or surpassing significantly larger models, including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.

Test-time inference has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling language models to ``think'' longer and more carefully about complex challenges, much like skilled human experts. While reinforcement learning (RL) can drive self-improvement in language models on verifiable tasks, some models exhibit substantial gains while others quickly plateau. For instance, we find that Qwen-2.5-3B far exceeds Llama-3.2-3B under identical RL training for the game of Countdown. This discrepancy raises a critical question: what intrinsic properties enable effective self-improvement? We introduce a framework to investigate this question by analyzing four key cognitive behaviors -- verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining -- that both expert human problem solvers and successful language models employ. Our study reveals that Qwen naturally exhibits these reasoning behaviors, whereas Llama initially lacks them. In systematic experimentation with controlled behavioral datasets, we find that priming Llama with examples containing these reasoning behaviors enables substantial improvements during RL, matching or exceeding Qwen's performance. Importantly, the presence of reasoning behaviors, rather than correctness of answers, proves to be the critical factor -- models primed with incorrect solutions containing proper reasoning patterns achieve comparable performance to those trained on correct solutions. Finally, leveraging continued pretraining with OpenWebMath data, filtered to amplify reasoning behaviors, enables the Llama model to match Qwen's self-improvement trajectory. Our findings establish a fundamental relationship between initial reasoning behaviors and the capacity for improvement, explaining why some language models effectively utilize additional computation while others plateau.

Selecting high-quality training data from a larger pool is a crucial step when instruction-tuning language models, as carefully curated datasets often produce models that outperform those trained on much larger, noisier datasets. Automated data selection approaches for instruction-tuning are typically tested by selecting small datasets (roughly 10k samples) from small pools (100-200k samples). However, popular deployed instruction-tuned models often train on hundreds of thousands to millions of samples, subsampled from even larger data pools. We present a systematic study of how well data selection methods scale to these settings, selecting up to 2.5M samples from pools of up to 5.8M samples and evaluating across 7 diverse tasks. We show that many recently proposed methods fall short of random selection in this setting (while using more compute), and even decline in performance when given access to larger pools of data to select over. However, we find that a variant of representation-based data selection (RDS+), which uses weighted mean pooling of pretrained LM hidden states, consistently outperforms more complex methods across all settings tested -- all whilst being more compute-efficient. Our findings highlight that the scaling properties of proposed automated selection methods should be more closely examined. We release our code, data, and models at https://github.com/hamishivi/automated-instruction-selection.

We show that many recently proposed methods fall short of random selection in this setting (while using more compute), and even decline in performance when given access to larger pools of data to select over. However, we find that a variant of representation-based data selection (RDS+), which uses weighted mean pooling of pretrained LM hidden states, consistently outperforms more complex methods across all settings tested -- all whilst being more compute-efficient. Our findings highlight that the scaling properties of proposed automated selection methods should be more closely examined. We release our code, data, and models at https://github.com/hamishivi/automated-instruction-selection."
