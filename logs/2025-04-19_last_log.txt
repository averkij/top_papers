[19.04.2025 12:41] Abstract 0. Pre-training datasets are typically collected from web content and lack inherent domain divisions. For instance, widely used datasets like Common Crawl do not include explicit domain labels, while manually curating labeled datasets such as The Pile is labor-intensive. Consequently, identifying an op...

[19.04.2025 12:41] Abstract 5. While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance small language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models (LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency, and potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures.

[19.04.2025 12:41] Abstract 10. The success of text-to-image (T2I) generation models has spurred a proliferation of numerous model checkpoints fine-tuned from the same base model on various specialized datasets. This overwhelming specialized model production introduces new challenges for high parameter redundancy and huge storage ...

[19.04.2025 12:41] Abstract 11. Vision-language models are integral to computer vision research, yet many high-performing models remain closed-source, obscuring their data, design and training recipe. The research community has responded by using distillation from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark...

[19.04.2025 12:41] Abstract 16. Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key ingredient for enabling large language models (LLMs) to solve difficult problems, but comes with high latency and inference cost.

[19.04.2025 12:41] Mistral request. Model: mistral-large-latest. Prompt: Write simple and brief explanation (4-5 sentences) of an article in Chinese. Use short sentences. Text:

Pre-training datasets are typically collected from web content and lack inherent domain divisions. For instance, widely used datasets like Common Crawl do not include explicit domain labels, while manually curating labeled datasets such as The Pile is labor-intensive. Consequently, identifying an optimal pre-training data mixture remains a challenging problem, despite its significant benefits for pre-training performance. To address these challenges, we propose CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping (CLIMB), an automated framework that discovers, evaluates, and refines data mixtures in a pre-training setting. Specifically, CLIMB embeds and clusters large-scale datasets in a semantic space and then iteratively searches for optimal mixtures using a smaller proxy model and a predictor. When continuously trained on 400B tokens with this mixture, our 1B model exceeds the state-of-the-art Llama-3.2-1B by 2.0%. Moreover, we observe that optimizing for a specific domain (e.g., Social Sciences) yields a 5% improvement over random sampling. Finally, we introduce ClimbLab, a filtered 1.2-trillion-token corpus with 20 clusters as a research playground, and ClimbMix, a compact yet powerful 400-billion-token dataset designed for efficient pre-training that delivers superior performance under an equal token budget. We analyze the final data mixture, elucidating the characteristics of an optimal data mixture. Our data is available at: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/climb/

[19.04.2025 12:42] Response: This article discusses the fact that pre-training datasets typically come from web content and lack clear domain categorization. For example, widely used datasets like Common Crawl do not have explicit domain labels, while manually annotated datasets like The Pile require significant labor. To address these challenges, the authors propose CLIMB, an automated framework capable of discovering, evaluating, and optimizing pre-training data mixtures. CLIMB embeds and clusters large-scale datasets, iteratively searching for the optimal mixture. Experiments show that models trained using this mixture method perform better than existing models. The authors also introduce the ClimbLab and ClimbMix datasets and analyze the characteristics of the optimal data mixtures.
