[29.10.2024 14:12] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'GrounDiT: Grounding Diffusion Transformers via Noisy Patch Transplantation' Text: 'We introduce a novel training-free spatial grounding technique for text-to-image generation using Diffusion Transformers (DiT). Spatial grounding with bounding boxes has gained attention for its simplicity and versatility, allowing for enhanced user control in image generation. However, prior training-free approaches often rely on updating the noisy image during the reverse diffusion process via backpropagation from custom loss functions, which frequently struggle to provide precise control over individual bounding boxes. In this work, we leverage the flexibility of the Transformer architecture, demonstrating that DiT can generate noisy patches corresponding to each bounding box, fully encoding the target object and allowing for fine-grained control over each region. Our approach builds on an intriguing property of DiT, which we refer to as semantic sharing. Due to semantic sharing, when a smaller patch is jointly denoised alongside a generatable-size image, the two become "semantic clones". Each patch is denoised in its own branch of the generation process and then transplanted into the corresponding region of the original noisy image at each timestep, resulting in robust spatial grounding for each bounding box. In our experiments on the HRS and DrawBench benchmarks, we achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to previous training-free spatial grounding approaches.'
[29.10.2024 14:12] Response: **Image Prompt:** A linear art piece on a white background depicting a surreal landscape where abstract shapes of bounding boxes float in a dreamy, cloud-like atmosphere. Each bounding box contains fragmented images of objects that seem to merge and blend into one another, illustrating the concept of "semantic sharing." There are patches of color and texture that appear to be "transplanted" onto the canvas, creating a sense of depth and diffusion. The overall composition should evoke a feeling of controlled chaos, with a balance between structure (the bounding boxes) and fluidity (the dreamy patches). 

**Label for Object:** 'GrounDiT: Grounding Diffusion Transformers via Noisy Patch Transplantation'
