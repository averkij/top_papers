As language models grow ever larger, so do their vocabularies. This has shifted the memory footprint of LLMs during training disproportionately to one single layer: the cross-entropy in the loss computation. Cross-entropy builds up a logit matrix with entries for each pair of input tokens and vocabulary items and, for small models, consumes an order of magnitude more memory than the rest of the LLM combined. We propose Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE), a method that computes the cross-entropy loss without materializing the logits for all tokens into global memory. Rather, CCE only computes the logit for the correct token and evaluates the log-sum-exp over all logits on the fly. We implement a custom kernel that performs the matrix multiplications and the log-sum-exp reduction over the vocabulary in flash memory, making global memory consumption for the cross-entropy computation negligible. This has a dramatic effect. Taking the Gemma 2 (2B) model as an example, CCE reduces the memory footprint of the loss computation from 24 GB to 1 MB, and the total training-time memory consumption of the classifier head from 28 GB to 1 GB. To improve the throughput of CCE, we leverage the inherent sparsity of softmax and propose to skip elements of the gradient computation that have a negligible (i.e., below numerical precision) contribution to the gradient. Experiments demonstrate that the dramatic reduction in memory consumption is accomplished without sacrificing training speed or convergence.

This work explores expanding the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) pretrained on text to generate 3D meshes within a unified model. This offers key advantages of (1) leveraging spatial knowledge already embedded in LLMs, derived from textual sources like 3D tutorials, and (2) enabling conversational 3D generation and mesh understanding. A primary challenge is effectively tokenizing 3D mesh data into discrete tokens that LLMs can process seamlessly. To address this, we introduce LLaMA-Mesh, a novel approach that represents the vertex coordinates and face definitions of 3D meshes as plain text, allowing direct integration with LLMs without expanding the vocabulary. We construct a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset enabling pretrained LLMs to (1) generate 3D meshes from text prompts, (2) produce interleaved text and 3D mesh outputs as required, and (3) understand and interpret 3D meshes. Our work is the first to demonstrate that LLMs can be fine-tuned to acquire complex spatial knowledge for 3D mesh generation in a text-based format, effectively unifying the 3D and text modalities. LLaMA-Mesh achieves mesh generation quality on par with models trained from scratch while maintaining strong text generation performance.

"This work explores expanding the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) pretrained on text to generate 3D meshes within a unified model. This offers key advantages of (1) leveraging spatial knowledge already embedded in LLMs, derived from textual sources like 3D tutorials, and (2) enabling conversational 3D generation and mesh understanding. A primary challenge is effectively tokenizing 3D mesh data into discrete tokens that LLMs can process seamlessly. To address this, we introduce LLaMA-Mesh, a novel approach that represents the vertex coordinates and face definitions of 3D meshes as plain text, allowing direct integration with LLMs without expanding the vocabulary. We construct a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset enabling pretrained LLMs to (1) generate 3D meshes from text prompts, (2) produce interleaved text and 3D mesh outputs as required, and (3) understand and interpret 3D meshes. Our work is the first to demonstrate that LLMs can be fine-tuned to acquire complex spatial knowledge for 3D mesh generation in a text-based format, effectively unifying the 3D and text modalities. LLaMA-Mesh achieves mesh generation quality on par with models trained from scratch while maintaining strong text generation performance."
