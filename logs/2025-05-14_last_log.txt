[ 1 5 7 1 8 0 . 5 0 5 2 : r AbstractText-to-audio systems, while increasingly performant, are slow at inference time, thus making their latency unpractical for many creative applications. We present Adversarial Relativistic-Contrastive (ARC) posttraining, the first adversarial acceleration algorithm for diffusion/flow models not based on distillation. While past adversarial post-training methods have struggled to compare against their expensive distillation counterparts, ARC post-training is simple procedure that (1) extends recent relativistic adversarial formulation to diffusion/flow post-training and (2) combines it with novel contrastive discriminator objective to encourage better prompt adherence. We pair ARC post-training with number optimizations to Stable Audio Open and build model capable of generating 12s of 44.1kHz stereo audio in 75ms on an H100, and 7s on mobile edge-device, the fastest text-to-audio model to our knowledge. 1. INTRODUCTION Despite the recent progress building generative text-to-audio models, such systems require seconds to minutes per generation [1][4], which limits their usability for most creative use cases. Our goal is to accelerate gaussian flow-based models, i.e., diffusion models [5] or the more recent rectified flows [6]. Since gaussian flow models can be costly at inference time due to their iterative (step-based) sampling [7], considerable effort has gone into accelerating them [8][11]. Most of these works rely on (step) distillation, where the teacher model provides direct supervision to train distilled few-step generator. As such, the few-step generator learns to map multiple i"

The increasing adoption of agentic workflows across diverse domains brings a critical need to scalably and systematically evaluate the complex traces these systems generate. Current evaluation methods depend on manual, domain-specific human analysis of lengthy workflow traces - an approach that does not scale with the growing complexity and volume of agentic outputs. Error analysis in these settings is further complicated by the interplay of external tool outputs and language model reasoning, making it more challenging than traditional software debugging. In this work, we (1) articulate the need for robust and dynamic evaluation methods for agentic workflow traces, (2) introduce a formal taxonomy of error types encountered in agentic systems, and (3) present a set of 148 large human-annotated traces (TRAIL) constructed using this taxonomy and grounded in established agentic benchmarks. To ensure ecological validity, we curate traces from both single and multi-agent systems, focusing on real-world applications such as software engineering and open-world information retrieval. Our evaluations reveal that modern long context LLMs perform poorly at trace debugging, with the best Gemini-2.5-pro model scoring a mere 11% on TRAIL. Our dataset and code are made publicly available to support and accelerate future research in scalable evaluation for agentic workflows.

Text-to-audio systems, while increasingly performant, are slow at inference time, thus making their latency unpractical for many creative applications. We present Adversarial Relativistic-Contrastive (ARC) post-training, the first adversarial acceleration algorithm for diffusion/flow models not based on distillation. While past adversarial post-training methods have struggled to compare against their expensive distillation counterparts, ARC post-training is a simple procedure that (1) extends a recent relativistic adversarial formulation to diffusion/flow post-training and (2) combines it with a novel contrastive discriminator objective to encourage better prompt adherence. We pair ARC post-training with a number optimizations to Stable Audio Open and build a model capable of generating approx12s of 44.1kHz stereo audio in approx75ms on an H100, and approx7s on a mobile edge-device, the fastest text-to-audio model to our knowledge.
