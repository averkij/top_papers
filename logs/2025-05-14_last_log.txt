Introduction Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine visual perception with the general capabilities, such as reasoning, of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the mechanisms by which these two abilities can be combined and contribute remain poorly understood. In this work, we explore to compose perception and reasoning through model merging that connects parameters of different models. Unlike previous works that often focus on merging models of the same kind, we propose merging models across modalities, enabling the incorporation of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that model merging offers successful pathway to transfer reasoning abilities from LLMs to VLMs in training-free manner. Moreover, we utilize the merged models to understand the internal mechanism of perception and reasoning and how merging affects it. We find that perception capabilities are predominantly encoded in the early layers of the model, whereas reasoning is largely facilitated by the middle-to-late layers. After merging, we observe that all layers begin to contribute to reasoning, whereas the distribution of perception abilities across layers remains largely unchanged. These observations shed light on the potential of model merging as tool for multimodal integration and interpretation.

Proceedings of the 41 st International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada. PMLR 267, 2025. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 Multimodal reasoning is crucial for variety of important applications, such as interpreting charts and figures in scientific publications and government reports. Despite the great successes of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in tasks requiring perceptual and linguistic integration (Li et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024b), these models struggle with complex multimodal reasoning tasks (Lu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024b). This limitation partly due to the scarcity of multimodal reasoning data leaves them lagging far behind their language model counterpart which has made remarkable advancement in reasoning tasks (Yang et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). Perception and reasoning are two fundamental components in this context. While language models primarily represent the reasoning ability, VLMs demand both to succeed. Therefore, it is natural to ask: can we incorporate the reasoning ability of LMs into VLMs? Achieving such combination is challenging, as the interaction between perception and reasoning within VLMs remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate these questions through the lens of model merging (Ilharco et al., 2023), straightforward approach to explore whether perception and reasoning can be combined across modalities and how these two abilities are embedded within VLMs. Concretely, model merging generates new model by performing arithmetic operations on the parameters of existing models, without requiring additional training. This strategy works based on the assumption that models fine-tuned from shared initialization reside in connected subspace of the parameter space. While previous works on model merging focus on models of the same kind (Yadav et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024b), it remains unknown that whether models across different modalities are connectable to yield benefits. In this work, we specifically focus on the textual components of the VLMs and select LLMs with task-specific reasoning abilities that match the VLMs configuration, performing weighted average operation on their parameters as demonstrated in Figure 1. We conduct extensive experiments by merging commonly Bring Reason to Vision: Understanding Perception and Reasoning through Model Merging Figure 1: Illustration of our work investigating how model merging works when transferring reasoning ability from Math-specific LLM to the VLM, showcasing the effects and results of the merged model, as well as the interpretation of layer-wise abilities. The abilities are represented in corresponding colors: red indicates perception ability hidden in early layers, while blue denotes reasoning ability hidden in relatively later layers. used VLMs with LLMs trained on diverse math reasoning datasets (4). Our findings demonstrate that model merging consistently improves the reasoning capabilities of VLMs across all math benchmarks, with minimal impact on the perception-dominant tasks. For instance, merging with Dart (Tong et al., 2024) enhances LLaVAs performance on MathVistas (Lu et al., 2024) math-related subset, yielding 3.6-point absolute improvement. Even in Vision-Only mode of MathVerse (Zhang et al., 2025), where questions are presented in images, it also achieves 1.4-point absolute improvement. Experiments on multiple reasoning-related benchmarks and various VLMs consistently show improvement. These results underscore the potential of parameter merging as simple yet powerful mechanism for capability transfer across model architectures. Furthermore, we delve deeper into understanding how model merging works and how perception and reasoning interplay in this context. Specifically, we analyze parameter changes during the merging process to investigate whether different capabilities, such as high-level reasoning and lowlevel perception, are disentangled within distinct subspaces of the models parameter space (5). Through knockout analysis, we identify two key observations: (1) Image perceptual abilities and world knowledge are predominantly embedded in the early layers of the model, whereas mathematical reasoning skills are concentrated in the middle-tolate layers; and (2) Merging with reasoning models brings reasoning abilities to all the layers, while having minimal impact on the layer distribution of perception ability. These findings contribute to better understanding of how reasoning can be transferred between models"

Text:"Memorization-Compression Cycles Improve Generalization Fangyuan Yu TemusWe prove theoretically that generalization improves not only through data scaling but also by compressing internal representations. To operationalize this insight, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM) objective, which reframes language modeling as constrained optimization problem: minimizing representation entropy subject to optimal prediction performance. Empirically, we observe an emergent memorizationcompression cycle during LLM pretraining, evidenced by oscillating positive/negative gradient alignment between cross-entropy and Matrix-Based Entropy (MBE), measure for representation entropy. This pattern closely mirrors the predictivecompressive trade-off prescribed by IBLM and also parallels the biological alternation between active learning and sleep consolidation. Motivated by this observation, we propose Gated Phase Transition (GAPT), training algorithm that adaptively switches between memorization and compression phases. When applied to GPT-2 pretraining on FineWeb dataset, GAPT reduces MBE by 50% and improves cross-entropy by 4.8%. GAPT improves OOD generalization by 35% in pretraining task on arithmetic multiplication. In setting designed to simulate catastrophic forgetting, GAPT reduces interference by compressing and separating representations, achieving 97% improvement in separation paralleling the functional role of sleep consolidation in biological learning process.Generalization occurs when learning from one task improves performance on another. The pursuit of generalization in pre-training LLM [11] has historically focused on scaling up data and parameter size [4], in post-training, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) [7] has gained attention. However, high quality data has been exhausted after years of tireless scraping, and RLVR is shown to only trims knowledge from baseline model [10] instead of incentivize new reasoning pattern. We establish theoretical upper bound on generalization error for deep learning models, indicating representation entropy as another dimension for improving generalization besides scaling data. Theorem 1. Upper Bound on Generalization Error. Let and be random variables with an unknown joint distribution (X, ), and suppose is discrete with finite cardinality. Let be neural network with intermediate representations forming Markov chain: 5 2 0 2 3 1 ] . [ 1 7 2 7 8 0 . 5 0 5 2 : r R1 RL ˆY Where Rl is internal representations, ˆY is the prediction of the network. Then, for any dataset DN = {(xi, yi)}N i=1 sampled i.i.d. from (X, ), the generalization error satisfies for α [1, +): LP (X,Y )(f, ℓ) (cid:124) (cid:125) (cid:123)(cid:122) Generalization Error ˆLP (X,Y )(f, ℓ, DN ) (cid:125) (cid:123)(cid:122) Empirical Error (cid:124) + (cid:124) Preprint. Under review. (cid:18) 2αH(Rl) / log min 1lL (cid:123)(cid:122) Upper Bound on Generalization Gap (cid:19) (cid:125) (1) Intuitively, generalization performance of neural network can be improved by either increasing training data size, or by reducing entropy of its internal representations. We refer minimization of H(Rl) as compression, and minimizing empirical loss as memorization. The Information Bottleneck (IB) framework [8] characterizes the optimal representation as one that discards as much information from the input as possible, while preserving all information relevant to the output. Motivated by this, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM) objective, along with theorem showing equivalence of IBLM with IB framework under language modeling. Definition 1. Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM). Given language model with internal representations R1:L and output token variable , the IBLM objective is: min s.t. (cid:88) H(Rl) l=1 ˆY = arg min ˆY H(Y ˆY ) (2) Theorem 2. The IBLM objective defined in Equation 2 is equivalent to the classical Information Bottleneck formulation under the language modeling setting. Note that H(Y ˆY ) is the cross-entropy (CE) loss in conventional language modeling task [11]. In short, LBLM requires maximal compressing internal representation under optimal cross-entropy. To explicitly calculate H(R), we adopt Matrix-based entropy (MBE), first proposed in [5], given matrix Rsd concatenating token representations, MBE is given by Sα(T ) = 1 1 α (cid:16) (cid:88) ( log λi(K) Tr(K) )α(cid:17) where = RRT is the Gram matrix. MBE essentially provide continuous measure of matrix rank, by calculating entropy on distribution of singular values. It has been shown to exhibit strong correlation with embedding quality [14], where its also observed that later checkpoints in pre-trained base models has lower entropy, suggesting pre-training with cross-entropy loss alone leads to decrease in MBE. Previous work [15] observed that in deterministic models (where I(R; X) = H(R)), training with single loss target leads to two-phase trend: short initial memorization phase with rapid empirical loss reduction, followed by monotonic decrease in H(R), interpreted as compression phase. This observation suggests clean separation between learning and compression in deep networks. However, our empirical analysis of GPT pretraining reveals richer structure. By tracking the cosine similarity between gradients of CE and MBE, we observe that their alignment oscillates between positive and negative throughout training. This suggests that instead of proceeding through distinct phases, learning unfolds as cyclic process, continuously alternating between expanding representations to capture data (memorization) and reorganizing them into more compact forms (compression). Importantly, this local oscillation occurs alongside global trend of decreasing MBE, indicating that compression accumulates over time even as the network periodically re-enters memorization-like states. We refer to this phenomenon as the memorizationcompression cycle. In biological neural systems, learning is inherently cyclic, alternating between awake learning and sleep consolidation. In seminal study [18], sleep was shown to resolve interference between conflicting memories by encouraging competition between them. When two conflicting tasks were presented sequentially, awake learning alone led to catastrophic forgetting, as new synaptic updates overwrote previously learned associations. Sleep consolidation overcame this by reorganizing synaptic weightsallocating distinct subsets"

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine visual perception with the general capabilities, such as reasoning, of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the mechanisms by which these two abilities can be combined and contribute remain poorly understood. In this work, we explore to compose perception and reasoning through model merging that connects parameters of different models. Unlike previous works that often focus on merging models of the same kind, we propose merging models across modalities, enabling the incorporation of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that model merging offers a successful pathway to transfer reasoning abilities from LLMs to VLMs in a training-free manner. Moreover, we utilize the merged models to understand the internal mechanism of perception and reasoning and how merging affects it. We find that perception capabilities are predominantly encoded in the early layers of the model, whereas reasoning is largely facilitated by the middle-to-late layers. After merging, we observe that all layers begin to contribute to reasoning, whereas the distribution of perception abilities across layers remains largely unchanged. These observations shed light on the potential of model merging as a tool for multimodal integration and interpretation.

We prove theoretically that generalization improves not only through data scaling but also by compressing internal representations. To operationalize this insight, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM) objective, which reframes language modeling as a constrained optimization problem: minimizing representation entropy subject to optimal prediction performance. Empirically, we observe an emergent memorization-compression cycle during LLM pretraining, evidenced by oscillation positive/negative gradient alignment between cross-entropy and Matrix-Based Entropy (MBE), a measure of representation entropy. This pattern closely mirrors the predictive-compressive trade-off prescribed by IBLM and also parallels the biological alternation between awake learning and sleep consolidation. Motivated by this observation, we propose Gated Phase Transition (GAPT), a training algorithm that adaptively switches between memorization and compression phases. When applied to GPT-2 pretraining on FineWeb dataset, GAPT reduces MBE by 50% and improves cross-entropy by 4.8%. GAPT improves OOD generalizatino by 35% in a pretraining task on arithmetic multiplication. In a setting designed to simulate catastrophic forgetting, GAPT reduces interference by compressing and separating representations, achieving a 97% improvement in separation - paralleling the functional role of sleep consolidation.
