Most existing studies focus on English, and research on MRHP in Vietnamese remains limited due to the scarcity of quality annotated datasets. This gap motivates our effort to propose benchmark dataset for MRHP task in Vietnamese, formulated as ranking task following the study of Liu et al. [4], where reviews are ranked based on their helpfulness score, as detailed in Table 1. However, data annotation for high-quality dataset is often time-consuming and costly, requiring meticulous verification. To address this challenge, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in annotation, reducing manual effort while maintaining data quality. Despite their advantages in optimizing time and cost, LLMs still have limitations, requiring human verification to ensure accuracy and consistency. Therefore, we use human-AI collaborative annotation framework that integrates LLMs with human verification. Additionally, we demonstrate the advantages and limitations of LLMs and human annotators in the ViMRHP dataset construction process through our evaluation metrics and experimental results. In summary, our main contributions are three-fold: 1. ViMRHP Dataset. We introduce the ViMRHP dataset, Vietnamese Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction dataset. To the best of our knowledge, there are no large-scale datasets for the MRHP task in Vietnamese. ViMHRP via Human-AI Collaborative Annotation 3 2. Human-AI Collaborative Annotation. Annotation process of our ViMRHP dataset implements Human-AI Collaborative Annotation framework via two-step procedure: (1) AI annotation and (2) Human verification and refinement, ensuring time-efficiency, cost, and data quality. 3. Human-Verified versus AI-Annotated Data Quality. We evaluate ViMRHP with baseline models to compare human-verified and AI-annotated data, highlighting differences in quality, consistency, and biases.Previous work, Review Helpfulness Prediction (RHP) has explored various tasks and approaches [3]. In the context of text reviews, the impact of structural, lexical, syntactic, semantic, and meta-data features on the helpfulness of usergenerated reviews has been investigated [8], as well as semantic features [1] for predicting review helpfulness using Amazon votes as ground truth and validating findings with the human-annotated label. Argument mining has also been studied separately, with the AM2 [2] dataset focusing on its role in determining the helpfulness of text review. Reviewer expertise and temporal dynamics [9] have also been incorporated to enhance helpfulness prediction with dataset creation from user-generated reviews on TripAdvisor."

We present gg-bench, a collection of game environments designed to evaluate general reasoning capabilities in language models. Unlike most static benchmarks, gg-bench is a data generating process where new evaluation instances can be generated at will. In particular, gg-bench is synthetically generated by (1) using a large language model (LLM) to generate natural language descriptions of novel games, (2) using the LLM to implement each game in code as a Gym environment, and (3) training reinforcement learning (RL) agents via self-play on the generated games. We evaluate language models by their winrate against these RL agents by prompting models with the game description, current board state, and a list of valid moves, after which models output the moves they wish to take. gg-bench is challenging: state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieve winrates of 7-9% on gg-bench using in-context learning, while reasoning models such as o1, o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 achieve average winrates of 31-36%. We release the generated games, data generation process, and evaluation code in order to support future modeling work and expansion of our benchmark.

Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction (MRHP) is an essential task in recommender systems, particularly in E-commerce platforms. Determining the helpfulness of user-generated reviews enhances user experience and improves consumer decision-making. However, existing datasets focus predominantly on English and Indonesian, resulting in a lack of linguistic diversity, especially for low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. In this paper, we introduce ViMRHP (Vietnamese Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction), a large-scale benchmark dataset for MRHP task in Vietnamese. This dataset covers four domains, including 2K products with 46K reviews. Meanwhile, a large-scale dataset requires considerable time and cost. To optimize the annotation process, we leverage AI to assist annotators in constructing the ViMRHP dataset. With AI assistance, annotation time is reduced (90 to 120 seconds per task down to 20 to 40 seconds per task) while maintaining data quality and lowering overall costs by approximately 65%. However, AI-generated annotations still have limitations in complex annotation tasks, which we further examine through a detailed performance analysis. In our experiment on ViMRHP, we evaluate baseline models on human-verified and AI-generated annotations to assess their quality differences.

This dataset covers four domains, including 2K products with 46K reviews. Meanwhile, a large-scale dataset requires considerable time and cost. To optimize the annotation process, we leverage AI to assist annotators in constructing the ViMRHP dataset. With AI assistance, annotation time is reduced (90 to 120 seconds per task down to 20 to 40 seconds per task) while maintaining data quality and lowering overall costs by approximately 65%. However, AI-generated annotations still have limitations in complex annotation tasks, which we further examine through a detailed performance analysis. In our experiment on ViMRHP, we evaluate baseline models on human-verified and AI-generated annotations to assess their quality differences. The ViMRHP dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/trng28/ViMRHP"

"Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction (MRHP) is an essential task in recommender systems, particularly in E-commerce platforms. Determining the helpfulness of user-generated reviews enhances user experience and improves consumer decision-making. However, existing datasets focus predominantly on English and Indonesian, resulting in a lack of linguistic diversity, especially for low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. In this paper, we introduce ViMRHP (Vietnamese Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction), a large-scale benchmark dataset for MRHP task in Vietnamese. This dataset covers four domains, including 2K products with 46K reviews. Meanwhile, a large-scale dataset requires considerable time and cost. To optimize the annotation process, we leverage AI to assist annotators in constructing the ViMRHP dataset. With AI assistance, annotation time is reduced (90 to 120 seconds per task down to 20 to 40 seconds per task) while maintaining data quality and lowering overall costs by approximately 65%. However, AI-generated annotations still have limitations in complex annotation tasks, which we further examine through a detailed performance analysis. In our experiment on ViMRHP, we evaluate baseline models on human-verified and AI-generated annotations to assess their quality differences. The ViMRHP dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/trng28/ViMRHP"
