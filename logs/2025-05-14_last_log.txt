This study addresses the critical gap in Arabic natural language processing by developing an effective Arabic Reverse Dictionary (RD) system that enables users to find words based on their descriptions or meanings. We present a novel transformer-based approach with a semi-encoder neural network architecture featuring geometrically decreasing layers that achieves state-of-the-art results for Arabic RD tasks. Our methodology incorporates a comprehensive dataset construction process and establishes formal quality standards for Arabic lexicographic definitions. Experiments with various pre-trained models demonstrate that Arabic-specific models significantly outperform general multilingual embeddings, with ARBERTv2 achieving the best ranking score (0.0644). Additionally, we provide a formal abstraction of the reverse dictionary task that enhances theoretical understanding and develop a modular, extensible Python library (RDTL) with configurable training pipelines. Our analysis of dataset quality reveals important insights for improving Arabic definition construction, leading to eight specific standards for building high-quality reverse dictionary resources. This work contributes significantly to Arabic computational linguistics and provides valuable tools for language learning, academic writing, and professional communication in Arabic.

"This study addresses the critical gap in Arabic natural language processing by developing an effective Arabic Reverse Dictionary (RD) system that enables users to find words based on their descriptions or meanings. We present a novel transformer-based approach with a semi-encoder neural network architecture featuring geometrically decreasing layers that achieves state-of-the-art results for Arabic RD tasks. Our methodology incorporates a comprehensive dataset construction process and establishes formal quality standards for Arabic lexicographic definitions. Experiments with various pre-trained models demonstrate that Arabic-specific models significantly outperform general multilingual embeddings, with ARBERTv2 achieving the best ranking score (0.0644). Additionally, we provide a formal abstraction of the reverse dictionary task that enhances theoretical understanding and develop a modular, extensible Python library (RDTL) with configurable training pipelines. Our analysis of dataset quality reveals important insights for improving Arabic definition construction, leading to eight specific standards for building high-quality reverse dictionary resources. This work contributes significantly to Arabic computational linguistics and provides valuable tools for language learning, academic writing, and professional communication in Arabic."
