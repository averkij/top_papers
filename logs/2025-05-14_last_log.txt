[ 1 5 6 1 6 8 0 . 5 0 5 2 : r Abstract Assessing human skill levels in complex activities is challenging problem with applications in sports, rehabilitation, and training. In this work, we present SkillFormer, parameter-efficient architecture for unified multi-view proficiency estimation from egocentric and exocentric videos. Building on the TimeSformer backbone, SkillFormer introduces CrossViewFusion module that fuses view-specific features using multi-head cross-attention, learnable gating, and adaptive self-calibration. We leverage Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune only small subset of parameters, significantly reducing training costs. In fact, when evaluated on the EgoExo4D dataset, SkillFormer achieves state-ofthe-art accuracy in multi-view settings while demonstrating remarkable computational efficiency, using 4.5x fewer parameters and requiring 3.75x fewer training epochs than prior baselines. It excels in multiple structured tasks, confirming the value of multi-view integration for fine-grained skill assessment. Automatically estimating human expertise from video is key challenge in computer vision, especially in domains like sports, rehabilitation, and skill training. Yet, unlike action recognition, this task requires capturing subtle differences in motion quality and precision, which are often visible only through combination of viewpoints. To address this, we propose SkillFormer, lightweight and efficient architecture for multi-view skill assessment. SkillFormer processes synchronized egocentric and exocentric video streams using TimeSformer backbone, enhanced by novel CrossViewFusion module that leverages cross-attention and learnable gating. To enable efficient fine-tuning, it incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation "

Instruction following evaluates large language models (LLMs) on their ability to generate outputs that adhere to user-defined constraints. However, existing benchmarks often rely on templated constraint prompts, which lack the diversity of real-world usage and limit fine-grained performance assessment. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional constraint framework encompassing three constraint patterns, four constraint categories, and four difficulty levels. Building on this framework, we develop an automated instruction generation pipeline that performs constraint expansion, conflict detection, and instruction rewriting, yielding 1,200 code-verifiable instruction-following test samples. We evaluate 19 LLMs across seven model families and uncover substantial variation in performance across constraint forms. For instance, average performance drops from 77.67% at Level I to 32.96% at Level IV. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to generate data for reinforcement learning, achieving substantial gains in instruction following without degrading general performance. In-depth analysis indicates that these gains stem primarily from modifications in the model's attention modules parameters, which enhance constraint recognition and adherence. Code and data are available in https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/MulDimIF.
