Text:"5 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 2 0 7 5 8 0 . 6 0 5 2 : r Auto-Regressive vs Flow-Matching: Comparative Study of Modeling Paradigms for Text-to-Music Generationor.tal1@mail.huji.ac.il felixkreuk@meta.com yossi.adi@mail.huji.ac.ilRecent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA) systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets, modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important, in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional Flow-Matching. We conduct controlled comparison by training all models from scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability, adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation. Audio sampled examples are available at: https://huggingface.co/spaces/ortal1602/ARvsFMUnlike text and vision domains, the audio domain, and music generation in particular, has not yet converged on dominant modeling approach. While both Auto-Regressive (AR) and non-AR methods have shown strong results, the trade-offs between them remain under explored (Zhu et al., 2023; Pathariya et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025). In natural language processing, the dominant modeling paradigm is AR generation over discrete token sequences (Touvron et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024). In computer vision, leading models are typically non-AR, relying on diffusion or flow-matching processes over continuous latent spaces (Podell et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). However, it is not clear what approach should we follow for music and audio generation. Copet et al. (2023); Agostinelli et al. (2023) demonstrate impressive performance following the AR approach using discrete audio representation. In contrast, Chen et al. (2024); Lan et al. (2024) follows 1 Table 1: Concise summary of our conclusions: AR vs FM.Text-to-music delity (Sec. 5.1) fiAR AR shows slightly better objective scores; robust to changes in frame rate. FM showed less robustness to frame-rate changes, especially in the VAE-based case. Temporal trol (Sec. 5.2) conadherence inpainting Music (Sec. 5.3) Inference speed and batch scaling (Sec. 5.4) Sensitivity to training configuration (Sec. 5.5) AR Better chord IoU and melody similarity; both paradigms lose fidelity using temporally aligned controls. FM (supervised) FM has the highest human evaluation scores; AR has lowest FAD but often generate bad transitions; FM (ZS) is unstable. Setting dependent AR wins at high batch sizes by utilizing key-value cache; FM could be faster than AR by sacrificing fidelity. FM FM reaches near-topline (Sec. 5.1) quality with small batches; AR needs larger batches to recover its topline scores. AR kept improving between 500K and 1M training steps, whereas FM gains tapered off. the diffusion and flow matching approaches and also show impressive performance. Lastly, Li et al. (2024); Bai et al. (2024) proposed hybrid methods utilizing AR and non-AR methods. While growing number of systems have demonstrated compelling capabilities in text-conditioned music generation, it is unclear what fundamentally accounts for performance differences across models. Variations in training data, latent representations, architecture design, and optimization procedures often confound evaluation. As result, there is little consensus on whether improvements arise from the modeling paradigm itself or from external factors, like the training data or architectural choices. These contrasts underscore the need for systematic comparison in audio modeling, where foundational choices are still in flux. To mitigate that, we present controlled empirical study comparing the two prominent and commonly used approaches for generative modeling in text-to-music generation: AR and Conditional Flow Matching (FM) (non-AR). All models are trained from scratch using the same training data, latent representations, and similar transformer model backbone architectures. We evaluate each modeling paradigm across multiple axes including perceptual quality, inference efficiency, robustness to training configuration, adherence to temporal control, and editing capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This design isolates the modeling approach as the primary experimental variable. Our results highlight consistent differences between the two paradigms. AR models exhibit slightly higher perceptual quality and stronger temporally-aligned control adherence, while flow-matching models show potential to offer faster inference and greater flexibility for editing tasks. Such findings and additional observations outlined in this work provide practical guidance for selecting modeling paradigms in future music generation systems and are broadly covered in the following sections. Table 1 draws summarized overview of our main conclusions."

"A systematic comparison of Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional Flow-Matching in text-to-music generation highlights distinct strengths and limitations of each modeling paradigm.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA) systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets, modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important, in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability, adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation.

An adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent performs similarly to human players in online Mafia games, demonstrating the potential for integrating LLMs into realistic group settings with complex social dynamics.  					AI-generated summary 				 LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns, although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must be navigated.
