We present BootComp, a novel framework based on text-to-image diffusion models for controllable human image generation with multiple reference garments. Here, the main bottleneck is data acquisition for training: collecting a large-scale dataset of high-quality reference garment images per human subject is quite challenging, i.e., ideally, one needs to manually gather every single garment photograph worn by each human. To address this, we propose a data generation pipeline to construct a large synthetic dataset, consisting of human and multiple-garment pairs, by introducing a model to extract any reference garment images from each human image. To ensure data quality, we also propose a filtering strategy to remove undesirable generated data based on measuring perceptual similarities between the garment presented in human image and extracted garment. Finally, by utilizing the constructed synthetic dataset, we train a diffusion model having two parallel denoising paths that use multiple garment images as conditions to generate human images while preserving their fine-grained details. We further show the wide-applicability of our framework by adapting it to different types of reference-based generation in the fashion domain, including virtual try-on, and controllable human image generation with other conditions, e.g., pose, face, etc.

  "desc": "В статье представлен BootComp - новый фреймворк для генерации изображений людей с контролируемой одеждой, основанный на диффузионных моделях преобразования текста в изображение. Авторы предлагают конвейер для создания синтетического набора данных, состоящего из пар 'человек-несколько предметов одежды', используя модель для извлечения эталонных изображений одежды из каждого изображения человека. Для обеспечения качества данных применяется стратегия фильтрации, основанная на измерении перцептивного сходства между одеждой на изображении человека и извлеченной одеждой. Обученная на этом наборе данных диффузионная модель имеет два параллельных пути шумоподавления, использующих несколько изображений одежды в качестве условий для генерации изображений людей.",
