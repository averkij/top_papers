To accelerate the inference of heavy Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this study rethinks the current landscape of training-free token reduction research. We regret to find that the critical components of existing methods are tightly intertwined, with their interconnections and effects remaining unclear for comparison, transfer, and expansion. Therefore, we propose a unified ''filter-correlate-compress'' paradigm that decomposes the token reduction into three distinct stages within a pipeline, maintaining consistent design objectives and elements while allowing for unique implementations. We additionally demystify the popular works and subsume them into our paradigm to showcase its universality. Finally, we offer a suite of methods grounded in the paradigm, striking a balance between speed and accuracy throughout different phases of the inference. Experimental results across 10 benchmarks indicate that our methods can achieve up to an 82.4% reduction in FLOPs with a minimal impact on performance, simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art training-free methods.

The proliferation of AI techniques for image generation, coupled with their increasing accessibility, has raised significant concerns about the potential misuse of these images to spread misinformation. Recent AI-generated image detection (AGID) methods include CNNDetection, NPR, DM Image Detection, Fake Image Detection, DIRE, LASTED, GAN Image Detection, AIDE, SSP, DRCT, RINE, OCC-CLIP, De-Fake, and Deep Fake Detection. However, we argue that the current state-of-the-art AGID techniques are inadequate for effectively detecting contemporary AI-generated images and advocate for a comprehensive reevaluation of these methods. We introduce the Visual Counter Turing Test (VCT^2), a benchmark comprising ~130K images generated by contemporary text-to-image models (Stable Diffusion 2.1, Stable Diffusion XL, Stable Diffusion 3, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney 6). VCT^2 includes two sets of prompts sourced from tweets by the New York Times Twitter account and captions from the MS COCO dataset. We also evaluate the performance of the aforementioned AGID techniques on the VCT^2 benchmark, highlighting their ineffectiveness in detecting AI-generated images. As image-generative AI models continue to evolve, the need for a quantifiable framework to evaluate these models becomes increasingly critical. To meet this need, we propose the Visual AI Index (V_AI), which assesses generated images from various visual perspectives, including texture complexity and object coherence, setting a new standard for evaluating image-generative AI models. To foster research in this domain, we make our https://huggingface.co/datasets/anonymous1233/COCO_AI and https://huggingface.co/datasets/anonymous1233/twitter_AI datasets publicly available.

Despite advances in Large Multi-modal Models, applying them to long and untrimmed video content remains challenging due to limitations in context length and substantial memory overhead. These constraints often lead to significant information loss and reduced relevance in the model responses. With the exponential growth of video data across web platforms, understanding long-form video is crucial for advancing generalized intelligence. In this paper, we introduce SALOVA: Segment-Augmented LOng Video Assistant, a novel video-LLM framework designed to enhance the comprehension of lengthy video content through targeted retrieval process. We address two main challenges to achieve it: (i) We present the SceneWalk dataset, a high-quality collection of 87.8K long videos, each densely captioned at the segment level to enable models to capture scene continuity and maintain rich descriptive context. (ii) We develop robust architectural designs integrating dynamic routing mechanism and spatio-temporal projector to efficiently retrieve and process relevant video segments based on user queries. Our framework mitigates the limitations of current video-LMMs by allowing for precise identification and retrieval of relevant video segments in response to queries, thereby improving the contextual relevance of the generated responses. Through extensive experiments, SALOVA demonstrates enhanced capability in processing complex long-form videos, showing significant capability to maintain contextual integrity across extended sequences.
