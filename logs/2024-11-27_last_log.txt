Recent advances in image editing, driven by image diffusion models, have shown remarkable progress. However, significant challenges remain, as these models often struggle to follow complex edit instructions accurately and frequently compromise fidelity by altering key elements of the original image. Simultaneously, video generation has made remarkable strides, with models that effectively function as consistent and continuous world simulators. In this paper, we propose merging these two fields by utilizing image-to-video models for image editing. We reformulate image editing as a temporal process, using pretrained video models to create smooth transitions from the original image to the desired edit. This approach traverses the image manifold continuously, ensuring consistent edits while preserving the original image's key aspects. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on text-based image editing, demonstrating significant improvements in both edit accuracy and image preservation.

The authors propose a novel approach that combines image editing with video generation by treating image editing as a temporal process. By leveraging pretrained video models, they create smooth transitions from the original image to the edited version, ensuring that key elements are preserved. Their method achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-based image editing, significantly enhancing both the accuracy of edits and the fidelity of the original image.', title='Seamless Image Editing through Video Model Integration'))
