Text:"Learning 3D Representations from Procedural 3D Programs University of Virginia https://point-mae-zero.cs.virginia.edu/ 4 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 7 6 4 7 1 . 1 1 4 2 : r Figure 1. Main idea and key findings. We learn 3D representations with Point-MAE [19] on two distinct datasets: (a) ShapeNet [3], which provides semantically meaningful 3D models, and (b) procedurally generated 3D shapes [34, 37, 38] that lack semantic structure. We refer to models trained on ShapeNet as Point-MAE-SN and those trained on procedurally generated shapes as Point-MAE-Zero. In (c), the x-axis represents various tasks and benchmarks: ModelNet40 [15] and three variants of ScanObjectNN [25] for shape classification, and ShapeNetPart [41] for part segmentation. Surprisingly, Point-MAE-Zero performs comparably to Point-MAE-SN on ModelNet40 [15] and even outperforms it on the three variants of ScanObjectNN [25] and on part segmentation. Both Point-MAE-Zero and Point-MAESN significantly outperform training from scratch. In (d), we show that pretrained Point-MAE-Zero can perform masked point cloud reconstruction similarly to Point-MAE-SN, without requiring fine-tuning. "

Building Graphical User Interface (GUI) assistants holds significant promise for enhancing human workflow productivity. While most agents are language-based, relying on closed-source API with text-rich meta-information (e.g., HTML or accessibility tree), they show limitations in perceiving UI visuals as humans do, highlighting the need for GUI visual agents. In this work, we develop a vision-language-action model in digital world, namely ShowUI, which features the following innovations: (i) UI-Guided Visual Token Selection to reduce computational costs by formulating screenshots as an UI connected graph, adaptively identifying their redundant relationship and serve as the criteria for token selection during self-attention blocks; (ii) Interleaved Vision-Language-Action Streaming that flexibly unifies diverse needs within GUI tasks, enabling effective management of visual-action history in navigation or pairing multi-turn query-action sequences per screenshot to enhance training efficiency; (iii) Small-scale High-quality GUI Instruction-following Datasets by careful data curation and employing a resampling strategy to address significant data type imbalances. With above components, ShowUI, a lightweight 2B model using 256K data, achieves a strong 75.1% accuracy in zero-shot screenshot grounding. Its UI-guided token selection further reduces 33% of redundant visual tokens during training and speeds up the performance by 1.4x. Navigation experiments across web Mind2Web, mobile AITW, and online MiniWob environments further underscore the effectiveness and potential of our model in advancing GUI visual agents.

The advent of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced multimodal tasks, enabling more sophisticated and accurate reasoning across various applications, including image and video captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. Despite their superior capabilities, VLMs struggle with fine-grained image regional composition information perception. Specifically, they have difficulty accurately aligning the segmentation masks with the corresponding semantics and precisely describing the compositional aspects of the referred regions.   However, compositionality - the ability to understand and generate novel combinations of known visual and textual components - is critical for facilitating coherent reasoning and understanding across modalities by VLMs. To address this issue, we propose FINECAPTION, a novel VLM that can recognize arbitrary masks as referential inputs and process high-resolution images for compositional image captioning at different granularity levels. To support this endeavor, we introduce COMPOSITIONCAP, a new dataset for multi-grained region compositional image captioning, which introduces the task of compositional attribute-aware regional image captioning.   Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model compared to other state-of-the-art VLMs. Additionally, we analyze the capabilities of current VLMs in recognizing various visual prompts for compositional region image captioning, highlighting areas for improvement in VLM design and training.

Self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for acquiring transferable 3D representations from unlabeled 3D point clouds. Unlike 2D images, which are widely accessible, acquiring 3D assets requires specialized expertise or professional 3D scanning equipment, making it difficult to scale and raising copyright concerns. To address these challenges, we propose learning 3D representations from procedural 3D programs that automatically generate 3D shapes using simple primitives and augmentations.   Remarkably, despite lacking semantic content, the 3D representations learned from this synthesized dataset perform on par with state-of-the-art representations learned from semantically recognizable 3D models (e.g., airplanes) across various downstream 3D tasks, including shape classification, part segmentation, and masked point cloud completion. Our analysis further suggests that current self-supervised learning methods primarily capture geometric structures rather than high-level semantics.

While high-quality texture maps are essential for realistic 3D asset rendering, few studies have explored learning directly in the texture space, especially on large-scale datasets. In this work, we depart from the conventional approach of relying on pre-trained 2D diffusion models for test-time optimization of 3D textures. Instead, we focus on the fundamental problem of learning in the UV texture space itself. For the first time, we train a large diffusion model capable of directly generating high-resolution texture maps in a feed-forward manner. To facilitate efficient learning in high-resolution UV spaces, we propose a scalable network architecture that interleaves convolutions on UV maps with attention layers on point clouds. Leveraging this architectural design, we train a 700 million parameter diffusion model that can generate UV texture maps guided by text prompts and single-view images. Once trained, our model naturally supports various extended applications, including text-guided texture inpainting, sparse-view texture completion, and text-driven texture synthesis.

The automatic generation of anchor-style product promotion videos presents promising opportunities in online commerce, advertising, and consumer engagement. However, this remains a challenging task despite significant advancements in pose-guided human video generation. In addressing this challenge, we identify the integration of human-object interactions (HOI) into pose-guided human video generation as a core issue. To this end, we introduce AnchorCrafter, a novel diffusion-based system designed to generate 2D videos featuring a target human and a customized object, achieving high visual fidelity and controllable interactions. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: the HOI-appearance perception, which enhances object appearance recognition from arbitrary multi-view perspectives and disentangles object and human appearance, and the HOI-motion injection, which enables complex human-object interactions by overcoming challenges in object trajectory conditioning and inter-occlusion management. Additionally, we introduce the HOI-region reweighting loss, a training objective that enhances the learning of object details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed system outperforms existing methods in preserving object appearance and shape awareness, while simultaneously maintaining consistency in human appearance and motion.

Система решает проблему интеграции взаимодействий человека с объектами в генерацию видео на основе поз. AnchorCrafter использует инновационные подходы HOI-appearance perception и HOI-motion injection для улучшения распознавания внешнего вида объекта и управления сложными взаимодействиями. Эксперименты показывают, что система превосходит существующие методы в сохранении внешнего вида объекта при поддержании согласованности внешнего вида и движений человека.",
