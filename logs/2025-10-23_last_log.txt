Rendering text as images reduces token usage for decoder LLMs without compromising performance on tasks like long-context retrieval and document summarization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants can now process visual inputs, including images of text. This raises an intriguing question: can we compress textual inputs by feeding them as images to reduce token usage while preserving performance? In this paper, we show that visual text representations are a practical and surprisingly effective form of input compression for decoder LLMs. We exploit the idea of rendering long text inputs as a single image and provide it directly to the model. This leads to dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of input compression. Through experiments on two distinct benchmarks RULER (long-context retrieval) and CNN/DailyMail (document summarization) we demonstrate that this text-as-image method yields substantial token savings (often nearly half) without degrading task performance.

Эксперименты на бенчмарках RULER (поиск в длинном контексте) и CNN/DailyMail (суммаризация документов) показали, что метод сокращает число токенов почти вдвое без потери качества. Это открывает новые возможности для оптимизации работы с длинными текстами в AI-системах."

"Rendering text as images reduces token usage for decoder LLMs without compromising performance on tasks like long-context retrieval and document summarization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants can now process visual inputs, including images of text. This raises an intriguing question: can we compress textual inputs by feeding them as images to reduce token usage while preserving performance? In this paper, we show that visual text representations are a practical and surprisingly effective form of input compression for decoder LLMs. We exploit the idea of rendering long text inputs as a single image and provide it directly to the model. This leads to dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of input compression. Through experiments on two distinct benchmarks RULER (long-context retrieval) and CNN/DailyMail (document summarization) we demonstrate that this text-as-image method yields substantial token savings (often nearly half) without degrading task performance."
