GigaBrain-0: World Model-Powered Vision-LanguageAction Model 1. Introduction Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models (Bjorck et al., 2025; Black et al., 2024; Bu et al., 2025; Cheang et al., 2025; Intelligence et al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2025; Zhai et al., 2025) have shown promising results in enabling generalist robots to understand high-level instructions, perceive their environments, and execute complex manipulation tasks. These models aim to bridge the gap between symbolic reasoning and embodied action by integrating visual inputs, natural language commands, and motor control into unified framework. However, training such models typically relies on large-scale datasets of real-world robot interactions, and such data collection is not only expensive and time-consuming but also limited in diversity and scalability. The inefficiency of physical data collection poses fundamental bottleneck to the development of robust, general-purpose robotic systems capable of operating across wide range of environments, objects, and task configurations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GigaBrain-0, novel VLA foundation model that leverages world model-generated data to reduce reliance on costly real-world robot data while improving generalization and data efficiency. By training on synthetic yet realistic trajectories generated by world models, as shown in Fig. 1, GigaBrain-0 accesses vast and diverse set of experiences, including variations in object materials, colors, lighting, and viewpoints, far beyond what is feasible to collect physically. This scalable data generation pipeline enables the model to learn robust representations that transfer effectively to real-world environments. Our approach further enhances policy robustness through two framework innovations: RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. By incorporating depth information, the model gains richer understanding of 3D geometry and spatial layout, which is crucial for precise manipulation. Meanwhile, the embodied CoT framework encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, such as manipulation trajectories and subgoal planning, mimicking the cognitive processes underlying human problem-solving. This structured reasoning enables effective handling of long-horizon tasks and fine-grained actions that require sustained attention and sequential decision-making. We evaluate GigaBrain-0 through extensive real-world robotic deployments, including dexterous manipulation tasks (e.g., laundry folding, paper towel preparation), long-horizon tasks (e.g., table bussing, juice preparation), mobile manipulation tasks (e.g., boxes moving, laundry baskets moving). Results show that GigaBrain-0 delivers consistently strong performance across this broad range of tasks and exhibits exceptional generalization under diverse conditions, including changes in appearances (e.g., texture, color), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Furthermore, we introduce GigaBrain-0-Small, an efficient variant optimized for deployment on hardware like the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. Our work highlights the potential of world model-generated data as scalable and effective alternative to traditional data collection paradigms, marking significant step toward versatile, general-purpose robotic systems. 2. Related Works 2.1. Vision-Language-Action Models Developing general-purpose robotic manipulation policies that can interpret high-level instructions and operate effectively in diverse physical environments remains fundamental challenge in robotics. Prior approaches (Karamcheti et al., 2023; Nair et al., 2022; Radford et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2022) have focused on leveraging heterogeneous datasets to learn rich, transferable representations that enhance policy robustness in complex and unseen scenarios. Inspired by advances in large language models, VLA frameworks (Bjorck et al., 2025; Black et al., 2024; Cheang et al., 2025; Doshi et al., 2024; Intelligence et al., 2025; Kim et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; ONeill et al., 2024; Pertsch et al., 2025; Qu et al., 2025; Team et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024) have emerged as promising paradigm, scaling model capacity and data volume to improve generalization across tasks and embodiments. These models typically build upon pretrained vision-language models (Alayrac et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2025; Beyer et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023), integrating 2 GigaBrain-0: World Model-Powered Vision-LanguageAction Model multimodal inputs to generate action"

Current large language models exhibit significant limitations in social reasoning, particularly in inferring interpersonal relationships across different languages, and thinking models or chain-of-thought prompting offer minimal improvement.  					AI-generated summary 				 As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean, sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends, sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S. Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around 75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to 58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities, highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.

"Current large language models exhibit significant limitations in social reasoning, particularly in inferring interpersonal relationships across different languages, and thinking models or chain-of-thought prompting offer minimal improvement.  					AI-generated summary 				 As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean, sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends, sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S. Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around 75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to 58-69%.

The Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection (ODiS) algorithm enhances large language model performance by ensuring both quality and diversity in training data through orthogonal decomposition of evaluation dimensions.  					AI-generated summary 				 High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection (ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores, enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension, thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data selection for LLMs.

"The Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection (ODiS) algorithm enhances large language model performance by ensuring both quality and diversity in training data through orthogonal decomposition of evaluation dimensions.  					AI-generated summary 				 High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection (ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores, enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension, thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data selection for LLMs."

Transformers struggle with generalizable algorithms, preferring heuristics; a disentangled Transformer can learn graph algorithms within its capacity but resorts to heuristics otherwise.  					AI-generated summary 				 Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an L-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly 3^L, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter leq 3^L) drive the learning of a correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the degree-based heuristic.

Theoretical and empirical investigation shows strong transferability between membership inference attacks and machine-generated text detection, highlighting the need for cross-task collaboration and introducing MINT for unified evaluation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability, i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments, including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

"Theoretical and empirical investigation shows strong transferability between membership inference attacks and machine-generated text detection, highlighting the need for cross-task collaboration and introducing MINT for unified evaluation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability, i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments, including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks."

GigaBrain-0, a VLA foundation model, uses world model-generated data to enhance cross-task generalization and policy robustness, improving real-world performance on complex manipulation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.
