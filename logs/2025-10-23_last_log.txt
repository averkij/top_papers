Text:"SAVANT: Semantic Analysis with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection Roberto Brusnicki, David Pop, Yuan Gao, Mattia Piccinini, Johannes Betz 5 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 4 3 0 8 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r Abstract Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), structured reasoning framework that in detecting anomalous achieves high accuracy and recall driving scenarios from input images through layered scene analysis and two-phase pipeline: structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables fine-tuned 7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8% accuracysurpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly detection and provides practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic monitoring for autonomous systems. I. INTRODUCTION The widespread and safe deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) depends on their ability to respond well to the long-tail of rare, low-probability occurrences that are impossible to exhaustively collect and exhibit in training datasets [22]. Modern autonomous driving systems (ADS) work successfully in the "

[ 1 4 3 0 8 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r Abstract Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), structured reasoning framework that in detecting anomalous achieves high accuracy and recall driving scenarios from input images through layered scene analysis and two-phase pipeline: structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables fine-tuned 7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8% accuracysurpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly detection and provides practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic monitoring for autonomous systems. I. INTRODUCTION The widespread and safe deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) depends on their ability to respond well to the long-tail of rare, low-probability occurrences that are impossible to exhaustively collect and exhibit in training datasets [22]. Modern autonomous driving systems (ADS) work successfully in the usual ordinary casesyet remain brittle in unexpected cases, undermining public trust. Real world failures, such as mistaking full moon for traffic light or billboard stop sign for real one, highlight the gravity of the problem [16]. Figure 2 displays common semantic mismatches, where objects are misaligned with their context. These instances reflect critical failures of contextualization that threaten the safe adoption of autonomous vehicles. Vision Language Models (VLMs) are pretrained on large image-text datasets, enabling contextual reasoning with broad world knowledge [1], [2]. With this rich semantics, VLMs can interpret complex scenes, reasoning about object relationships, spatial configuration, and context beyond current perception systems. Just as foundation models have emerged in large language models (LLMs), LLMs have already been explored for autonomous driving [3]. Recent R. Brusnicki, D. Pop, Y. Gao, M. Piccinini, and J. Betz are with the Professorship of Autonomous Vehicle Systems, TUM School of Engineering and Design, Technical University of Munich, 85748 Garching, Germany; Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (MIRMI) Fig. 1. Overview of the SAVANT framework. Driving images are processed in two phases: (1) Scene Description Extraction, where VLM generates textual descriptions of scene layers (street, infrastructure, movable objects, environmental); (2) Scene Evaluation, where the original image and aggregated descriptions are jointly analyzed for anomaly classification. The resulting classifications undergo human verification and correction through Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) curation to create high-quality training dataset, which is subsequently used to fine-tune an enhanced VLM capable of single-shot anomaly detection while maintaining compatibility with the original multi-phase framework. developments in VLMs have provided promising ability in visual perception and natural language reasoning, suggesting potential to detect subtle contextual inconsistencies in driving anomalies. However, big limitation arises in using VLMs for safety-critical anomaly detection: unstructured prompting is unreliable, often requiring costly proprietary models. Simple queries like Is this scene anomalous? lack robustness, interpretability, and consistency. Our findings show that promptbased strategies miss critical anomalies and yield false positives, while large proprietary models add prohibitive cost and latency for real-time use. A. Related Work 1) Foundation Models for Driving Intelligence: Recent works have used foundation models in the context of autonomous driving in two ways that are complementary: as an end-to-end driving agent and as an advanced sceneunderstanding system. The first trend removes modularity, mapping sensor data directly to vehicle controls. LMDrive, DriveGPT4, and more recent models like EMMA and ImagiDrive exemplify VLM use, including complex driving characteristics with closed loop methodology [8], [9], [10], This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible. Other works took data-centric approaches, using VLMs to mine corner cases or generative models to create challenging scenario [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. These aim to improve training robustness with more diverse data, while our method provides runtime safety net for anomalies persisting after training. Prior research suffers from poor interpretability, text-only reasoning, or reliance on simulation. In contrast, we use multimodal VLMs directly on real-world images, bridging modal and simulation gaps. Our layered method, to our knowledge the first for automated semantic anomaly classification on real driving data, provides direct visual evidence for more reliable and trustworthy autonomous systems. B. Critical Summary The emergence of foundation models is transforming autonomous driving research, moving from modular pipelines to end-to-end system [1], [2], [3], [4]. This transition advances reasoning and scene understanding, but raises the challenge of reliability in rare long-tail events. We address this challenge by using Vision-Language Model (VLM) to monitor semantic failuresscenes where object arrangements are contextually unsafe [6], [7], [5]. Current approaches suffer from several critical limitations: unstructured prompting lacks robustness, interpretability, and consistency; end-to-end models are blac"

MusicRFM uses Recursive Feature Machines to enable real-time, fine-grained control over pre-trained music models by steering their internal activations, improving musical note accuracy with minimal impact on prompt fidelity.  					AI-generated summary 				 Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

"MusicRFM uses Recursive Feature Machines to enable real-time, fine-grained control over pre-trained music models by steering their internal activations, improving musical note accuracy with minimal impact on prompt fidelity.  					AI-generated summary 				 Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain."

SAVANT, a structured reasoning framework using VLMs, achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios through layered scene analysis and multi-modal evaluation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline: structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned 7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8% accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic monitoring for autonomous systems.
