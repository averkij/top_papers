We present RIR-Mega, large collection of simulated RIRs described by compact, machine friendly metadata schema and distributed with simple tools for validation and reuse. The dataset ships with Hugging Face Datasets loader, scripts for metadata checks and checksums, and reference regression baseline that predicts RT60 like targets from waveforms. On train and validation split of 36,000 and 4,000 examples, small Random Forest on lightweight time and spectral features reaches mean absolute error near 0.013 and root mean square error near 0.022 s. We host subset with 1,000 linear array RIRs and 3,000 circular array RIRs on Hugging Face for streaming and quick tests, and preserve the complete 50,000 RIR archive on Zenodo. The dataset and code are public to support reproducible studies. Reverberation shapes both how people hear and how machine learning systems behave. Data for controlled studies are often hard to assemble at scale. Measured corpora can be small or lack detailed metadata, while simulated corpora sometimes have unclear provenance or inconvenient file layouts. Researchers spend time on path handling, schema drift, and brittle scripts rather than the questions they want to study. RIR-Mega was designed to lower these barriers. The dataset uses single compact CSV or Parquet file to describe each audio file. Paths are consistent. Acoustic metrics appear as JSON or dict like string and are also available as flat columns for fast filters. We provide loader that integrates with datasets.Audio, validation script for the metadata, and an optional checksum tool. The release includes simple baseline for RT60 regression so "

A unified reinforcement and imitation learning algorithm creates efficient, lightweight vision-language models that match or exceed leading VLMs in performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

В основе подхода лежит LLM-дискриминатор, который различает выходы студента и учителя, а также использует руководство от нескольких крупных VLM для разнообразного обучения. Эксперименты показывают, что компактные модели, обученные с помощью RIL, достигают производительности ведущих open-source и closed-source VLM, а в некоторых случаях превосходят их.",

"A unified reinforcement and imitation learning algorithm creates efficient, lightweight vision-language models that match or exceed leading VLMs in performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them."

NeuroAda is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that combines selective adaptation with bypass connections to achieve high performance with minimal trainable parameters and reduced memory usage.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former, such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e., connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen. Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance with as little as leq 0.02% trainable parameters, while reducing CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here: https://github.com/FightingFighting/NeuroAda.git.

AlphaOPT is a self-improving library that enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations and solver feedback, improving optimization modeling across industries without costly retraining.  					AI-generated summary 				 Optimization modeling enables critical decisions across industries but remains difficult to automate: informal language must be mapped to precise mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Prior LLM approaches either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone, without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts, extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition, explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights, and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data (65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only on answers.

RIR-Mega is a large dataset of simulated room impulse responses with tools for validation and a baseline model for predicting RT60 from waveforms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Room impulse responses are a core resource for dereverberation, robust speech recognition, source localization, and room acoustics estimation. We present RIR-Mega, a large collection of simulated RIRs described by a compact, machine friendly metadata schema and distributed with simple tools for validation and reuse. The dataset ships with a Hugging Face Datasets loader, scripts for metadata checks and checksums, and a reference regression baseline that predicts RT60 like targets from waveforms. On a train and validation split of 36,000 and 4,000 examples, a small Random Forest on lightweight time and spectral features reaches a mean absolute error near 0.013 s and a root mean square error near 0.022 s. We host a subset with 1,000 linear array RIRs and 3,000 circular array RIRs on Hugging Face for streaming and quick tests, and preserve the complete 50,000 RIR archive on Zenodo. The dataset and code are public to support reproducible studies.
