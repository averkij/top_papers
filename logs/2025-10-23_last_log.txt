[ 1 8 3 3 9 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r Figure 1 Benchmark results of Ring-flash-linear-2.0 versus counterparts on representative metrics.In recent years, Test-Time Scaling (Snell et al., 2024; Muennighoff et al., 2025) has significantly advanced the capability boundaries of Large Language Models(LLM). Models such as OpenAIs Oseries 1, DeepSeek R1 (Guo et al., 2025), Gemini 2.5 (Comanici et al., 2025), and the Qwen (Yang et al., 2025) Thinking series have achieved enhanced performance by scaling the number of decode tokens. Breakthroughs in reasoning models have also contributed to improvements in non-reasoning tasks. At the same time, growing demands for long-context support in core applications such as Agent systems and code generation have made extended context capability critical requirement for real-world model deployment. Amid this progress, two major challenges have emerged: both the training length and output length of language models must be substantially increased, leading to significant rise in overall resource consumption. Among the contributing factors, the attention mechanism stands out as key bottleneck. Traditional architectures such as MHA (Vaswani et al., 2017), GQA (Ainslie et al., 2023), MQA (Shazeer et al., 2017) and MLA (Liu et al., 2024a) exhibit rapidly growing resource overhead as sequence length increases, imposing considerable pressure on both I/O and computation. Specifically, the computational complexity of traditional Softmax Attention grows quadratically with sequence length, while I/O overhead increases linearly with output length. These constraints severely hinder the ability of models to scale to longer contexts. To address these challenges, research on Linear Attention has progressed rapidly. Approaches such as Mamba (Gu and Dao, 2024), Gated Linear Attention (Yang et al., 2023), and DeltaNet (Yang et al., 2024) have been introduced, achieving notable improvements in I/O and computational efficiency: computational complexity is reduced from O(n2d) to O(nd2), where is the sequence length, is the attention head dimension, and the space complexity of state memory becomes constant. These advances substantially enhance the efficiency of long-text processing and help control inference costs. However, Linear Attention still exhibits certain limitations in practical applications: Pure linear language models often underperform in industrial-scale scenarios, particularly as model parameter counts and sequence lengths increase. To mitigate this, hybrid architectures have gained adoption as balanced approachretaining portion of Softmax Attention in the model to maintain both efficiency and expressive power. Models such as Minimax M1 (Chen et al., 2025), GPT-OSS (Agarwal et al., 2025), and Qwen3-Next 2 have demonstrated promising results using this design. Although pure Linear Attention offers lower theoretical computational cost, its advantages only become pronounced at sequence lengths beyond 8K. However, the mainstream context length during pre-training typically remains in the 4K8K range. Moreover, with the growing adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectureswhich account for high proportion of computations at lengths below 8Kthe efficiency gains from Linear Attention during pre-training are further constrained. To address these issues, we developed the Ring-linear model series based on hybrid architecture, include two models: Ring-mini-linear-2.0 3 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0 4. Our contributions are 1https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini 2https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking 3https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI/Ring-mini-linear-2.0 4https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI/Ring-flash-linear-2.0 2 summarized as follows: We conducted systematic study of hybrid linear architectures during pre-training and established set of effective configuration guidelines. We implemented infrastructure-level optimizations for both pre-training and inference of hybrid linear models, achieving 50% improvement in training performance compare with the native blockwise FP8 mixed-precision training method provided by Megatron 5 and 90% increase in inference efficiency. Through systematic training-inference alignment for reinforcement learning, we significantly enhanced the stability of the model training process, and achieved stable long-horizon RL training. In the remainder of this paper, we first present our model architecture in Section 2. Computational efficiency optimizations during training and inference are detailed in Section 3. We then describe the continued pre-training and post-training procedures in Sections 4 an"

However, the research communitys progress remains constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, comprehensive 400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and diversity. We employ fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized subsets: (1) 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) 56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training; and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale, high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes robust foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided image editing models.

LoongRL, a data-driven reinforcement learning method, enhances long-context reasoning by transforming short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty tasks, improving accuracy and generalization in large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha" moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs. On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5) and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all 128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning capabilities.

Обучение на таких данных формирует у модели паттерн «планируй-ищи-рассуждай-перепроверяй», который обобщается далеко за пределы длины обучающих примеров.

DaMo, a trainable network optimizing data mixtures for Multimodal Large Language Models, enhances performance across various mobile phone tasks and benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited. Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo (Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57% in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably, DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/DaMo.git

olmOCR 2, a vision language model trained with reinforcement learning and verifiable rewards, achieves state-of-the-art performance in OCR tasks, particularly in math formula conversion, table parsing, and multi-column layouts.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present olmOCR 2, the latest in our family of powerful OCR systems for converting digitized print documents, like PDFs, into clean, naturally ordered plain text. olmOCR 2 is powered by olmOCR-2-7B-1025, a specialized, 7B vision language model (VLM) trained using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where our rewards are a diverse set of binary unit tests. To scale unit test creation, we develop a pipeline for generating synthetic documents with diverse and challenging layouts, known ground-truth HTML source code, and extracted test cases. We show that RL training on these test cases results in state-of-the-art performance on olmOCR-Bench, our English-language OCR benchmark, with the largest improvements in math formula conversion, table parsing, and multi-column layouts compared to previous versions. We release our model, data and code under permissive open licenses.

Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness, understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07, while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile, LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing methods in single editing scenarios.

ColorAgent, an OS agent using step-wise reinforcement learning and a multi-agent framework, achieves high success rates in long-horizon interactions and personalized user engagement on Android benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 With the advancements in hardware, software, and large language model technologies, the interaction between humans and operating systems has evolved from the command-line interface to the rapidly emerging AI agent interactions. Building an operating system (OS) agent capable of executing user instructions and faithfully following user desires is becoming a reality. In this technical report, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon, robust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and proactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the environment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise reinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a tailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and robustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent recognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an automation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on the AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2% and 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we note that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of OS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly in the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security. Our code is available at https://github.com/MadeAgents/mobile-use.

"ColorAgent, an OS agent using step-wise reinforcement learning and a multi-agent framework, achieves high success rates in long-horizon interactions and personalized user engagement on Android benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 With the advancements in hardware, software, and large language model technologies, the interaction between humans and operating systems has evolved from the command-line interface to the rapidly emerging AI agent interactions. Building an operating system (OS) agent capable of executing user instructions and faithfully following user desires is becoming a reality. In this technical report, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon, robust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and proactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the environment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise reinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a tailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and robustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent recognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an automation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on the AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2% and 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we note that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of OS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly in the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security. Our code is available at https://github.com/MadeAgents/mobile-use."

The Ring-linear model series, including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0, uses a hybrid architecture combining linear and softmax attention to reduce inference costs and improve training efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series, specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0. Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8 operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%. Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

KORE is a method for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old knowledge, using structured augmentations and covariance matrix constraints to minimize catastrophic forgetting.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their pre-trained weights. However, its knowledge remains static and limited, unable to keep pace with real-world developments, which hinders continuous knowledge acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention (preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B, LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

OmniNWM is a unified world model for autonomous driving that generates panoramic videos, encodes actions using Plucker ray-maps, and defines dense rewards based on 3D occupancy, achieving top performance in video generation, control, and stability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences, imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability, while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through occupancy-grounded rewards.

"OmniNWM is a unified world model for autonomous driving that generates panoramic videos, encodes actions using Plucker ray-maps, and defines dense rewards based on 3D occupancy, achieving top performance in video generation, control, and stability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences, imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability, while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through occupancy-grounded rewards.

Pico-Banana-400K is a large-scale, high-quality dataset for instruction-based image editing, featuring diverse edit pairs, multi-turn editing, preference subsets, and long-short instruction pairs, enabling comprehensive research and benchmarking.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive 400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a 56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training; and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale, high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided image editing models.

VideoAgentTrek automatically extracts GUI interaction data from YouTube videos using Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module, improving task success rates and step accuracy for computer-use agents.  					AI-generated summary 				 Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module (IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to expensive manual annotation.

TheMCPCompany evaluates tool-calling agents using REST APIs for interacting with real-world services, showing that advanced models perform well in simpler environments but struggle with complex enterprise environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly. These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs. However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next, we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments. TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval models.

FinSight, a multi-agent framework using CAVM architecture and iterative vision-enhanced mechanism, generates high-quality, multimodal financial reports with superior accuracy and presentation quality compared to existing systems.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generating professional financial reports is a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding process that current AI systems struggle to fully automate. To address this challenge, we introduce FinSight (Financial InSight), a novel multi agent framework for producing high-quality, multimodal financial reports. The foundation of FinSight is the Code Agent with Variable Memory (CAVM) architecture, which unifies external data, designed tools, and agents into a programmable variable space, enabling flexible data collection, analysis and report generation through executable code. To ensure professional-grade visualization, we propose an Iterative Vision-Enhanced Mechanism that progressively refines raw visual outputs into polished financial charts. Furthermore, a two stage Writing Framework expands concise Chain-of-Analysis segments into coherent, citation-aware, and multimodal reports, ensuring both analytical depth and structural consistency. Experiments on various company and industry-level tasks demonstrate that FinSight significantly outperforms all baselines, including leading deep research systems in terms of factual accuracy, analytical depth, and presentation quality, demonstrating a clear path toward generating reports that approach human-expert quality.
