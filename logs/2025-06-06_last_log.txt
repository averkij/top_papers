Angelopoulos Trevor Darrell Narges Norouzi Joseph E. GonzalezSearch-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However, analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn, fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around 12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not directly support the attributed claims, uncovering gap between perceived and actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources, revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by testing search-augmented LLMs in general-purpose chat environment and conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however, the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on the models parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future research in this direction. Search Arena Code DatasetLarge Language Models (LLMs) have become popular interface for humanAI interaction, supporting information seeking and task assistance through natural, multi-turn dialogue. However, the capabilities of these models are constrained by their reliance on static training data, which prevents them from effectively handling time-sensitive questions, emerging topics, or niche domains. Search-augmented LLMs aim to bridge this gap by retrieving and using live web data during inference. Access to search enables LLMs to provide up-to-date, domain-specific, and factually verifiable responses [24, 33]. Recent developments [16, 41, 47] also reflect the growing interest in search-augmented LLMs. Despite rapid progress in developing search-augmented LLMs, our understanding of how users interact with these systemswhat they ask, how they engage in multi-turn dialogue, and what they expect in returnremains limited. Existing datasets capture interactions with either standalone LLMs [10, 70, 71] or traditional web search engines [8, 13]. However, search-augmented LLMs represent hybrid interface different from both: they not only retrieve information through web search but also rely on their reasoning and conversational capabilities. The most widely used datasets for evaluating these systems (SimpleQA [60] and BrowseComp [61]) primarily consist of single-turn, monolingual, fact-based queries and are relatively small in scale (typically 5k queries). As shown in Figure 1, 1*Equal contribution. Preprint. Table 1: Comparison of Search Datasets. Unlike prior datasets such as SimpleQA [60] and BrowseComp [61], which consist of static, English-only, single-turn fact-seeking queries, Search Arena evaluates models in diverse, open-ended, multilingual, and multi-turn settings. We release 24,069 conversations including 12,652 human preference votes. Further analyses are provided in Section 2.

In-the-wild user prompts are often ambiguous and require real-time web retrieval. (Right) Distribution of intents across user prompts. The majority of queries require more than simple factual lookup and range from information synthesis to creative content generation. The Other category is excluded from the visualizations. fact-checking accounts for only one-fifth of real-world user queries; the majority of user prompts, such as seeking analyses, recommendations, or problem-solving guidance, require combination of factual retrieval, reasoning, and open-ended dialogue. User expectations also extend beyond factual correctness: preferences can be shaped by the number, relevance, and credibility of citations, as well as the presentation style of responses. To address these gaps, we crowd-sourced the first large-scale human-preference dataset of in-the-wild user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. We developed Search Arena, an open evaluation and data collection platform that presents anonymized side-by-side model outputs in multi-turn settings and collects human votes. During the seven-week deployment period, we gathered and publicly released 24,069 conversations, along with 12,652 paired preference judgments. The dataset spans 11,650 users across 136 countries, 13 models, around 70 languages (including 11% multilingual prompts), and over 5,000 multi-turn interactions. We also introduce user intent taxonomy in the context of search-enabled human-AI interactions. As detailed in Table 1 and Section 2, Search Arena provides broad coverage across linguistic and intent features. We not only analyze user prompts to search-augmented LLMs, but also their preferences. We model user preferences through the BradleyTerry model [5, 10, 55] and study how different response characteristics interact with user judgments. We find that reasoning, larger search context window, and longer responses are positively associated with user preferences. Since citations are central to the trustworthiness of web-grounded outputs, we also examine citation features. Our results show that users prefer responses with higher number of cited sources (Figure 4). In addition, users prefer model responses citing tech-related platforms, commu"

We present MARBLE, method for performing various material editing in images such as material blending (top row) and parametric control of material properties (bottom row) leveraging CLIP-space and pre-trained generative models. Given two material exemplar images, we can achieve controllable blend of materials on the object by blending the material representation in CLIP-space. For parametric material attribute control, we learn shallow network using synthetic data to predict the direction in CLIP-space for changing specific material properties such as metallic. "

Search Arena is a large-scale human-preference dataset that analyzes user interactions with search-augmented language models, revealing insights into citation influence and source credibility.  					AI-generated summary 				 Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However, analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn, fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around 12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources, revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however, the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/lmarena/search-arena.

MARBLE utilizes material embeddings in CLIP-space to control pre-trained text-to-image models for blending and recomposing material properties in images with parametric control over attributes.  					AI-generated summary 				 Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic, transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass and applicability to painting.   Project Page: https://marblecontrol.github.io/

We improve exemplar-based material editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic, transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass and applicability to painting.   Project Page: https://marblecontrol.github.io/"
