To accelerate research advancement in agentic systems, we are open-sourcing both our WebClick evaluation dataset and the Holo1 model weights.Building AI agents requires designing systems capable of acting in and adapting to dynamic digital environments in real time. In this context, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in reasoning and problem solving, rivaling or even surpassing human experts in domain-specific tasks [12, 32]. However, in their most fundamental form, LLMs are confined to static, pre-trained world: they cannot act, verify, or access up-to-date information. For instance, they cannot answer questions about current events, book restaurant table, or avoid hallucination [30, 35]. To circumvent their limitations, research has focused on enhancing LLMs with tool-use capabilities, enabling them to execute code snippets [7, 29], query Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) [18, 31], or retrieve information at scale with multi-step reasoning [33, 38, 24, 26]. These systems, often referred to 1 as agents, extend LLMs into more capable virtual assistants [36]. However, their real-world utility remains bounded by the available predefined tools and the engineering effort required to expand them [13]. Approaching this problem from another angle, computer use agents have recently emerged as new paradigm in which agents interact with software directly through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) [1, 8, 11, 15, 17, 23, 39], i.e. using the same interface humans are presented with. This approach avoids relying on custom integrations or APIs, opening the door to more adaptable general-purpose agents with higher potential and broader real-world utility. Here we present Surfer-H1, visual web retrieval agent designed to be easily trained through reinforcement learning techniques. Surfer-H comprises three main modules: policy, localizer, and validator, which act in sequence (see Section 2). These modules are compatible with any VLM capable of proposing and evaluating actions. Our agent only uses screenshots from websites and does not require the Document Object Model (DOM) or the accessibility tree of the websites. To deliver the best cost-performance ratio, we introduce Holo1, family of lightweight VLMs specialized in taking and evaluating actions and localizing UI elements. Holo1 was trained on carefully curated data sources, including open-access web content, synthetic examples, and self-produced agentic data. Holo1 is publicly available on Hugging Face2. Localization, the ability to identify the precise coordinates of User Interface (UI) components in screenshot, is core capability for effective web navigation and interaction. Existing benchmarks, such as Screenspot [4, 16, 34] and GroundUI [28], primarily focus on general UI localization across apps and platforms, but are not tailored to the unique challenges of web-based environments. These include complex, dynamic components like calendars and nested menus that frequently appear during web navigation. To fill this gap, we introduce WebClick, new benchmark specifically designed for web localizers, which we make publicly available on Hugging Face3. As detailed in Section 4, WebClick features specialized UI elements representative of the modern web, extracted from human-annotated data and agentic on-policy interactions. Our results show that Holo1 models excel at the aforementioned benchmarks. We evaluate Surfer-H on WebVoyager [11], mainstream benchmark for web retrieval, and compare the performance of Holo1 models against external baselines in Section 5. Our results show that the accuracy and cost-efficiency of the Holo1 models enable Surfer-H to achieve state-of-the-art performance at Pareto optimality.As displayed in Figure 1, Surfer-H relies on three trainable modules: policy, localizer, and validator. The policy proposes actions that are executed sequentially. Web actions are executed in browser by simulating human-like interactions. If the policy generates an action that requires interacting with specific element on webpage, such as like button, it generates textual description of the element, and the localizer provides its 2D coordinates. The policy can also decide that the task is complete and generate textual answer via dedicated action. When the policy emits an answer, it is passed through the validator. The validator generates feedback about the answer and decides whether it is suitable for the user. If the answer is valid, it is returned to the user. Otherwise, the feedback is incorporated to the agents memory, and the agent continues its execution until either completion or reaching time or cost budget. We describe the three modules and the role of the memory in greater detail below. Action Space and Policy Our agent is equipped with small action space: it can click on or type text into particular web components, scroll up and down, wait for page to load, refresh the page, go to given URL, go back, or return an answer. For given task and memory, Surfer-H decides which action to execute using its policy, specialized VLM. Each action is preceded by thought and, if de"

Text:"5 2 0 2 5 ] . [ 1 5 4 3 5 0 . 6 0 5 2 : r Inference-Time Hyper-Scaling with KV Cache Compression Adrian Łańcucki NVIDIA University of Edinburgh Konrad Staniszewski Piotr Nawrot* Edoardo M. Ponti Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs, generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the keyvalue (KV) cache, rather than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference. The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to achieve 8 compression, while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets. 1. Introduction Scaling inference-time computeemployed in models such as OpenAIs o1 (OpenAI et al., 2024) or DeepSeeks R1 (Guo et al., 2025)trades off increased inference time and memory for higher reasoning accuracy in large language models (LLMs).

INTRODUCTION Vision-based 3D occupancy prediction is task focused on estimating the semantic labels and occupancy states of each voxel in scene from visual inputs, helping autonomous vehicles perceive their 3D environment with centimeter-level precision. Despite the recent progress in dataset, models and benchmarks [1][3], accurately predicting the 3D occupancy grids is still highly challenging task. Recent approaches in 3D occupancy prediction, which we refer to as discriminative methods, directly learn mapping from images to occupancy grids and have become the de facto choice. However, there are inherent challenges in solving the 3D occupancy prediction task using discriminative methods: 1) The unique nature of predicting occupancy from visual inputssuch as the complex 3D structures, the intricate relationships between 3D labels and the existence of multimodal distributionsmakes this task distinct and more challenging compared to other supervised learning problems. However, discriminative methods directly learn the mapping from images to occupancy, rather than estimating the underlying distributions, which prevents them from incorporating prior knowledge of 3D scenes. This often leads to unrealistic and inconsistent results (refer to the black and orange circle in Fig. 1). Moreover, these methods fail to capture the multimodal nature of the distributions, increasing the burden on downstream tasks. 2) Obtaining perfect occupancy map labels is almost infeasible. Existing benchmarks like KITTI360 [26] and Occ3D [39] rely on equal contribution 1 Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University. 2 Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. Corresponding to: hangzhao@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn LiDAR scans from one or multiple traversals to create mesh reconstructions of scenes. However, partial observations and sensor noise lead to imperfect labels, which hinder effective model learning. Given these challenges, we believe that modeling occupancy prediction as generative modeling problem offers promising solution. By directly modeling the occupancy data distribution and performing conditional sampling, generative modeling captures the prior knowledge of complex 3D structures and semantics while naturally considering the inherent multi-modality of the occupancy prediction task. Furthermore, mainstream generative models, such as Diffusion Models exhibit inherent robustness to noise, which can mitigate the issue of harmful noise in occupancy labels. Moreover, generative models aim to model the underlying distribution of 3D world occupancy, rather than optimizing direct mapping from images to occupancy. This results in better generalization across scenarios with varying sensor setups, such as input images that differ from the training set or lack certain information. Motivated by this, we explore how to leverage diffusion including investigating models for occupancy prediction, how to perform generative modeling and conditional sampling, and explore other interesting properties. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that generative modeling for occupancy prediction offers series of powerful advantages over discriminative modeling. First, directly modeling the data distribution introduces strong prior for 3D scene occupancy, enhancing the models perceptual capabilities, resulting in more realistic, consistent, and accurate outcomes. For regions with high uncertainty, such as those with insufficient observation, occlusion, or high levels of noise, our model exhibits superior perceptual capabilities. Such holistic, uncertaintyaware, and multimodal-considerate perception results also better support downstream planning tasks, as shown by our experimental results. Our key contributions are summarized as follows: We frame occupancy prediction as process involving generative modeling followed by conditional sampling, from which we summarized four appealing properties compare to discriminative counterpart. We explore five key design aspects of utilizing conditional generative modeling for the occupancy prediction task. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that incorporating diffusion models can significantly improve the performance of occupancy prediction. The occuFig. 1: The diagram illustrates the occupancy data production process (a), the discriminative pipeline (b), and the generative pipeline (c). Black and orange circles highlight the deficiencies in the results from both the data production process and the discriminative pipeline, in contrast to the more reasonable results produced by the generative pipeline. pancy features generated by our method also benefit downstream planning tasks. II. FORMULATION We formulate the task of occupancy prediction using diffusion models [4][7], which can express complex multimodal distributions and exhibit robustness to noise. Below, we provide an overview of diffusion models and their adaptation for occupancy prediction. A. Diffusion Models Diffusion models progressively add noise to data and reverse this process to generate samples. For continuous data, the forward process adds Gaussian noise at each step: q(xtxt1) = (xt; (cid:112)1 βtxt1, βtI), (1) where βt controls the noise level at step t. The reverse process, parame"

Inference-time hyper-scaling with Dynamic Memory Sparsification in Transformer LLMs allows for increased token generation within the same compute budget by compressing the key-value cache, thereby enhancing accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs, generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference. The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to achieve 8times compression, while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

A novel 4D representation, FreeTimeGS, enhances the modeling of dynamic 3D scenes by enabling Gaussian primitives to appear at arbitrary times and locations, improving rendering quality compared to existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.

Accurately predicting 3D occupancy grids from visual inputs is critical for autonomous driving, but current discriminative methods struggle with noisy data, incomplete observations, and the complex structures inherent in 3D scenes. In this work, we reframe 3D occupancy prediction as a generative modeling task using diffusion models, which learn the underlying data distribution and incorporate 3D scene priors. This approach enhances prediction consistency, noise robustness, and better handles the intricacies of 3D spatial structures. Our extensive experiments show that diffusion-based generative models outperform state-of-the-art discriminative approaches, delivering more realistic and accurate occupancy predictions, especially in occluded or low-visibility regions. Moreover, the improved predictions significantly benefit downstream planning tasks, highlighting the practical advantages of our method for real-world autonomous driving applications.

Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.
