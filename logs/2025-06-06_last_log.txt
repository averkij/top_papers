Analyzing advantages of language-specific pre-training Marianne de Heer Kloots1, Hosein Mohebbi2, Charlotte Pouw1, Gaofei Shen2, Willem Zuidema1, Martijn Bentum3 1Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands 2Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence, Tilburg University, The Netherlands 3Centre for Language Studies, Radboud University, Netherlands m.l.s.deheerkloots@uva.nl, H.Mohebbi@tilburguniversity.edu, c.m.pouw@uva.nl, G.Shen@tilburguniversity.edu, w.h.zuidema@uva.nl, martijn.bentum@ru.nl 5 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 1 8 9 0 0 . 6 0 5 2 : r Abstract How language-specific are speech representations learned by self-supervised models? Existing work has shown that range of linguistic features can be successfully decoded from end-toend models trained only on speech recordings. However, its less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pretraining exclusively on Dutch improves the representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or classification probes, and partially observable using zeroshot metrics. Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition. Index Terms: interpretability, language-specificity, speech recognition self-supervised learning, 1. Introduction In recent years, self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been demonstrated to learn powerful representations of spoken language, in terms of both their downstream task performance and the richness of their embedding spaces. Despite being trained only on unlabeled spee"

Scaling laws are derived for CLIP and MaMMUT to compare their performance and sample efficiency across different scales and datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT, that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost. Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves 80.3% zero-shot ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B.

Most existing vision encoders map images into a fixed-length sequence of tokens, overlooking the fact that different images contain varying amounts of information. For example, a visually complex image (e.g., a cluttered room) inherently carries more information and thus deserves more tokens than a simple image (e.g., a blank wall). To address this inefficiency, we propose DOVE, a dynamic vision encoder that produces a variable number of visual tokens (i.e., continuous representation vectors) to reconstruct each image. Our results show that DOVE significantly reduces the average number of tokens while maintaining high reconstruction quality. In several linear probing and downstream multimodal tasks, it outperforms existing autoencoder-based tokenization methods when using far fewer tokens, capturing more expressive semantic features compared to fixed-length encoding. We further extend DOVE with query-conditioned tokenization. By guiding the model to focus on query-relevant regions, it achieves more efficient and targeted semantic extraction. Our code and checkpoints are available at https://dove-encoder.github.io/dove-encoder.

Self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models encode Dutch linguistic features more accurately when pre-trained exclusively on Dutch data, compared to similar amounts of English or multilingual data, as shown by clustering and classification probes, and demonstrated through improved Automatic Speech Recognition performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 How language-specific are speech representations learned by self-supervised models? Existing work has shown that a range of linguistic features can be successfully decoded from end-to-end models trained only on speech recordings. However, it's less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pre-training exclusively on Dutch improves the representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or classification probes, and partially observable using zero-shot metrics. Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition.

"Self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models encode Dutch linguistic features more accurately when pre-trained exclusively on Dutch data, compared to similar amounts of English or multilingual data, as shown by clustering and classification probes, and demonstrated through improved Automatic Speech Recognition performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 How language-specific are speech representations learned by self-supervised models? Existing work has shown that a range of linguistic features can be successfully decoded from end-to-end models trained only on speech recordings. However, it's less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pre-training exclusively on Dutch improves the representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or classification probes, and partially observable using zero-shot metrics. Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition."
