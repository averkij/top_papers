Text:"Fietje: An open, efficient LLM for Dutch Bram Vanroy1,2 bram.vanroy@kuleuven.be 1KU Leuven, Blijde Inkomststraat 21, 3000 Leuven, Belgium 2Dutch Language Institute, Rapenburg 61, 2311 GJ Leiden, The Netherlands Abstract This paper introduces Fietje, family of small language models (SLMs) specifically designed for the Dutch language. The model is based on Phi 2, an English-centric model of 2.7 billion parameters. Fietje demonstrated competitive results with larger language models upon its release. core emphasis of this work is transparency and reproducibility: Fietje is fully open-source, with model weights, datasets, training, and evaluation code all publicly accessible. The paper discusses the performance of Fietje and many other models on an extensive evaluation suite of benchmarks on reasoning, sentiment analysis, world knowledge, linguistic acceptability and word sense disambiguation. Evaluation results illustrate the rapid progress in the field of LLMs, where recent small models outperform older, larger models that were fine-tuned for Dutch. This trend signals an exciting future for Dutch language processing, suggesting that even compact LLMs are becoming increasingly capable. Furthermore, ongoing and future efforts to adapt LLMs to Dutch are poised to enhance these models even further, broadening their applicability and accessibility. Fietje is only an intermediate step in improving accessibility to language technology for users of the Dutch language. 1. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, demonstrating remarkable proficiency across various tasks, including generation tasks as well as zero-shot classification or annotation. However, their performance has predominantly focused on English, leaving other languages underrepresented. For this reason, we introduce Fietje, continued pretraining model that adapts the predominantly English-focused phi-2 (Javaheripi et al. 2023) Small Language Model (SLM) of 2.7 bil"
