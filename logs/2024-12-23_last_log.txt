Sajjadi Ross Goroshin George-Cristian Muraru Joao Carreira Google DeepMind Corresponding author: viorica@google.com, core contributor Figure 1. Left: TRecViT architecture. Each video frame is divided into non-overlapping patches that are linearly projected into token embedding space. We then add learnt spatial positional encoding. The tokens are passed through gated linear recurrent units (LRUs) that share parameters across space. The outputs of the recurrent blocks are then processed by ViT block. The recurrent operation followed by ViT is repeated times. Right: TRecViT block. The input is batch of videos, each frame with tokens. We apply recurrent units over temporal tubes to integrate information over time, and self-attention and MLP across tokens within each frame. Note that the recurrent units share parameters, but the information is not mixed across temporal tubes. Similarly, the ViT blocks share parameters, but the information is not mixed across frames. "

We propose a novel block for video modelling. It relies on a time-space-channel factorisation with dedicated blocks for each dimension: gated linear recurrent units (LRUs) perform information mixing over time, self-attention layers perform mixing over space, and MLPs over channels. The resulting architecture TRecViT performs well on sparse and dense tasks, trained in supervised or self-supervised regimes. Notably, our model is causal and outperforms or is on par with a pure attention model ViViT-L on large scale video datasets (SSv2, Kinetics400), while having 3times less parameters, 12times smaller memory footprint, and 5times lower FLOPs count.
