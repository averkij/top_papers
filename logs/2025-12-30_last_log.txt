These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling the students to achieve strong performance without requiring the thinkanswer process. Extensive experiments across diverse VLM benchmarks demonstrate that Masters outperforms existing compact VLMs and partially surpasses large ones, while being far more efficient. Moreover, gradually increasing the teacher sizes during distillation (e.g., from 14B to 38B) yields smoother convergence and stronger generalization than one-shot distillation (e.g., 38B), revealing scalable path toward efficient and deployable VLMs. Figure 1 Comparing Masters-applied VLMs with diverse openand closed-source VLMs across broad model sizes for averaged performance (%) of numerous evaluation benchmarks: AI2D [1], ChartQA [2], MathVista [3], MMB [4], MM-Vet [5], MMMU [6], MMMU-Pro [7], MMStar [8], BLINK [9], SEED-Bench [10], SEED-Bench-2-Plus [11], and RealWorldQA. 1. Introduction years, In recent visionlanguage models (VLMs) [13, 14] have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across wide range of multimodal tasks [15], including visual captioning, reasoning, and open-ended question answering.

In addition, we show (c) the effect of RL under naive and mask-progressive distillation. Note that asterisk (*) represents the combined distillation of mid-size and large teacher. that in some domains approach human-level understanding [16]. However, these achievements come at the cost of massive model sizes [17, 18, 19, 12] and heavy computational requirements, making them impractical for deployment on mobile or edge devices [20]. As the demand for on-device intelligence continues to grow, there is an urgent need for compact yet powerful VLMs [21, 22, 23, 24] that can deliver competitive performance while maintaining high efficiency and deployability [25, 26]. widely adopted approach for building such lightweight yet capable models is knowledge distillation [27, 28], where large teacher transfers its knowledge to smaller student. Despite its promise, distillation remains challenging due to the substantial size gap between teacher and student [29, 30, 31]. The student often struggles to reproduce the teachers rich and high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and significant performance degradation [32, 33, 34]. Recent distillation has explored modified training objectives [35, 36, 37, 38], dynamic intermediatelayer distillation [39, 40], vision-attention distillation [41, 42], multi-step distillation [43, 44], crosstoken general distillation [45, 46], and reinforcement learning (RL)based approaches [47, 48, 49]. However, few works have directly addressed the fundamental issue of the large size gap itself. To tackle this challenge, we first mask nondominant weights of the teacher based on their magnitudes [50], thereby reducing unnecessary complexity. This is because the large number of weights in the teacher is core factor that makes distillation difficult. After masking the weights in the teacher, we perform the knowledge distillation progressively where the teacher is gradually restored from the mask throughout the entire training to increase the teachers representation complexity. This mask-progressive strategy enables the student to first capture coarse-grained patterns and subsequently refine them into more detailed and higher-level representations, thereby learning richer and more complex representations of the teacher in smooth and stable manner. Furthermore, we identify critical limitations in existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets [51, 52, 53], where answer labels are typically generated by large closed-source models with an extremely large number of parameters, such as GPT-4o [14], Gemini [54], or Claude [55], and often filtered by humans [56]. Small student, however, has limited capacity to learn these rich answer labels due to its smaller vocabulary and lower hidden dimension of representation [57, 58]. To address this, we utilize the generated responses from masked teachers instead of directly using standard SFT samples. This enables the 2 Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student for Distilling Vision-Language Models Figure 3 Overview of mask-progressive distillation where teacher is masked with decreasing masking ratio (0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05, 0), gradually restoring "

Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have recently achieved remarkable multimodal understanding, but their massive size makes them impractical for deployment on mobile or edge devices. This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teachers. However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student. Unlike online think-answer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling students to achieve strong performance without requiring the think-answer process.
