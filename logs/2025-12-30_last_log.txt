Text:"SmartSnap SmartSnap: Proactive Evidence Seeking for Self-Verifying Agents Youtu-Agent Team Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for the development of autonomous agents under complex GUI tasks, but its scalability remains severely hampered by the verification of task completion. Existing task verification is treated as passive, post-hoc process: verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agents entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models. The synergizing between solution finding and evidence seeking facilitates the cultivation of efficient, self-verifying agents with competitive performance against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

Code and models are available at https://daniellli. github.io/projects/DKT/. I. INTRODUCTION Accurate depth estimation of transparent and reflective objects is fundamental to advancing 3D reconstruction [1] the intrinsic and robotic manipulation [2]. Nevertheless, physical ambiguities of these objects impose substantial limitations on depth-sensing cameras that rely on time-offlight measurements or stereo correspondence [3], [4]. In particular, transparent objects often produce missing regions 1Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, scxu@baai.ac.cn 2University of Southern California. 3Tsinghua University, zhaohao@air.tsinghua.edu.cn. 4Beihang University. 5Wuhan University. 6Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 7European Institute of Innovation and Technology Ningbo. 8FNii, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. 9National University of Singapore.

Our method achieves robust depth estimation for transparent objects in arbitrary-length, in-the-wild videos. For the full video, please refer to the Appendix video. in depth maps, which in turn lead to degraded performance in downstream tasks. Recent data-driven approaches have sought to address this challenge by constructing datasets [5] that encompass diverse lighting conditions and material properties, thereby approximating the visual characteristics of transparent and specular objects, and subsequently training models for depth prediction [4], [6]. However, such datasets remain constrained in diversity, and the resulting methods frequently exhibit suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. We hypothesize that these methods tend to overfit to the limited datasets on which they are trained. To address the generalization challenge, recent works [4], [7] have increasingly leveraged pre-trained vision encoders, such as DINO [8], or harnessed text-to-image foundation models like Stable Diffusion [9] to train depth estimation networks. While these approaches have achieved notable improvements in single-frame depth accuracy, they continue to suffer from lack of temporal consistency across frame sequences [10]. This limitation is particularly detrimental to downstream tasks that rely on stable 3D perception to support consistent action policies, such as robotic manipulation [11], [12]. These tasks are often carried out in dynamic and unstructured environments, where robust perception and temporally coherent decision-making are indispensable. With recent advances in Video Diffusion Model (VDM) [13], [14], we observe their remarkable capacity to synthesize physically plausible videos of interactions with transparent objects, as illustrated in the first column of Fig. 2. Our central insight is that these models appear to have implicitly internalized the physical principles of light transportsuch as refraction and reflection through transparent or translucent materials. To leverage this knowledge for video depth estimation of transparent-object, we make contributions from two perspectives: data and learning. Data. We collect 3D asset collection consisting of diverse categories and shapes of transparent and highly reflective items. Subsequently, we introduce rendering pipeline that automatically generates physically plausible scenes using these assets and renders video data with varied light sources and camera trajectories, leading to the first synthetic video dataset, termed TransPhy3D, which focuses on transparent-objects, complementing existing image counterparts [4], [15], [16] that primarily study single-frame depth estimation problem. Learning. We propose paradigm shift to video depth estimation: reframing it from discriminative estimation task to video-to-video translation problem. We achieve this by repurposing VDM [14] using LoRA training strategy. To fully leverage existing frame-wise datasets, we introduce co-training strategy that enables joint training on mixture of frame-wise and video data. Finally, we introduce foundation model designed primarily for video depth estimation of transp"

Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments, but the world is constructed primarily through generation, making it harder to maintain fixed, deterministic global framework, reducing controllability. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), middle ground where world state and physics are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build suite of WWMs on realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulationand game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments. 5 2 0 2 9 2 ] .

The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements due to the open-ended nature of the task. Moreover, verification of research plans by executing experiments is slow and expensive to obtain. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader, accessing the rubrics as privileged information to evaluate plans generated by the training policy. This setup creates generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours.

To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, fully audioguided active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized tools to achieve more fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows 1Zhejiang University 2Westlake University 3Ant Group. Correspondence to: Huan Wang <wanghuan@westlake.edu.cn>, Jian Liu <rex.lj@antgroup.com>. Preprint. December 30, 2025. 1 and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on taskrelevant cues. Central to our approach is novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy. OmniAgent: Audio-Guided Active Perception Agent for Omnimodal Audio-Video Understanding 1. Introduction Recently, end-to-end omnimodal large language models (OmniLLMs) have achieved encouraging results by integrating visual and audio encoders into unified architecture (Tang et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024c; Xu et al., 2025a;b; Yang et al., 2025b; Ge et al., 2025; Shu et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025c; Shu et al., 2025; AI et al., 2025). Despite this progress, as shown in Figure 2(a), OmniLLMs still struggle with in fine-grained cross-modal understanding, and the joint alignment training of audio and video representations poses significant challenges (Galougah et al., 2025; Chowdhury et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2023). Consequently, models often cannot respond accurately. critical empirical observation is that while MLLMs have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in unimodal tasks (Wang et al., 2025a; Team et al., 2025; Bai et al., 2025b; Wang et al., 2024a; Chu et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2025; Bai et al., 2025a), cross-modal understanding remains constrained by the challenges of temporal and feature alignment (Chowdhury et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2025; Fan et al., 2025). Consequently, developing agent-based frameworks to synergize the capabilities of distinct modalities is now promising direction. Although preliminary investigations into agentic audio-visual understanding exist (Cao et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025), current approaches rely predominantly on static workflows, as illustrated in Figure 2(b). These methods not only incur substantial computational overhead but also face challenges in fully leverage the inherent thinking capabilities of models for dynamic planning, thereby precluding genuine fine-grained understanding. Recent works have yielded significant advancements in agent-based video understanding (Zhang et al., 2025; 2024b; Fan et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b; Yang et al., 2025d; Wang et al., 2025c; Pang & Wang, 2025; Wang et al., 2025d; Chowdhury et al., 2025; Yin et al., 2025). Specifically, temporal event localization is paramount for fine-grained analysis. Prevailing approaches predominantly rely on frame-captioning, where captions are generated for sampled frames, stored, and subsequently retrieved and analyzed iteratively by agents (Wang et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025c). While these methods refine their hypotheses through multi-step inference, they incur substantial computational overhead. Sometimes, even worse, the generated caption of the frames may be irrelevant to the query. However, in the context of audio-visual understanding, the audio modality presents distinct challenges yet offers unique opportunity: unlike redundant visual signals, audio naturally provides accurate and concise temporal cues regarding the salient events (Guo et al., 2025; Tao et al., 2025). These cues can efficiently guide agent-based event localization, thereby facilitating more accurate fine-grained understanding at low cost. Figure 2. (a) End-to-end OmniLLMs implicitly fuse modalities but suffer from high training costs, difficult alignment, and limited fine-grained reasoning. (b) Fixed workflow agents rely on rigid pipelines, lacking the flexibility to allocate attention for finegrained analysis adaptively. (c) Caption-based agents incur high precomputation costs and noise sensitivity, often failing to capture comprehensive multimodal context. (d) Our OmniAgent employs active perception reasoning and inquiry. Within an iterative reflective loop, the agent strategically calls on the ability of video and audio understandi"

While largescale visionlanguageaction (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video-action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action-Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. Its able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos.

However, while textual and static multimodal agents have seen rapid progress, significant modality gap remains in processing the webs most dynamic modality: video. Existing video benchmarks predominantly focus on passive perception, feeding curated clips to models without requiring external retrieval. They fail to evaluate agentic video research, which necessitates actively interrogating video timelines, cross-referencing dispersed evidence, and verifying claims against the open web. To bridge this gap, we present Video-BrowseComp, challenging benchmark comprising 210 questions tailored for open-web agentic video reasoning. Unlike prior benchmarks, Video-BrowseComp enforces mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence, ensuring that answers cannot be derived solely through text search but require navigating video timelines to verify external claims. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals critical bottleneck: even advanced search-augmented models like GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) achieve only 15.24% accuracy. Our analysis reveals that these models largely rely on textual proxies, excelling in metadatarich domains (e.g., TV shows with plot summaries) but collapsing in metadata-sparse, dynamic environments (e.g., sports, gameplay) where visual grounding is essential.

Linderman2,3, Christopher Re1, Dan Biderman1,2,3 1Department of Computer Science, Stanford University 2Department of Statistics, Stanford University 3Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute, Stanford University {shizhehe}@stanford.edu Abstract Agentic language model (LM) systems power modern applications like Deep Research and Claude Code, and leverage multi-LM architectures to overcome context limitations. Beneath their apparent diversity lies recurring pattern: smaller compressor LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger predictor LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as noisy channel, we introduce simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is 1.6 more accurate, 4.6 more concise, and conveys 5.5 more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors.

To address these challenges, we propose \method, a novel framework designed to generate realistic, interactive, and continuous worlds from a single image or text prompt. \method achieves this through a carefully designed framework that supports keyboard-based exploration of the generated worlds. The framework comprises three core components: (1) a long-video generation framework integrating unified context compression with linear attention; (2) a real-time streaming acceleration strategy powered by bidirectional attention distillation and an enhanced text embedding scheme; (3) a text-controlled method for generating world events. We have provided the codebase in the supplementary material."

Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for the development of autonomous agents under complex GUI tasks, but its scalability remains severely hampered by the verification of task completion. Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models. The synergizing between solution finding and evidence seeking facilitates the cultivation of efficient, self-verifying agents with competitive performance against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

Transparent objects remain notoriously hard for perception systems: refraction, reflection and transmission break the assumptions behind stereo, ToF and purely discriminative monocular depth, causing holes and temporally unstable estimates. Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: "Diffusion knows transparency." Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.

An expert-router coupling (ERC) loss aligns router decisions with expert capabilities in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by enforcing constraints on internal activations, improving performance and computational efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models lack explicit constraints to ensure the router's decisions align well with the experts' capabilities, which ultimately limits model performance. To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs.

"An expert-router coupling (ERC) loss aligns router decisions with expert capabilities in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by enforcing constraints on internal activations, improving performance and computational efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models lack explicit constraints to ensure the router's decisions align well with the experts' capabilities, which ultimately limits model performance. To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs."

Web World Models (WWMs) combine web frameworks with large language models to create controllable, open-ended persistent environments by structuring world state in web code and leveraging model-driven imagination for narratives and decisions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Language agents increasingly require persistent worlds in which they can act, remember, and learn. Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

AI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.

Information-seeking (IS) agents have achieved strong performance across a range of wide and deep search tasks, yet their tool use remains largely restricted to API-level snippet retrieval and URL-based page fetching, limiting access to the richer information available through real browsing. While full browser interaction could unlock deeper capabilities, its fine-grained control and verbose page content returns introduce substantial complexity for ReAct-style function-calling agents. To bridge this gap, we propose Nested Browser-Use Learning (NestBrowse), which introduces a minimal and complete browser-action framework that decouples interaction control from page exploration through a nested structure. This design simplifies agentic reasoning while enabling effective deep-web information acquisition. Empirical results on challenging deep IS benchmarks demonstrate that NestBrowse offers clear benefits in practice. Further in-depth analyses underscore its efficiency and flexibility.

Omnimodal large language models have made significant strides in unifying audio and visual modalities; however, they often lack the fine-grained cross-modal understanding and have difficulty with multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, a fully audio-guided active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized tools to achieve more fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy.

Data scarcity remains a fundamental barrier to achieving fully autonomous surgical robots. While large scale vision language action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos. We are also the first to use an inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic surgical videos, producing synthetic paired video action data. We demonstrate that a surgical VLA policy trained with these augmented data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform. Our approach offers a scalable path toward autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging the abundance of unlabeled surgical video and generative world modeling, thus opening the door to generalizable and data efficient surgical robot policies.

The paper addresses the modality gap in autonomous agents for video processing by introducing a benchmark requiring proactive, open-web video reasoning, revealing limitations of current models in metadata-sparse, dynamic video domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 The evolution of autonomous agents is redefining information seeking, transitioning from passive retrieval to proactive, open-ended web research. However, while textual and static multimodal agents have seen rapid progress, a significant modality gap remains in processing the web's most dynamic modality: video. Existing video benchmarks predominantly focus on passive perception, feeding curated clips to models without requiring external retrieval. They fail to evaluate agentic video research, which necessitates actively interrogating video timelines, cross-referencing dispersed evidence, and verifying claims against the open web. To bridge this gap, we present Video-BrowseComp, a challenging benchmark comprising 210 questions tailored for open-web agentic video reasoning. Unlike prior benchmarks, Video-BrowseComp enforces a mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence, ensuring that answers cannot be derived solely through text search but require navigating video timelines to verify external claims. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a critical bottleneck: even advanced search-augmented models like GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) achieve only 15.24\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals that these models largely rely on textual proxies, excelling in metadata-rich domains (e.g., TV shows with plot summaries) but collapsing in metadata-sparse, dynamic environments (e.g., sports, gameplay) where visual grounding is essential. As the first open-web video research benchmark, Video-BrowseComp advances the field beyond passive perception toward proactive video reasoning.

Agentic language model (LM) systems power modern applications like "Deep Research" and "Claude Code," and leverage multi-LM architectures to overcome context limitations. Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller "compressor" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger "predictor" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is 1.6times more accurate, 4.6times more concise, and conveys 5.5times more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors. Applied to a Deep Research system, these principles enable local compressors as small as 3B parameters to recover 99% of frontier-LM accuracy at 26% of API costs.

"Agentic language model (LM) systems power modern applications like "Deep Research" and "Claude Code," and leverage multi-LM architectures to overcome context limitations. Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller "compressor" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger "predictor" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is 1.6times more accurate, 4.6times more concise, and conveys 5.5times more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors. Applied to a Deep Research system, these principles enable local compressors as small as 3B parameters to recover 99% of frontier-LM accuracy at 26% of API costs."
