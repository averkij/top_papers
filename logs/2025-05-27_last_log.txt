[ 1 5 4 5 8 1 . 5 0 5 2 : r B-score: Detecting biases in large language models using response history An Vo 1 Mohammad Reza Taesiri 2 Daeyoung Kim 1 * Anh Totti Nguyen 3 *Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit strong biases, e.g., against women or in favor of the number 7. We investigate whether LLMs would be able to output less biased answers when allowed to observe their prior answers to the same question in multi-turn conversation. To understand which types of questions invite more biased answers, we test LLMs on our proposed set of questions that span 9 topics and belong to three types: (1) Subjective; (2) Random; and (3) Objective. Interestingly, LLMs are able to de-bias themselves in multi-turn conversation in response to questions that seek an Random, unbiased answer. Furthermore, we propose Bscore, novel metric that is effective in detecting biases to Subjective, Random, Easy, and Hard questions. On MMLU, HLE, and CSQA, leveraging B-score substantially improves the verification accuracy of LLM answers (i.e., accepting LLM correct answers and rejecting incorrect ones) compared to using verbalized confidence scores or the frequency of single-turn answers alone. Code and data are available at: b-score.github.io. (a) B-score indicates is biased towards option 7 and 4. 1. Introduction LLMs can be notoriously biased towards gender, race, profession, number, name, or even birth year (Zhang et al., 2024; Sheng et al., 2019b). These biases are often identified by repeatedly asking LLMs the same question (where there are 2 correct answers) and checking if one answer appears much more frequently than others. An LLM is considered biased if one answer appears more often than the others in such single-turn conversations (Fig. 1b). We find that biased responses can appear at different temperatures *Equal advising 1KAIST, South Korea 2University of Alberta, Canada 3Auburn University, USA.

(b) Three single-turn convos (c) multi-turn convo Figure 1: When asked to output random number, GPT-4o often answers 7 (b), 70% of the time (a). In contrast, in multi-turn conversations where the LLM observes its past answers to the same question, it is able to de-bias itself, choosing the next numbers such that all numbers in history form nearly uniform distribution (b) at 10% chance (a). (Appendix B.1), but most frequently at temp=0. Such biased responses could exist because LLMs are asked only once and the same highest-probability answer appears again in the next single-turn conversation due to greedy decoding (Fig. 1b). Therefore, we ask: Would an LLM be able to de-bias itself if it is allowed to observe its prior responses to the same question? Interestingly, the answer is: Yes. For example, instead of 70% of the time choosing the number 7, GPT-4o would output every number from 0 to 9 at near-random chance in multi-turn conversations 1 B-score: Detecting biases in large language models using response history (Fig. 1c). GPT-4os single-turn and multi-turn reFigure 2: sponse probabilities for the politics topic (Trump vs. Biden) across 10 runs under four categories. In the single-turn setting P(single), the model shows similarly skewed distribution for the Subjective and Random questions (favoring Biden). However, in the multi-turn setting, chooses random answers in Random (P(multi) 0.5) while still favoring Biden in Subjective (P(multi) 1.0). The distribution of Easy questions remains identical (correct answers dominating) across both settings. In contrast, Hard question exhibits wider spread and different behavior between settings. In the multi-turn setting, returns consistent preference in Subjective, random answers in Random, consistently correct answers to Easy questions, and variable answers to Hard questions. We conjecture that there may be multiple types of biases in LLMs (1) bias due to actual preferences; (2) consistently selecting the wrong answer because the question is too hard; and (3) bias learned from imbalanced training data. Yet, most prior research focused on the third type (Sheng et al., 2019b). Here, we propose novel test framework where we ask LLMs the same set of questions across 9 topics but in 4 different wordings that ask for (1) subjective opinion ; (2) random choice ; (3) an objective answer to an easy question ; (4) an answer to hard question  (Fig. 2)  . Leveraging the insight that LLMs can become substantially less biased given their response history, we propose B-score, metric that identifies biased answers without requiring access to groundtruth labels. B-score is computed for each answer returned by an LLM and is the between the probability that appears in single-turn runs vs. that in multi-turn runs. The main findings from our experiments ), Geminiacross 8 LLMsGPT-4o ( and 1.5-Pro ( ), Gemini-1.5-Flash ( ), GPT-4o-mini ( ), Llama-3.1 ( ), Command ( ), and Command R+ ( +)are: 2 1. Across all 4 question categories, biases may diminish in multi-turn settings, i.e. some common LLM biases can be mitigated with response history (Sec. 5.1). 2. The B-score effectively captures bias in model responses, providing metric that can help the user understand and detect biases that appear in single-turn questions (Secs. 5.1 and 5.2). 3. Verbalized confidence scores generated by LLMs are not as good an indicator for bias as our B-score (Sec. 5.3). 4. Using B-score as an extra indicator for whether an LLM is being biased to decide to accept or reject an LLM decision results in substantially higher answerverification accuracy, by +9.3 on our proposed questions and +2.9 on common benchmarks (MMLU, HLE and CSQA) (Sec. 5.4). 2.

(2019)) have been shown reflecting societal stereotypes) into exhibit biases (i.e. herited from their training corpora (Sheng et al., 2019a). Subsequent studies have documented biases in numerous dimensions, including demographic biases (e.g. gender, race, religion, culture, etc.) (Brown et al., 2020; Abid et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2024; Shin et al., 2024), political biases (Bang et al., 2024; Potter et al., 2024), geographical bias"

Text:"Vibe Coding vs. Agentic Coding: Fundamentals and Practical Implications of Agentic AI Ranjan Sapkota, Konstantinos I. Roumeliotis, Manoj Karkee Cornell University, Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering, USA University of the Peloponnese, Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, Tripoli, Greece Corresponding authors: rs2672@cornell.edu, mk2684@cornell.edu 5 2 0 2 6 2 ] . [ 1 3 4 4 9 1 . 5 0 5 2 : r AbstractThis review presents comprehensive analysis of two emerging paradigms in AI-assisted software development: vibe coding and agentic coding. While both leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy, architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes intuitive, human-inthe-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks with minimal human intervention. We propose detailed taxonomy spanning conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms, debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we articulate future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm, but on harmonizing their strengths within unified, human-centered development lifecycle.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in visual tasks, including semantic scene understanding and text-image alignment, with reasoning variants enhancing performance on complex tasks involving mathematics and logic. However, their capacity for reasoning tasks involving fine-grained visual understanding remains insufficiently evaluated. To address this gap, we introduce ReasonMap, a benchmark designed to assess the fine-grained visual understanding and spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ReasonMap encompasses high-resolution transit maps from 30 cities across 13 countries and includes 1,008 question-answer pairs spanning two question types and three templates. Furthermore, we design a two-level evaluation pipeline that properly assesses answer correctness and quality. Comprehensive evaluations of 15 popular MLLMs, including both base and reasoning variants, reveal a counterintuitive pattern: among open-source models, base models outperform reasoning ones, while the opposite trend is observed in closed-source models. Additionally, performance generally degrades when visual inputs are masked, indicating that while MLLMs can leverage prior knowledge to answer some questions, fine-grained visual reasoning tasks still require genuine visual perception for strong performance. Our benchmark study offers new insights into visual reasoning and contributes to investigating the gap between open-source and closed-source models.

"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in visual tasks, including semantic scene understanding and text-image alignment, with reasoning variants enhancing performance on complex tasks involving mathematics and logic. However, their capacity for reasoning tasks involving fine-grained visual understanding remains insufficiently evaluated. To address this gap, we introduce ReasonMap, a benchmark designed to assess the fine-grained visual understanding and spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ReasonMap encompasses high-resolution transit maps from 30 cities across 13 countries and includes 1,008 question-answer pairs spanning two question types and three templates. Furthermore, we design a two-level evaluation pipeline that properly assesses answer correctness and quality. Comprehensive evaluations of 15 popular MLLMs, including both base and reasoning variants, reveal a counterintuitive pattern: among open-source models, base models outperform reasoning ones, while the opposite trend is observed in closed-source models. Additionally, performance generally degrades when visual inputs are masked, indicating that while MLLMs can leverage prior knowledge to answer some questions, fine-grained visual reasoning tasks still require genuine visual perception for strong performance. Our benchmark study offers new insights into visual reasoning and contributes to investigating the gap between open-source and closed-source models."

Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit strong biases, e.g, against women or in favor of the number 7. We investigate whether LLMs would be able to output less biased answers when allowed to observe their prior answers to the same question in a multi-turn conversation. To understand which types of questions invite more biased answers, we test LLMs on our proposed set of questions that span 9 topics and belong to three types: (1) Subjective; (2) Random; and (3) Objective. Interestingly, LLMs are able to "de-bias" themselves in a multi-turn conversation in response to questions that seek an Random, unbiased answer. Furthermore, we propose B-score, a novel metric that is effective in detecting biases to Subjective, Random, Easy, and Hard questions. On MMLU, HLE, and CSQA, leveraging B-score substantially improves the verification accuracy of LLM answers (i.e, accepting LLM correct answers and rejecting incorrect ones) compared to using verbalized confidence scores or the frequency of single-turn answers alone. Code and data are available at: https://b-score.github.io.

VLM-Gym addresses the "knowing-doing" gap in Vision-Language Models by training them in a diverse RL environment, leading to enhanced perception and reasoning abilities that surpass existing models in interactive games.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in many direct multimodal tasks but struggle to translate this prowess into effective decision-making within interactive, visually rich environments like games. This ``knowing-doing'' gap significantly limits their potential as autonomous agents, as leading VLMs often performing badly in simple games. To address this, we introduce VLM-Gym, a curated reinforcement learning (RL) environment featuring diverse visual games with unified interfaces and adjustable, compositional difficulty, specifically designed for scalable multi-game parallel training. Leveraging VLM-Gym, we train G0 models using pure RL-driven self-evolution, which demonstrate emergent perception and reasoning patterns. To further mitigate challenges arising from game diversity, we develop G1 models. G1 incorporates a perception-enhanced cold start prior to RL fine-tuning. Our resulting G1 models consistently surpass their teacher across all games and outperform leading proprietary models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking. Systematic analysis reveals an intriguing finding: perception and reasoning abilities mutually bootstrap each other throughout the RL training process. Source code including VLM-Gym and RL training are released at https://github.com/chenllliang/G1 to foster future research in advancing VLMs as capable interactive agents.

PathFinder-PRM, a hierarchical and error-aware Process Reward Model, improves mathematical problem-solving by fine-grained error classification and step correctness estimation, achieving state-of-the-art PRMScore with reduced data usage.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, especially during multi-hop and reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematical problem solving. While Outcome Reward Models verify only final answers, Process Reward Models (PRMs) score each intermediate step to steer generation toward coherent solutions. We introduce PathFinder-PRM, a novel hierarchical, error-aware discriminative PRM that first classifies math and consistency errors at each step, then combines these fine-grained signals to estimate step correctness. To train PathFinder-PRM, we construct a 400K-sample dataset by enriching the human-annotated PRM800K corpus and RLHFlow Mistral traces with three-dimensional step-level labels. On PRMBench, PathFinder-PRM achieves a new state-of-the-art PRMScore of 67.7, outperforming the prior best (65.5) while using 3 times less data. When applied to reward guided greedy search, our model yields prm@8 48.3, a +1.5 point gain over the strongest baseline. These results demonstrate that decoupled error detection and reward estimation not only boost fine-grained error detection but also substantially improve end-to-end, reward-guided mathematical reasoning with greater data efficiency.

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Existing systems rely on a one-way information transmission mode where patients must fully describe their symptoms in a single round, leading to nonspecific diagnostic recommendations when complaints are vague. Traditional multi-turn dialogue methods based on supervised learning are constrained by static data-driven paradigms, lacking generalizability and struggling to intelligently extract key clinical information. To address these limitations, we propose DoctorAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent, dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient interactions. Experiments demonstrate that DoctorAgent-RL outperforms existing models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic performance, demonstrating practical value in assisting clinical consultations. https://github.com/JarvisUSTC/DoctorAgent-RL

A review contrasts vibe coding and agentic coding paradigms, highlighting their differences in interaction, autonomy, and application areas in AI-assisted software development.  					AI-generated summary 				 This review presents a comprehensive analysis of two emerging paradigms in AI-assisted software development: vibe coding and agentic coding. While both leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy, architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms, debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm, but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development lifecycle.

Standing in 2025, at a critical juncture in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) and has led to the development of cutting-edge AI models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Moreover, the efficient application of RFT to enhance the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has attracted widespread attention from the community. In this position paper, we argue that reinforcement fine-tuning powers the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models. To begin with, we provide a detailed introduction to the fundamental background knowledge that researchers interested in this field should be familiar with. Furthermore, we meticulously summarize the improvements of RFT in powering reasoning capability of MLLMs into five key points: diverse modalities, diverse tasks and domains, better training algorithms, abundant benchmarks and thriving engineering frameworks. Finally, we propose five promising directions for future research that the community might consider. We hope that this position paper will provide valuable insights to the community at this pivotal stage in the advancement toward AGI. Summary of works done on RFT for MLLMs is available at https://github.com/Sun-Haoyuan23/Awesome-RL-based-Reasoning-MLLMs.

Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have been largely fueled by massive speech corpora. However, extending coverage to diverse languages with limited resources remains a formidable challenge. This paper introduces Speech Back-Translation, a scalable pipeline that improves multilingual ASR models by converting large-scale text corpora into synthetic speech via off-the-shelf text-to-speech (TTS) models. We demonstrate that just tens of hours of real transcribed speech can effectively train TTS models to generate synthetic speech at hundreds of times the original volume while maintaining high quality. To evaluate synthetic speech quality, we develop an intelligibility-based assessment framework and establish clear thresholds for when synthetic data benefits ASR training. Using Speech Back-Translation, we generate more than 500,000 hours of synthetic speech in ten languages and continue pre-training Whisper-large-v3, achieving average transcription error reductions of over 30\%. These results highlight the scalability and effectiveness of Speech Back-Translation for enhancing multilingual ASR systems.
