[ 1 1 8 0 5 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r Figure 1. We train Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) to lift the text embeddings into higher-dimensional space, where we identify disentangled semantic directions (e.g. for laughing). These directions can then be applied to specific tokens within the input of text-to-image model to facilitate continuous image editing. As shown on the right, our token-level editing steers the model to incorporate the relevant attribute (laughing) into the subject in the image that corresponds to the chosen token (e.g., woman or kid), while allowing the attributes intensity to be continuously adjusted through scale factor, ωt.

Text:"LLMSQL: Upgrading WikiSQL for the LLM Era of Text-to-SQL 1st Dzmitry Pihulski Department of Artificial Intelligence Wroclaw University of Science and Technology Wroclaw, Poland dzmitry.pihulski@pwr.edu.pl 2nd Karol Charchut Trusted Artificial Intelligence Wroclaw University of Science and Technology Wroclaw, Poland karol.charchut.dev@gmail.com 3rd Viktoria Novogrodskaia Trusted Artificial Intelligence Wroclaw University of Science and Technology Wroclaw, Poland novogrodskaiaviktoria@gmail.com 4th Jan Kocon Department of Artificial Intelligence Wroclaw University of Science and Technology Wroclaw, Poland jan.kocon@pwr.edu.pl AbstractConverting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset its usage has played key role in early NL2SQL research, declined due to structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies, data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present LLMSQL, systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral 7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

Imperceptible jailbreaks using Unicode variation selectors enable high attack success rates against aligned LLMs without visible prompt modifications.  					AI-generated summary 				 Jailbreaking attacks on the vision modality typically rely on imperceptible adversarial perturbations, whereas attacks on the textual modality are generally assumed to require visible modifications (e.g., non-semantic suffixes). In this paper, we introduce imperceptible jailbreaks that exploit a class of Unicode characters called variation selectors. By appending invisible variation selectors to malicious questions, the jailbreak prompts appear visually identical to original malicious questions on screen, while their tokenization is "secretly" altered. We propose a chain-of-search pipeline to generate such adversarial suffixes to induce harmful responses. Our experiments show that our imperceptible jailbreaks achieve high attack success rates against four aligned LLMs and generalize to prompt injection attacks, all without producing any visible modifications in the written prompt. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/imperceptible-jailbreaks.

A method for disentangled and continuous text-to-image editing uses token-level manipulation of text embeddings with sparse autoencoders to control image attributes smoothly.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have become the backbone of modern image editing, yet text prompts alone do not offer adequate control over the editing process. Two properties are especially desirable: disentanglement, where changing one attribute does not unintentionally alter others, and continuous control, where the strength of an edit can be smoothly adjusted. We introduce a method for disentangled and continuous editing through token-level manipulation of text embeddings. The edits are applied by manipulating the embeddings along carefully chosen directions, which control the strength of the target attribute. To identify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically isolated dimensions. Our method operates directly on text embeddings without modifying the diffusion process, making it model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image synthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables intuitive and efficient manipulations with continuous control across diverse attributes and domains.

"A method for disentangled and continuous text-to-image editing uses token-level manipulation of text embeddings with sparse autoencoders to control image attributes smoothly.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have become the backbone of modern image editing, yet text prompts alone do not offer adequate control over the editing process. Two properties are especially desirable: disentanglement, where changing one attribute does not unintentionally alter others, and continuous control, where the strength of an edit can be smoothly adjusted. We introduce a method for disentangled and continuous editing through token-level manipulation of text embeddings. The edits are applied by manipulating the embeddings along carefully chosen directions, which control the strength of the target attribute. To identify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically isolated dimensions. Our method operates directly on text embeddings without modifying the diffusion process, making it model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image synthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables intuitive and efficient manipulations with continuous control across diverse attributes and domains."

MoME, a novel framework integrating sparse Mixture-of-Experts into Matryoshka representation learning, enhances audio-visual speech recognition by dynamically adjusting capacity across scales and modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR), but their high computational demands and sensitivity to token granularity limit their practicality in resource-constrained settings. Token compression methods can reduce inference cost, but they require fixing a compression rate in advance and produce a single fixed-length output, offering no flexibility to balance information density and efficiency at inference time. Matryoshka representation learning (MRL) addresses this by enabling a single model to operate across multiple token granularities, allowing compression rates to be adjusted dynamically. However, current MRL-based methods treat each scale independently during training, limiting cross-scale generalization, robustness at high compression, and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoME (Mixture of Matryoshka Experts), a novel framework that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into MRL-based LLMs for AVSR. MoME augments a frozen LLM with top-k routed and shared experts, allowing dynamic capacity allocation across scales and modalities. A shared router promotes consistent expert activation across granularities, enabling compressed sequences to benefit from representations learned at lower compression. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 demonstrate that MoME achieves state-of-the-art performance across AVSR, ASR, and VSR tasks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and maintaining robustness under noise. MoME unifies the adaptability of MRL with the efficiency of MoE, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for resource-aware speech recognition.

LLMSQL is a revised and cleaned version of WikiSQL designed for modern large language models, providing clean questions and full SQL queries for straightforward evaluation in text-to-SQL tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Converting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset played a key role in early NL2SQL research, its usage has declined due to structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies, data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral 7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.
