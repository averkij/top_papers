Text:"5 2 0 2 1 ] . [ 1 1 6 1 1 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r Prosperity before Collapse: How Far Can Off-Policy RL Reach with Stale Data on LLMs? Haizhong Zheng1, Jiawei Zhao2, Beidi Chen1 1Carnegie Mellon University 2Meta AI {haizhonz, beidic}@cmu.edu, jwzhao@meta.com Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability. Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in rollout data, setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover prosperity-before-collapse phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates. Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and matches on-policy performance. Github: https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/M2PO/ Website: https://infini-ai-lab.github.io/M2PO/ Figure 1 Comparison of on-policy GRPO and off-policy training under staleness of 256 model updates on Qwen-2.5-32B. Left: Standard GRPO suffers from degradation with stale rollouts, while removing the trust region (GRPO no TR) reveals clear prosperity-before-collapse phenomenon. In contrast, M2PO achieves stable training and matches on-policy performance even under high staleness. Right: Token clipping ratio "

[ 1 4 3 4 3 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r Paris: Decentralized Trained Open-Weight Diffusion Model Zhiying Jiang, Raihan Seraj, Marcos Villagra, Bidhan Roy* Bagel Labs bagel.com We present Paris, the first publicly released diffusion model pre-trained entirely through decentralized computation. Paris demonstrates that high-quality text-to-image generation can be achieved without centrally coordinated infrastructure. Paris is open for research and commercial use. Paris required implementing our Distributed Diffusion Training framework from scratch. The model consists of 8 expert diffusion models (129M-605M parameters each) trained in complete isolation with no gradient, parameter, or intermediate activation synchronization. Rather than requiring synchronized gradient updates across thousands of GPUs, we partition data into semantically coherent clusters where each expert independently optimizes its subset while collectively approximating the full distribution. lightweight transformer router dynamically selects appropriate experts at inference, achieving generation quality comparable to centrally coordinated baselines. Eliminating synchronization enables training on heterogeneous hardware without specialized interconnects. Empirical validation (Section 3) confirms that Pariss decentralized training maintains generation quality while removing the dedicated GPU cluster requirement for large-scale diffusion models. Paris achieves this using 14 less training data and 16 less compute than the prior decentralized baseline (Table 3, Figure 3). bageldotcom/paris bageldotcom/paris silver car on brick road surrounded by palm trees Sunset over calm ocean crystal-clear alpine lake reflecting the majestic mountain photograph of majestic garden beautiful landscape peaceful garden with blooming cherry trees cozy cabin in snowy forest Abstract art with vibrant colors and geometric shapes high-resolution photograph of golden retriever puppy running through meadow high-quality photogra"

M2PO, a reinforcement learning algorithm, enables stable off-policy training with stale data by constraining the second moment of importance weights, achieving performance comparable to on-policy methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability. Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates. Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and matches on-policy performance.

Paris, a decentralized diffusion model, achieves high-quality text-to-image generation without centralized infrastructure using a distributed training framework and a transformer router.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Paris, the first publicly released diffusion model pre-trained entirely through decentralized computation. Paris demonstrates that high-quality text-to-image generation can be achieved without centrally coordinated infrastructure. Paris is open for research and commercial use. Paris required implementing our Distributed Diffusion Training framework from scratch. The model consists of 8 expert diffusion models (129M-605M parameters each) trained in complete isolation with no gradient, parameter, or intermediate activation synchronization. Rather than requiring synchronized gradient updates across thousands of GPUs, we partition data into semantically coherent clusters where each expert independently optimizes its subset while collectively approximating the full distribution. A lightweight transformer router dynamically selects appropriate experts at inference, achieving generation quality comparable to centrally coordinated baselines. Eliminating synchronization enables training on heterogeneous hardware without specialized interconnects. Empirical validation confirms that Paris's decentralized training maintains generation quality while removing the dedicated GPU cluster requirement for large-scale diffusion models. Paris achieves this using 14times less training data and 16times less compute than the prior decentralized baseline.

The paper discusses underexplored privacy risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond verbatim memorization, including data collection, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent capabilities, and surveillance through deep inference attacks, and calls for a broader interdisciplinary approach to address these threats.  					AI-generated summary 				 The discourse on privacy risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) has disproportionately focused on verbatim memorization of training data, while a constellation of more immediate and scalable privacy threats remain underexplored. This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM systems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from data collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent capabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference attacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM lifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through case studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted threats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers published at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal that while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the most pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches offer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear. We call for a fundamental shift in how the research community approaches LLM privacy, moving beyond the narrow focus of current technical solutions and embracing interdisciplinary approaches that address the sociotechnical nature of these emerging threats.
