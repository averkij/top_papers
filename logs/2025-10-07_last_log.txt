Text:"5 2 0 2 5 ] . [ 1 9 9 3 4 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r Utility-Learning Tension in Self-Modifying Agents Charles L. Wang Keir Dorchen Peter JinAs systems trend toward superintelligence, natural modeling premise is that agents can selfimprove along every facet of their own design. We formalize this with five-axis decomposition and decision layer, separating incentives from learning behavior and analyzing axes in isolation. Our central result identifies and introduces sharp utilitylearning tension, the structural conflict in self-modifying systems whereby utility-driven changes that improve immediate or expected performance can also erode the statistical preconditions for reliable learning and generalization. Our findings show that distribution-free guarantees are preserved iff the policy-reachable model family is uniformly capacity-bounded; when capacity can grow without limit, utility-rational self-changes can render learnable tasks unlearnable. Under standard assumptions common in practice, these axes reduce to the same capacity criterion, yielding single boundary for safe self-modification. Numerical experiments across several axes validate the theory by comparing destructive utility policies against our proposed two-gate policies that preserve learnability.Classical learning theoryfrom realizable and agnostic PAC to information-theoretic and computational analysesrests on tacit premise: the learning mechanism is architecturally invariant. Parameters may adapt, but the agents update rules, representational scaffolding, topology, computational substrate, and meta-reasoning are treated as fixed. As capabilities trend toward strong open-ended autonomy, however, it is increasingly realistic to assume that advanced agents will self-improve broadly, rewriting not just weights but the very mechanisms by which they learn. Evidence for this shift already exists. Reinforcement learning and meta-learning instantiate constrained self-change (Sutton and Barto, 2018; Finn et al., 2017; Rajeswaran et al., 2019; Hospedales et al., 2022), while open-ended pipelines iterate code edits and tools (Zhang et al., 2025). Decisiontheoretic proposals investigate provably utility-improving modifications (Schmidhuber, 2005), safety analyses document pathologies (Orseau and Ring, 2011), and metagoal frameworks aim to stabilize goal evolution (Goertzel, 2024). What remains underdeveloped is learning-theoretic account of post-modification behavior: when do seemingly rational self-changes preserve the conditions under which learning is possible, and when do they destroy them? We prove policy-level learnability boundary: distribution-free PAC guarantees are preserved iff the policy-reachable family has uniformly bounded capacity. simple Two-Gate guardrail (validation margin τ + capacity cap K(m)) keeps trajectories on the safe side and yields VC-rate oracle inequality. 1 Our Contributions. Policy boundary (iff ). Under standard i.i.d. assumptions, distribution-free PAC learnability is preserved under self-modification iff the policy-reachable family has uniformly bounded capacity (VC/pseudodim). Axis reductions. Architectural and metacognitive edits reduce to induced hypothesis families; substrate changes matter only via the induced family. Hence the boundary depends solely on the supremum capacity of the reachable family. Two-Gate guardrail. computable accept/reject rule (validation improvement by margin τ + capacity cap K(m)) ensures monotone true-risk steps and an oracle inequality at VC rates for the final predictor.Godel Machines give proof-based framework for globally optimal self-modification under utility function (Schmidhuber, 2005). Safety analyses document pathologies for self-modifying agents, including reward hacking and self-termination (Orseau and Ring, 2011). Open-ended empirical systems iterate code and toolchain edits with benchmark gains but without proof obligations (Zhang et al., 2025). Proposals for metagoals aim to stabilize or moderate goal evolution during self-change (Goertzel, 2024). While these frameworks establish decision-theoretic foundations, they do not provide learning-theoretic guarantees about post-modification generalization. We study the learning-theoretic state of the agent after such edits. 2.2 Modern mechanisms for self-improvement Contemporary machine learning exhibits constrained forms of self-modification across multiple dimensions. Neural architecture search explores architectural topologies through differentiable, evolutionary, and reinforcement approaches (Liu et al., 2019; Elsken et al., 2019; Zoph and Le, 2017; Real et al., 2019). Automated machine learning systems perform pipeline and hyperparameter search and can trigger optimizer and model-family switches (Hutter et al., 2019; Feurer and Hutter, 2019; Li et al., 2017). Population-based training simultaneously evolves hyperparameters and weights across population of models (Jaderberg et al., 2017). Meta-learning adapts optimizers, initializations, and inductive biases across tasks (Finn et al., 2017; Rajeswaran et al., 2019; Hospedales et al., 2022). Reinforcement learning and multi-armed bandits provide policies for selecting modifications and exploration strategies (Sutton and Barto, 2018; Auer et al., 2002; Lai and Robbins, 1985; Slivkins, 2019). Representation growth through mixture of experts and adapters, and the use of external memory and retrieval, expand the effective function family and computation available at inference (Fedus et al., 2022; Houlsby et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2021; Graves et al., 2014, 2016; Lewis et al., 2020; Schick et al., 2023). Continual learning addresses sequential task acquisition while mitigating catastrophic forgetting (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Parisi et al., 2019; Van de Ven and Tolias, 2022). These mechanisms instantiate partial self-modificationadapting specific components while keeping the learning framework itself fixed. In contrast, true self-modifying agents can rewrite any axis of their design. In our framework, these mechanisms traverse representational, architectural, algorithmic, and metacognitive axes, and we establish when such traversals preserve or destroy learnability. 2.3 Learning theory for adaptive systems PAC learning provides distribution-free guarantees under fixed hypothesis class and algorithm (Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David, 2014; Mohri et al., 2018; Blumer et al., 1989; Vapnik, 1998; Hanneke et al., 2024).

[ 1 1 6 5 3 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r Reactive Transformer (RxT) - Stateful Real-Time Processing for Event-Driven Reactive Language Models Adam Filipek (adamfilipek@rxai.dev) Reactive AI (https://rxai.dev) October 2025 Abstract The Transformer architecture has become the de facto standard for Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. However, its application in conversational AI is fundamentally constrained by its stateless nature and the quadratic computational complexity (O(L2)) with respect to sequence length L. Current models emulate memory by reprocessing an ever-expanding conversation history with each turn, leading to prohibitive costs and latency in long dialogues. This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), novel architecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from data-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn as discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated, fixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features distinct operational cycle where generator-decoder produces response based on the current query and the previous memory state, after which memory-encoder and dedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with representation of the complete interaction. This design fundamentally alters the scaling dynamics, reducing the total user-facing cost of conversation from quadratic (O(N 2 )) to linear (O(N )) with respect to the number of interactions . By decoupling response generation from memory updates, RxT achieves low latency, enabling truly real-time, stateful, and economically viable long-form conversations. We validated our architecture with series of proof-of-concept experiments on synthetic data, demonstrating superior performance and constant-time inference latency compared to baseline stateless model of comparable size.

Introducing reasoning data during pretraining significantly enhances LLM performance compared to post-training, with pretraining benefiting more from diverse data patterns while SFT benefits more from high-quality data.  					AI-generated summary 				 The prevailing paradigm for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs revolves around post-training on high-quality, reasoning-intensive data. While emerging literature suggests that reasoning data is increasingly incorporated also during the mid-training stage-a practice that is relatively more proprietary and less openly characterized-the role of such data in pretraining remains unclear. In particular, due to the opaqueness of pretraining corpora in most frontier models, the effect of reasoning data introduced at different phases of pre- and/or post-training is relatively less reported in the scientific literature. This raises several important questions: Is adding reasoning data earlier during pretraining any better than introducing it during post-training? Could earlier inclusion risk overfitting and harm generalization, or instead establish durable foundations that later fine-tuning cannot recover? We conduct the first systematic study of how reasoning data-varying in scale, diversity, and quality-affects LLM performance when introduced at different stages of training. We find that front-loading reasoning data into pretraining is critical (19% avg gain), establishing foundational capabilities that cannot be fully replicated by later-stage SFT, even with more data. We uncover an asymmetric principle for optimal data allocation: pretraining benefits most from broad diversity in reasoning patterns (11% avg gain), while SFT is more sensitive to data quality (15% avg gain). We show that high-quality pretraining data has latent effects, activated only after SFT, and that naively scaling SFT data can be detrimental, washing away the benefits of early reasoning injection. Our results challenge the conventional separation of language modeling and reasoning, providing a principled guide for strategically allocating data across the entire training pipeline to build more capable models.

Self-improving systems face a utility-learning tension that can degrade their ability to learn and generalize, requiring capacity bounds to ensure safe self-modification.  					AI-generated summary 				 As systems trend toward superintelligence, a natural modeling premise is that agents can self-improve along every facet of their own design. We formalize this with a five-axis decomposition and a decision layer, separating incentives from learning behavior and analyzing axes in isolation. Our central result identifies and introduces a sharp utility--learning tension, the structural conflict in self-modifying systems whereby utility-driven changes that improve immediate or expected performance can also erode the statistical preconditions for reliable learning and generalization. Our findings show that distribution-free guarantees are preserved iff the policy-reachable model family is uniformly capacity-bounded; when capacity can grow without limit, utility-rational self-changes can render learnable tasks unlearnable. Under standard assumptions common in practice, these axes reduce to the same capacity criterion, yielding a single boundary for safe self-modification. Numerical experiments across several axes validate the theory by comparing destructive utility policies against our proposed two-gate policies that preserve learnability.

The Reactive Transformer (RxT) addresses the limitations of stateless Transformers in conversational AI by using an event-driven paradigm with a fixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system, achieving linear scaling and low latency.  					AI-generated summary 				 The Transformer architecture has become the de facto standard for Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. However, its application in conversational AI is fundamentally constrained by its stateless nature and the quadratic computational complexity (O(L^2)) with respect to sequence length L. Current models emulate memory by reprocessing an ever-expanding conversation history with each turn, leading to prohibitive costs and latency in long dialogues. This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), a novel architecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from a data-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn as a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated, fixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features a distinct operational cycle where a generator-decoder produces a response based on the current query and the previous memory state, after which a memory-encoder and a dedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with a representation of the complete interaction. This design fundamentally alters the scaling dynamics, reducing the total user-facing cost of a conversation from quadratic (O(N^2 cdot T)) to linear (O(N cdot T)) with respect to the number of interactions N. By decoupling response generation from memory updates, RxT achieves low latency, enabling truly real-time, stateful, and economically viable long-form conversations. We validated our architecture with a series of proof-of-concept experiments on synthetic data, demonstrating superior performance and constant-time inference latency compared to a baseline stateless model of comparable size.

"The Reactive Transformer (RxT) addresses the limitations of stateless Transformers in conversational AI by using an event-driven paradigm with a fixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system, achieving linear scaling and low latency.  					AI-generated summary 				 The Transformer architecture has become the de facto standard for Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. However, its application in conversational AI is fundamentally constrained by its stateless nature and the quadratic computational complexity (O(L^2)) with respect to sequence length L. Current models emulate memory by reprocessing an ever-expanding conversation history with each turn, leading to prohibitive costs and latency in long dialogues. This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), a novel architecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from a data-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn as a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated, fixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features a distinct operational cycle where a generator-decoder produces a response based on the current query and the previous memory state, after which a memory-encoder and a dedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with a representation of the complete interaction. This design fundamentally alters the scaling dynamics, reducing the total user-facing cost of a conversation from quadratic (O(N^2 cdot T)) to linear (O(N cdot T)) with respect to the number of interactions N. By decoupling response generation from memory updates, RxT achieves low latency, enabling truly real-time, stateful, and economically viable long-form conversations. We validated our architecture with a series of proof-of-concept experiments on synthetic data, demonstrating superior performance and constant-time inference latency compared to a baseline stateless model of comparable size."
