Text:"5 2 0 2 6 ] . [ 1 5 9 9 4 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r Power Transform Revisited: Numerically Stable, and Federated Xuefeng Xu University of Warwick xuefeng.xu@warwick.ac.uk Graham Cormode University of Warwick g.cormode@warwick.ac.uk October 7, 2025 Abstract Power transforms are popular parametric techniques for making data more Gaussian-like, and are widely used as preprocessing steps in statistical analysis and machine learning. However, we find that direct implementations of power transforms suffer from severe numerical instabilities, which can lead to incorrect results or even crashes. In this paper, we provide comprehensive analysis of the sources of these instabilities and propose effective remedies. We further extend power transforms to the federated learning setting, addressing both numerical and distributional challenges that arise in this context. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods are both effective and robust, substantially improving stability compared to existing approaches. Power transforms are widely used to stabilize variance and reduce skewness, and are described in textbooks as foundational tools for data preprocessing. Among them, the Box-Cox (Box and Cox, 1964) and Yeo-Johnson (Yeo and Johnson, 2000) transforms are the most prominent, and are frequently employed in statistical analysis and machine learning pipelines (Ruppert, 2001; Fink, 2009). Despite their popularity, directly implementing these mathematical functions leads to serious numerical instability issues, producing erroneous outputs or even causing program crashes. This is not theoretical concern: as we show in Table 1, simple inputs can easily provoke such failures. The issue has been identified in prior work such as the MASS package (Venables and Ripley, 2002), but only partial solutions have been proposed. Recently, this issue was raised by Marchand et al. (2022). Unfortunately, their analysis includes some incorrect claims and unsound solutions. As shown in Figure "

Text:"5 2 0 2 6 ] . [ 1 9 7 9 4 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r a Xuefeng Xu University of Warwick xuefeng.xu@warwick.ac.uk Graham Cormode University of Warwick g.cormode@warwick.ac.uk October 7, 2025 Abstract Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves are fundamental tools for evaluating machine learning classifiers, offering detailed insights into the trade-offs between true positive rate vs. false positive rate (ROC) or precision vs. recall (PR). However, in Federated Learning (FL) scenarios, where data is distributed across multiple clients, computing these curves is challenging due to privacy and communication constraints. Specifically, the server cannot access raw prediction scores and class labels, which are used to compute the ROC and PR curves in centralized setting. In this paper, we propose novel method for approximating ROC and PR curves in federated setting by estimating quantiles of the prediction score distribution under distributed differential privacy. We provide theoretical bounds on the Area Error (AE) between the true and estimated curves, demonstrating the trade-offs between approximation accuracy, privacy, and communication cost. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves high approximation accuracy with minimal communication and strong privacy guarantees, making it practical for privacy-preserving model evaluation in federated systems. Federated learning (FL) (Kairouz et al., 2021b) is distributed machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train model without sharing their raw, heterogenous data. This framework is particularly valuable in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance. However, current FL evaluation tools often rely on simple metrics like accuracy and loss, as implemented in frameworks like Flower (Beutel et al., 2020). These metrics, while useful during training, provide an incomplete picture of model performance. Accuracy, in particular, is "

Power transforms are extended to federated learning to improve numerical stability and robustness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Power transforms are popular parametric techniques for making data more Gaussian-like, and are widely used as preprocessing steps in statistical analysis and machine learning. However, we find that direct implementations of power transforms suffer from severe numerical instabilities, which can lead to incorrect results or even crashes. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the sources of these instabilities and propose effective remedies. We further extend power transforms to the federated learning setting, addressing both numerical and distributional challenges that arise in this context. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods are both effective and robust, substantially improving stability compared to existing approaches.

A method for approximating ROC and PR curves in federated learning under distributed differential privacy ensures high accuracy, minimal communication, and strong privacy guarantees.  					AI-generated summary 				 Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves are fundamental tools for evaluating machine learning classifiers, offering detailed insights into the trade-offs between true positive rate vs. false positive rate (ROC) or precision vs. recall (PR). However, in Federated Learning (FL) scenarios, where data is distributed across multiple clients, computing these curves is challenging due to privacy and communication constraints. Specifically, the server cannot access raw prediction scores and class labels, which are used to compute the ROC and PR curves in a centralized setting. In this paper, we propose a novel method for approximating ROC and PR curves in a federated setting by estimating quantiles of the prediction score distribution under distributed differential privacy. We provide theoretical bounds on the Area Error (AE) between the true and estimated curves, demonstrating the trade-offs between approximation accuracy, privacy, and communication cost. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves high approximation accuracy with minimal communication and strong privacy guarantees, making it practical for privacy-preserving model evaluation in federated systems.
