[ 1 6 2 2 4 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r aLarge language models (LLMs) tend to generate lexically, semantically, and stylistically homogenous texts. This poses risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs mediate shrinking in the range of accessible information over time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by focus on closed-ended multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform broad empirical study of LLM knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than basic web search. We find that model size has negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting gap in epistemic representation.Large language models (LLMs) are being adopted for knowledge-intensive tasks such as summarization (Wright et al., 2025), writing assistance (Sun et al., 2025), and research (Si et al., 2025). Search interfaces are now prioritizing AI Overviews to answer queries. It is speculated that people will Figure 1: In this work, we measure epistemic diversity via variability in claims about the world for characterizing knowledge collapse in LLMs. soon access most information through an LLM intermediary (Peterson, 2025). At the same time, recent studies have noted that LLM outputs are homogeneous (Sourati et al., 2025b). For example, LLMs reflect only narrow range of writing and reasoning styles, use limited vocabulary (Sourati et al., 2025a) and convey only certain semantics (Lee et al., 2025). This phenomenon, where models regress to central tendency, also affects knowledge i.e., the pieces of information that models tend to generate (Dutta and Chakraborty, 2023). This could in turn limit the information available to the general public and subsequently dwindle our collective knowledge, phenomenon broadly defined as knowledge collapse  (Fig. 1)  .2 Recent work (Peterson, 2025) has begun to theorize this, but offers limited empirical data. To better characterize and understand this problem, we investigate, for the first time, whether LLMs themselves exhibit knowledge collapse. To do so, we perform an empirical study measuring epistemic diversity, defined as the diver1Code and data: https://github.com/dwright37/ 2For an in depth definition and discussion, see Peterson llm-knowledge (2025). sity of claims about the world in given corpus (e.g., set of LLM responses). To measure this, we develop new methodology intended to reveal the diversity of claims occurring in free-text LLM outputs. This involves (1) sampling outputs from LLMs using set of 200 natural writing assistance prompts collected from Röttger et al. (2025), (2) partitioning the LLM responses into unique classes of semantically equivalent claims (Farquhar et al., 2024), and (3) quantifying the diversity of the sample of claims with Hill-Shannon diversity, widely used metric for measuring species diversity in ecology (Roswell et al., 2021). From among the Llama, Gemma, Qwen, and OpenAI model families, we study 27 LLMs spanning multiple versions, sizes, and release dates, querying them for 155 topics. For the selected topics, while we find that epistemic diversity has increased since 2023 for three of four model families, it remains low for all models compared to rudimentary web search. Similar to contemporary work (Zhang et al., 2025), we find that model size has statistically significant negative impact on epistemic diversity smaller models generate more diverse knowledge than larger ones. In contrast, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has statistically significant positive impact, highlighting the importance of RAG in preventing future knowledge collapse. For country-specific topics, we find that RAG has an uneven effect; certain countries (e.g., the USA) see more benefit due to greater diversity in their RAG sources. Finally, compared to traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia) in both English and local languages for country-specific topics, we find that the claims generated in our study reflect English language knowledge more than local language knowledge, highlighting gap in epistemic representation.LLMs are increasingly being used for knowledgecentric tasks (Yang et al., 2024), and can influence peoples behavior (Anderson et al., 2024; Jakesch et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2025a). Hence, lack of diversity in LLMs outputs may reduce the diversity in our collective knowledge. Our work studies this risk through the lenses of LLM homogenization and knowledge collapse. sity includes lexical and stylistic (Sourati et al., 2025a), semantic (Lee et al., 2025), creative (Xu et al., 2025), and perspective diversity (Wright et al., 2024; Abdurahman et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025; Durmus et al., 2023; Röttger et al., 2024; Moore et al., 2024). Our work is most similar to perspective diversity, which has shown that LLMgenerated views, opinions, and beliefs tend to reflect only small subset of the world (Durmus et al., 2023; Atari et al.; Abdurahman et al., 2024; Alvero et al., 2024). Perspective diversity is usually measured with multiple-choice survey responses (Durmus et al., 2023) or free-text responses partitioned into different classes (Zhang et al., 2025). In our work we measure the epistemic diversity of models by partitioning the LLM output space into clusters of claims. This allows us to avoid shallow and/or fuzzy features such as semantic and lexical similarity, and improves upon unreliable multiple-choice setups (Röttger et al., 2024). Knowledge Collapse LLMs can exacerbate their own biases, leading to model collapse (Shumailov et al., 2024). growing concern among scholars is that such homogenization, combined with increased adoption of LLMs, will lead to epistemic problems at societal level (Zheng and Lee, 2023; Mess"

Self-evolving LLM agents can abandon alignment constraints post-deployment, leading to rapid misalignment and collective failure in multi-agent systems.  					AI-generated summary 				 As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly gain self-evolutionary capabilities to adapt and refine their strategies through real-world interaction, their long-term reliability becomes a critical concern. We identify the Alignment Tipping Process (ATP), a critical post-deployment risk unique to self-evolving LLM agents. Unlike training-time failures, ATP arises when continual interaction drives agents to abandon alignment constraints established during training in favor of reinforced, self-interested strategies. We formalize and analyze ATP through two complementary paradigms: Self-Interested Exploration, where repeated high-reward deviations induce individual behavioral drift, and Imitative Strategy Diffusion, where deviant behaviors spread across multi-agent systems. Building on these paradigms, we construct controllable testbeds and benchmark Qwen3-8B and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Our experiments show that alignment benefits erode rapidly under self-evolution, with initially aligned models converging toward unaligned states. In multi-agent settings, successful violations diffuse quickly, leading to collective misalignment. Moreover, current reinforcement learning-based alignment methods provide only fragile defenses against alignment tipping. Together, these findings demonstrate that alignment of LLM agents is not a static property but a fragile and dynamic one, vulnerable to feedback-driven decay during deployment.

SRGen, a lightweight test-time framework, improves LLM reasoning by dynamically identifying and correcting high-uncertainty tokens during generation, leading to better single-pass quality and self-consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training, both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g., SLOT) techniques.

"SRGen, a lightweight test-time framework, improves LLM reasoning by dynamically identifying and correcting high-uncertainty tokens during generation, leading to better single-pass quality and self-consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training, both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g., SLOT) techniques."

A study measures epistemic diversity in LLM outputs, showing that newer models are more diverse but still less so than web searches, and that RAG improves diversity with cultural context variations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate lexically, semantically, and stylistically homogenous texts. This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in epistemic representation
