Text:"BookWorld: From Novels to Interactive Agent Societies for Creative Story Generation Yiting Ran*1, Xintao Wang*1, Tian Qiu1, Jiaqing Liang1, Yanghua Xiao1 and Deqing Yang1 *Equal contributions, 1Fudan University Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled social simulation through multiagent systems. Prior efforts focus on agent societies created from scratch, assigning agents with newly defined personas. However, simulating established fictional worlds and characters remain largely underexplored, despite its significant practical value. In this paper, we introduce BookWorld, comprehensive system for constructing and simulating book-based multi-agent societies. BookWorlds design covers comprehensive real-world intricacies, including diverse and dynamic characters, fictional worldviews, geographical constraints and changes, e.t.c.. BookWorld enables diverse applications including story generation, interactive games and social simulation, offering novel ways to extend and explore beloved fictional works. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BookWorld generates creative, high-quality stories while maintaining fidelity to the source books, surpassing previous methods with win rate of 75.36%. The code of this paper can be found at the project page: https://bookworld2025.github.io/ Figure 1: preview of BookWorld. Characters in the same location can interact with each other based on their goals and other factors. The map is represented as discrete graph, where characters can traverse between adjacent locations spending several turns. 1. Introduction Now we know that we are living our lives in book. If what you say is true, Im going to run away from the book and go my own way. Sophies World, by Jostein Gaarder. Characters in fictional works, once established, should take on life of their own, beyond the manipulation of their authors.

How can world models benefit LLM agents? The gap between the prior knowledge of LLMs and the specified environments dynamics usually bottlenecks LLMs performance as world models. To bridge the gap, we propose training-free world alignment that learns an environments symbolic knowledge complementary to LLMs. The sym1Australian AI Institute, Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology Sydney, Australia 2Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, USA 3Tencent, China. Correspondence to: Siyu Zhou <Siyu.Zhou2@student.uts.edu.au>, Tianyi Zhou <zhou@umiacs.umd.edu>. Preliminary work. 1 bolic knowledge covers action rules, knowledge graphs, and scene graphs, which are extracted by LLMs from exploration trajectories and encoded into executable codes to regulate LLM agents policies. We further propose an RL-free, model-based agent WALL-E 2.0 through the model-predictive control (MPC) framework. Unlike classical MPC requiring costly optimization on the fly, we adopt an LLM agent as an efficient look-ahead optimizer of future steps actions by interacting with the neurosymbolic world model. While the LLM agents strong heuristics make it an efficient planner in MPC, the quality of its planned actions is also secured by the accurate predictions of the aligned world model. They together considerably improve learning efficiency in new environment. On WALL-E 2.0: World Alignment by NeuroSymbolic Learning open-world challenges in Mars (Minecraft like) and ALFWorld (embodied indoor environments), WALL-E 2.0 significantly outperforms existing methods, e.g., surpassing baselines in Mars by 16.1%51.6% of success rate and by at least 61.7% in score. In ALFWorld, it achieves new record 98% success rate after only 4 iterations. 1. Introduction Figure 2. Overview of WALL-E 2.0. The agent determines actions to take via MPC, which optimizes future steps actions by interacting with neurosymbolic world model. The world model adopts an LLM whose predictions are aligned with environment dynamics through code rules converted from symbolic knowledge (action rules, knowledge/scene graph) learned via inductive reasoning from real trajectories and predicted trajectories. While large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to complex reasoning, generation, and planning tasks, they are not sufficiently reliable to be deployed as an agent in specific open-world environments, e.g., games, VR/AR systems, medical care, education, autonomous driving, etc (OpenAI, 2023; Wei et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2024). primary reason for the failures is the gap between the prior knowledge driven commonsense reasoning by LLMs and the specified environments dynamics. The gap leads to incorrect predictions of future states, hallucinations, or violation of basic laws in LLM agents decision-making process (Mu et al., 2023b; Yang et al., 2024; Das et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2024). Although the alignment of LLMs with 2 human preferences has been widely studied as major objective of LLM post-training, world alignment with an environments dynamics has not been adequately investigated for LLM agents (Hao et al., 2023; Rafailov et al., 2024; Ge et al., 2024). Moreover, many existing LLM agents are model-free: they directly generate and execute actions in real environments without being verified or optimized within world model or simulator (Mu et al., 2023b; Yao et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2024; Zitkovich et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023; Micheli & Fleuret, 2021; Brohan et al., 2022) in advance. This leads to safety risks and suboptimality of planned trajectories. In this paper, we show that the world alignment of an LLM can significantly improve the LLM performance as promising world model, which enables us to build more powerful embodied LLM agents in partially observable settings. Instead of finetuning the LLM, we introduce training-free pipeline World Alignment by NeuroSymbolic Learning (WALL-E 2.0) to learn symbolic knowledge that is environment-specific and complementary to the LLMs prior knowledge, by analyzing explored trajectories and predicted ones as shown in Figure 2. WALL-E 2.0s symbolic knowledge covers action rules, knowledge graphs, and scene graphs, which can be converted into executable code rules to turn pretrained LLM into an accurate neurosymbolic world model (via function calling). It combines the strengths of both LLMs and symbolic representations in modeling environment dynamics, i.e., (1) the rich prior knowledge, probabilistic, and deductive reasoning capability of LLMs under uncertainty (Hu & Shu, 2023); and (2) the formal constraints, deterministic transition rules, and environment-specific structures enforced or encoded by symbolic knowledge. In our studies, LLMs already cover the most common knowledge of dynamics but few additional symbolic knowledge can significantly improve the world model predictions generated by LLMs. Different types of symbolic knowledge play important roles in building more reliable and adaptive model-based LLM agents, especially in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The action rules capture and enforce deterministic constraints in the decision-making process; the knowledge graph represents feasibility constraints and action prerequisites; while the scene graph provides global information complementing the partial observations of agents. In WALL-E 2.0, we leverage LLMs inductive reasoning capabilities to abstract concise symbolic knowledge from explored trajectories for episodes. We further develop maximum co"

[23.04.2025 04:14] Abstract 11. Recent video large language models (Video LLMs) often depend on costly human annotations or proprietary model APIs (e.g., GPT-4o) to produce training data, which limits their training at scale. In this paper, we explore large-scale training for Video LLM with cheap automatic speech recognition (ASR)...

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled social simulation through multi-agent systems. Prior efforts focus on agent societies created from scratch, assigning agents with newly defined personas. However, simulating established fictional worlds and characters remain largely underexplored, despite its significant practical value. In this paper, we introduce BookWorld, a comprehensive system for constructing and simulating book-based multi-agent societies. BookWorld's design covers comprehensive real-world intricacies, including diverse and dynamic characters, fictional worldviews, geographical constraints and changes, e.t.c. BookWorld enables diverse applications including story generation, interactive games and social simulation, offering novel ways to extend and explore beloved fictional works. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BookWorld generates creative, high-quality stories while maintaining fidelity to the source books, surpassing previous methods with a win rate of 75.36%. The code of this paper can be found at the project page: https://bookworld2025.github.io/.
