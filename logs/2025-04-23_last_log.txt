Text:"DIFFVOX: DIFFERENTIABLE MODEL FOR CAPTURING AND ANALYSING PROFESSIONAL EFFECTS DISTRIBUTIONS Chin-Yun Yu , Marco A. Martínez-Ramírez, Junghyun Koo, Ben Hayes, Wei-Hsiang Liao, György Fazekas, and Yuki Mitsufuji Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK Sony AI, Tokyo, Japan Sony Group Corporation, Tokyo, Japan chin-yun.yu@qmul.ac.uk 5 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 5 3 7 4 1 . 4 0 5 2 : r ABSTRACT This study introduces novel and interpretable model, DiffVox, for matching vocal effects in music production. DiffVox, short for Differentiable Vocal Fx", integrates parametric equalisation, dynamic range control, delay, and reverb with efficient differentiable implementations to enable gradient-based optimisation for parameter estimation. Vocal presets are retrieved from two datasets, comprising 70 tracks from MedleyDB and 365 tracks from private collection. Analysis of parameter correlations highlights strong relationships between effects and parameters, such as the highpass and low-shelf filters often behaving together to shape the low end, and the delay time correlates with the intensity of the delayed signals. Principal component analysis reveals connections to McAdams timbre dimensions, where the most crucial component modulates the perceived spaciousness while the secondary components influence spectral brightness. Statistical testing confirms the non-Gaussian nature of the parameter distribution, highlighting the complexity of the vocal effects space. These initial findings on the parameter distributions set the foundation for future research in vocal effects modelling and automatic mixing. 1. INTRODUCTION Audio effects are essential in music production. They enable audio engineers to shape sounds timbre and spatial characteristics, such as stereo width. Understanding how these effects (their settings) are used in real-world audio is valuable for developing automatic audio processing tools to make realistic music mixes. Yet, this knowledge is based o"

This study introduces a novel and interpretable model, DiffVox, for matching vocal effects in music production. DiffVox, short for ``Differentiable Vocal Fx", integrates parametric equalisation, dynamic range control, delay, and reverb with efficient differentiable implementations to enable gradient-based optimisation for parameter estimation. Vocal presets are retrieved from two datasets, comprising 70 tracks from MedleyDB and 365 tracks from a private collection. Analysis of parameter correlations highlights strong relationships between effects and parameters, such as the high-pass and low-shelf filters often behaving together to shape the low end, and the delay time correlates with the intensity of the delayed signals. Principal component analysis reveals connections to McAdams' timbre dimensions, where the most crucial component modulates the perceived spaciousness while the secondary components influence spectral brightness. Statistical testing confirms the non-Gaussian nature of the parameter distribution, highlighting the complexity of the vocal effects space. These initial findings on the parameter distributions set the foundation for future research in vocal effects modelling and automatic mixing. Our source code and datasets are accessible at https://github.com/SonyResearch/diffvox.
