Text:"CAPTURE: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Occluded Object CountingElias Stengel-Eskin{atin, esteng, jmincho, mbansal}@cs.unc.edu 5 2 0 2 1 2 ] . [ 1 5 8 4 5 1 . 4 0 5 2 : r aRecognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURE), which requires model to count objects arranged in pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURE requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURE also tests VLMs ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURE consists of two parts: (1) CAPTUREreal, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTUREsynthetic, controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2VL) on CAPTURE, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURE. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty counting in images.1 1. Introduction Inferring what lies behind different objects in occluded scenes is crucial for human perception, as it allows us to 1Code and data: https://github.com/atinpothiraj/CAPTURe Figure 1. CAPTURE example with an output from GPT4-o. While people can easily infer the missing number of cups and correctly reason over occluded patterns, models generally struggle to reason over these occluded scenes. maintain coherent understanding of our environment even when parts are hidden. The human visual system accomplishes this by integrating past experiences, context, and sensory inputs to reconstruct incomplete scenes [19, 27, 30, 44]. Meanwhile, recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) especially in terms of visual and spatial reasoning raise the question of whether these systems can perform similar inferential tasks. One way of measuring such capabilities is through amodal completion the task of inferring the invisible parts of partially occluded objects; here, vision-only models are typically evaluated via dense prediction tasks like object segmentation and image inpainting [5]. However, this format is not well-suited for assessing VLMs, whose outputs consist of text tokens rather than pixel-level predictions. This raises critical question: how can we quantify the ability of VLMs to form spatial world modeling [17] in the presence of occlusion. To address this, we introduce CAPTURE, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions, novel benchmark that tests VLMs world modeling and spatial reasoning abilities through the task of amodal count1 ing, where models are prompted to count occluded objects by amodally completing pattern. CAPTURE focuses on counting as it provides an objective and easy-to-verify output by comparing predicted counts with ground truth values. Moreover, patterned objects appear in variety of realworld domains, especially in man-made environments like parking lots, cities, and warehouses, where counting objects is often required. Fig. 1 illustrates the CAPTURE task. We show VLM an image where objects are placed in regular pattern (e.g., 4x4 grid) with some objects occluded, and ask the model to count the total number of objects in the image assuming that the pattern continues behind the occlusion. The task requires handling occlusion, pattern recognition, and counting skills that exist in humans from fairly young age [27, 30, 44], thus humans can easily answer such questions indeed, we find that people can complete CAPTURE tasks with almost no error. CAPTURE consists of two subsets: CAPTUREreal and CAPTUREsynthetic. As shown in Fig. 2, CAPTUREreal contains real-world images and tests the ability of models to perform amodal counting in naturalistic contexts, while CAPTUREsynthetic allows us to analyze specific factors by controlling different variables like color, shape, and number of objects. All images in CAPTURE contain pattern of objects and manually annotated occluding black box covering some objects. CAPTUREreal contains 924 images with diverse range of settings and objects, covering 92 different object types, while CAPTUREsyntheticcontains 1250 images across multiple attribute classes. By combining vision encoders with large language models (LLMs), VLMs have the potential to reason in zeroshot way about visual inputs. To put this ability to the test and measure VLMs ability to reason about missing visual information, we evaluate four strong recent VLMs (GPT4o, InternVL2, Molmo, and Qwen2VL) on CAPTURE. Our experiment results (Sec. 4) show that models generally struggle with the multiple aspects of task, with high error rates on both CAPTUREreal and CAPTUREsynthetic for occluded and unoccluded images. In contrast, we find that humans can perform the task easily: whereas model performance deteriorates as more objects in images are occluded, humans complete the task almost perfectly. We also compare VLMs to vision-only model trained to count visible objects; while this model generally outperforms VLMs, its error is directly tied to the number of occluded objects the more objects are occluded, the higher its error will be. By objectively measuring VLMs spatial reasoning capabilities under occlusion, CAPTURE highlights an unexpected weakness in VLMs. We analyze this weakness by providing the model with additional clues and information. Specifically, we test to what degree the VLMs failure stems from an inability to integrate visual information by providing it with text-based representation of the"

Personalized image synthesis has emerged as a pivotal application in text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of images featuring specific subjects in diverse contexts. While diffusion models have dominated this domain, auto-regressive models, with their unified architecture for text and image modeling, remain underexplored for personalized image generation. This paper investigates the potential of optimizing auto-regressive models for personalized image synthesis, leveraging their inherent multimodal capabilities to perform this task. We propose a two-stage training strategy that combines optimization of text embeddings and fine-tuning of transformer layers. Our experiments on the auto-regressive model demonstrate that this method achieves comparable subject fidelity and prompt following to the leading diffusion-based personalization methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of auto-regressive models in personalized image generation, offering a new direction for future research in this area.

Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty counting in images.
