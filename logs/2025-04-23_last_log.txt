[ 1 6 6 2 5 1 . 4 0 5 2 : r aWe design suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are loose abstraction of open-ended realworld tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the presentday language model. Much like real-world tasks that require creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how nexttoken learning is myopic and memorizes excessively; comparatively, multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, in our tasks, we find that to elicit randomness from the Transformer without hurting coherence, it is better to inject noise right at the input layer (via method we dub hashconditioning) rather than defer to temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and softmax-based sampling. We make part of the code available under https://github.com/ chenwu98/algorithmic-creativity 1. INTRODUCTION Not all forms of intelligence are solely about being correct In open-ended tasks, what also matters is or wrong. finding creative ways to satisfy request, making surprising *Equal contribution 1Google Research, US 2Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, US.

For instance, consider responding to highly under-specified prompts Generate challenging high-school word like problem involving the Pythagoras Theorem. or Suggest some candidate therapeutic antibodies targeting the HER2 antigen. or Provide vivid analogy to differentiate quantum and classical mechanics. Creativity in such tasks requires generating responses that are not just correct or coherent, but are also diverse across responses and are original compared to the training data. These currentlysidelined desiderata will rise to prominence as we explore LLMs for open-ended scientific discovery (Gruver et al., 2023; Romera-Paredes et al., 2024; Si et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024a), for generating novel training data (Yu et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024c; Wang et al., 2023), and as we scale up test-time compute approaches that benefit from diversity in exploration, such as best-of-N (Cobbe et al., 2021; Chow et al., 2024; Dang et al., 2025) and long chain-of-thought reasoning (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI, 2025; Snell et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024). Unlike simple open-ended tasks like generating names and basic sentences (Zhang et al., 2024b; Hopkins et al., 2023), many creative tasks (like designing clever Olympiad problem) are said to involve random flash of creative insight termed variously as leap of thought (Wang et al., 2024a; Talmor et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2024), eureka moment (Bubeck et al., 2023), mental leap (Holyoak & Thagard, 1995; Callaway, 2013; Hofstadter, 1995) or an incubation step (Varshney et al., 2019). The thesis of this paper is that learning to solve such creative leap-of-thought tasks (defined shortly) is misaligned with the current language modeling paradigm (a) in terms of next-token learning, and (b) in how randomness is elicited. We articulate these two concerns by designing suite of algorithmic tasks inspired by such creative tasks. We then demonstrate how the creativity of language models suffers in these tasks, and how this can be alleviated (to an extent, within our tasks). Concretely, for the scope of this paper, creative leap-ofthought task refers to tasks that involve search-and-plan process; crucially, this process orchestrates multiple random decisions in advance before generating the output. Typically, GOING BEYOND THE CREATIVE LIMITS OF NEXT-TOKEN PREDICTION such leap of thought is highly implicit in the text to infer it, one has to deeply engage with the text and detect higher-order patterns in it. We think of tasks like designing satisfying math problem, generating worthwhile research ideas, or drawing surprising analogies as examples of such tasks. Ideally, one would directly study these real-world tasks to quantify the limits of language models. Indeed, flurry of recent works report that LLM-generated research ideas tend to be rephrased from existing ideas (Gupta & Pruthi, 2025; Beel et al., 2025) and that LLM outputs tend to be less creative than humans e.g., Chakrabarty et al. (2024); Lu et al. (2024b) (See J). While assessing real-world tasks is lofty goal, the evaluations are subjective (Wang et al., 2024b; Runco & Jaeger, 2012), and when the model has been exposed to all of the internet, originality is hard to ascertain. Thus, the conclusions will inevitably invite debate (such as Si et al. (2024) vs. Gupta & Pruthi (2025) or Lu et al. (2024a) vs. Beel et al. (2025)). In search of more definitive conclusions, we approach from different angle: we study minimal and controllable tasks that are loose abstractions of real-world tasks and yet allow one to rigorously quantify originality and diversity. This follows along the lines of recent works that have studied the diversity of models in graph path-finding (Khona et al., 2024) and generating challenging CFGs (Allen-Zhu & Li, 2023b). Broadly, we refer to such tasks as open-ended algorithmic tasks. Our aim is to design tasks more minimal than these prior tasks, and crucially, tease apart distinct computational skills required for creativity. This will allow us to systematically investigate issues in the current paradigm of model training and propose alternatives. As our first main contribution, we draw inspiration from cognitive science literature (Boden, 2003) (see also Franceschelli & Musolesi (2023)) to design algorithmic tasks isolating two distinct types of creative leaps of thought. The first class of tasks involves combinational creativity: drawing novel connections in knowledge, like in research, wordplay or drawing analogies (se"

We design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are a loose abstraction of open-ended real-world tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic and memorizes excessively; comparatively, multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, in our tasks, we find that to elicit randomness from the Transformer without hurting coherence, it is better to inject noise right at the input layer (via a method we dub hash-conditioning) rather than defer to temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and softmax-based sampling. We make part of the code available under https://github.com/chenwu98/algorithmic-creativity

"We design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are a loose abstraction of open-ended real-world tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic and memorizes excessively; comparatively, multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, in our tasks, we find that to elicit randomness from the Transformer without hurting coherence, it is better to inject noise right at the input layer (via a method we dub hash-conditioning) rather than defer to temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and softmax-based sampling. We make part of the code available under https://github.com/chenwu98/algorithmic-creativity"
