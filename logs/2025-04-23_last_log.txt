Text:"2025-4-23 LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities Thomas Schmied1,+, J√∂rg Bornschein2, Jordi Grau-Moya2, Markus Wulfmeier2 and Razvan Pascanu2 1ELLIS Unit, LIT AI Lab, Institute for Machine Learning, JKU Linz, Austria, 2Google DeepMind, +Work done at Google DeepMind The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in various agentic applications. key hypothesis is that LLMs, leveraging common sense and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, can effectively explore and efficiently solve complex domains. However, LLM agents have been found to suffer from sub-optimal exploration and the knowing-doing gap, the inability to effectively act on knowledge present in the model. In this work, we systematically study why LLMs perform sub-optimally in decision-making scenarios. In particular, we closely examine three prevalent failure modes: greediness, frequency bias, and the knowing-doing gap. We propose mitigation of these shortcomings by fine-tuning via Reinforcement Learning (RL) on self-generated CoT rationales. Our experiments across multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and Tic-tac-toe, demonstrate that RL fine-tuning enhances the decisionmaking abilities of LLMs by increasing exploration and narrowing the knowing-doing gap. Finally, we study both classic exploration mechanisms, such as ùúñ-greedy, and LLM-specific approaches, such as self-correction and self-consistency, to enable more effective fine-tuning of LLMs for decision-making. 1. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on massive internet-scale datasets have demonstrated success across diverse domains, including text generation and language understanding (Brown et al., 2020b; Dubey et al., 2024; Radford et al., 2019; Team et al., 2023b, 2024a). Their broad pre-training distribution, enables generalization to wide range of scenarios including coding assistance (Li et al., 2022), education (Team et al., 2024d), and medicine (Saab et al., 2024).

The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in various agentic applications. A key hypothesis is that LLMs, leveraging common sense and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, can effectively explore and efficiently solve complex domains. However, LLM agents have been found to suffer from sub-optimal exploration and the knowing-doing gap, the inability to effectively act on knowledge present in the model. In this work, we systematically study why LLMs perform sub-optimally in decision-making scenarios. In particular, we closely examine three prevalent failure modes: greediness, frequency bias, and the knowing-doing gap. We propose mitigation of these shortcomings by fine-tuning via Reinforcement Learning (RL) on self-generated CoT rationales. Our experiments across multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and Tic-tac-toe, demonstrate that RL fine-tuning enhances the decision-making abilities of LLMs by increasing exploration and narrowing the knowing-doing gap. Finally, we study both classic exploration mechanisms, such as epsilon-greedy, and LLM-specific approaches, such as self-correction and self-consistency, to enable more effective fine-tuning of LLMs for decision-making.
