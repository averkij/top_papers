Text:"2025-4-23 The Bitter Lesson Learned from 2,000+ Multilingual Benchmarks Minghao Wu1,2, Weixuan Wang3, Sinuo Liu1,3, Huifeng Yin1,4, Xintong Wang1,5, Yu Zhao1, Chenyang Lyu1, Longyue Wang1, Weihua Luo1, Kaifu Zhang1 1 Alibaba International Digital Commerce 2 Monash University 3 The University of Edinburgh 4 Tsinghua University 5 Universität Hamburg As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in linguistic capabilities, robust multilingual evaluation has become essential for promoting equitable technological progress. This position paper examines over 2,000 multilingual (non-English) benchmarks from 148 countries, published between 2021 and 2024, to evaluate past, present, and future practices in multilingual benchmarking. Our findings reveal that, despite significant investments amounting to tens of millions of dollars, English remains significantly overrepresented in these benchmarks. Additionally, most benchmarks rely on original language content rather than translations, with the majority sourced from high-resource countries such as China, India, Germany, the UK, and the USA. Furthermore, comparison of benchmark performance with human judgments highlights notable disparities. STEM-related tasks exhibit strong correlations with human evaluations (0.70 to 0.85), while traditional NLP tasks like question answering (e.g., XQuAD) show much weaker correlations (0.11 to 0.30). Moreover, translating English benchmarks into other languages proves insufficient, as localized benchmarks demonstrate significantly higher alignment with local human judgments (0.68) than their translated counterparts (0.47). This underscores the importance of creating culturally and linguistically tailored benchmarks rather than relying solely on translations. Through this comprehensive analysis, we highlight six key limitations in current multilingual evaluation practices, propose the guiding principles accordingly for effective multilingual benchmarking, and outline five critical resear"

Text:"5 2 0 2 6 1 ] . [ 1 3 0 7 1 1 . 4 0 5 2 : r Progent: Programmable Privilege Control for LLM Agents Tianneng Shi1, Jingxuan He1, Zhun Wang1, Linyu Wu1, Hongwei Li2, Wenbo Guo2, Dawn Song1 1UC Berkeley 2 UC Santa Barbara Abstract LLM agents are an emerging form of AI systems where large language models (LLMs) serve as the central component, utilizing diverse set of tools to complete user-assigned tasks. Despite their great potential, LLM agents pose significant security risks. When interacting with the external world, they may encounter malicious commands from attackers, leading to the execution of dangerous actions such as unauthorized financial transactions. promising way to improve agent security is by allowing only actions essential for task completion while blocking unnecessary ones, namely enforcing the principle of least privilege. However, achieving this is challenging, as it requires capturing the diverse scenarios in which agents operate and maintaining both security and utility. In this work, we introduce Progent, the first privilege control mechanism for LLM agents. The heart of Progent is domainspecific language for flexibly expressing privilege control policies applied during agent execution. These policies provide fine-grained constraints over tool calls, deciding when tool calls are permissible and specifying fallbacks if they are not. This enables agent developers and users to craft suitable policies for their specific use cases and enforce them deterministically to guarantee security. Thanks to its modular design, integrating Progent does not alter agent internals and requires only minimal changes to agent implementation, enhancing its practicality and potential for widespread adoption. To automate policy writing, we leverage state-of-the-art LLMs to generate Progents policies based on user queries, which are then updated dynamically for improved security and utility. Our extensive evaluation shows that Progent enables strong security (e.g., reducing"

Corresponding author. zhoujingkai.zjk@alibaba-inc.com, kugang.cwh@alibaba-inc.com Controllable character animation remains challenging problem, particularly in handling rare poses, stylized characters, character-object interactions, complex illumination, and dynamic scenes. To tackle these issues, prior work has largely focused on injecting pose and appearance guidance via elaborate bypass networks, but often struggles to generalize to open-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose new perspective that, as long as the foundation model is powerful enough, straightforward model modifications with flexible fine-tuning strategies can largely address the above challenges, taking step towards controllable character animation in the wild. Specifically, we introduce RealisDance-DiT, built upon the Wan-2.1 video foundation model. Our sufficient analysis reveals that the widely adopted Reference Net design is suboptimal for large-scale DiT models. Instead, we demonstrate that minimal modifications to the foundation model architecture yield surprisingly strong baseline. We further propose the low-noise warmup and large batches and small iterations strategies to accelerate model convergence during fine-tuning while maximally preserving the priors of the foundation model. In addition, we introduce new test dataset that captures diverse real-world challenges, complementing existing benchmarks such as TikTok dataset and UBC fashion video dataset, to comprehensively evaluate the proposed method. Extensive experiments show that RealisDance-DiT outperforms existing methods by large margin."

Generating detailed and accurate descriptions for specific regions in images and videos remains a fundamental challenge for vision-language models. We introduce the Describe Anything Model (DAM), a model designed for detailed localized captioning (DLC). DAM preserves both local details and global context through two key innovations: a focal prompt, which ensures high-resolution encoding of targeted regions, and a localized vision backbone, which integrates precise localization with its broader context. To tackle the scarcity of high-quality DLC data, we propose a Semi-supervised learning (SSL)-based Data Pipeline (DLC-SDP). DLC-SDP starts with existing segmentation datasets and expands to unlabeled web images using SSL. We introduce DLC-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate DLC without relying on reference captions. DAM sets new state-of-the-art on 7 benchmarks spanning keyword-level, phrase-level, and detailed multi-sentence localized image and video captioning.

"Generating detailed and accurate descriptions for specific regions in images and videos remains a fundamental challenge for vision-language models. We introduce the Describe Anything Model (DAM), a model designed for detailed localized captioning (DLC). DAM preserves both local details and global context through two key innovations: a focal prompt, which ensures high-resolution encoding of targeted regions, and a localized vision backbone, which integrates precise localization with its broader context. To tackle the scarcity of high-quality DLC data, we propose a Semi-supervised learning (SSL)-based Data Pipeline (DLC-SDP). DLC-SDP starts with existing segmentation datasets and expands to unlabeled web images using SSL. We introduce DLC-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate DLC without relying on reference captions. DAM sets new state-of-the-art on 7 benchmarks spanning keyword-level, phrase-level, and detailed multi-sentence localized image and video captioning."

As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in linguistic capabilities, robust multilingual evaluation has become essential for promoting equitable technological progress. This position paper examines over 2,000 multilingual (non-English) benchmarks from 148 countries, published between 2021 and 2024, to evaluate past, present, and future practices in multilingual benchmarking. Our findings reveal that, despite significant investments amounting to tens of millions of dollars, English remains significantly overrepresented in these benchmarks. Additionally, most benchmarks rely on original language content rather than translations, with the majority sourced from high-resource countries such as China, India, Germany, the UK, and the USA. Furthermore, a comparison of benchmark performance with human judgments highlights notable disparities. STEM-related tasks exhibit strong correlations with human evaluations (0.70 to 0.85), while traditional NLP tasks like question answering (e.g., XQuAD) show much weaker correlations (0.11 to 0.30). Moreover, translating English benchmarks into other languages proves insufficient, as localized benchmarks demonstrate significantly higher alignment with local human judgments (0.68) than their translated counterparts (0.47). This underscores the importance of creating culturally and linguistically tailored benchmarks rather than relying solely on translations. Through this comprehensive analysis, we highlight six key limitations in current multilingual evaluation practices, propose the guiding principles accordingly for effective multilingual benchmarking, and outline five critical research directions to drive progress in the field. Finally, we call for a global collaborative effort to develop human-aligned benchmarks that prioritize real-world applications.

Scaling inference-time computation has substantially improved the reasoning capabilities of language models. However, existing methods have significant limitations: serialized chain-of-thought approaches generate overly long outputs, leading to increased latency and exhausted context windows, while parallel methods such as self-consistency suffer from insufficient coordination, resulting in redundant computations and limited performance gains. To address these shortcomings, we propose Adaptive Parallel Reasoning (APR), a novel reasoning framework that enables language models to orchestrate both serialized and parallel computations end-to-end. APR generalizes existing reasoning methods by enabling adaptive multi-threaded inference using spawn() and join() operations. A key innovation is our end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, optimizing both parent and child inference threads to enhance task success rate without requiring predefined reasoning structures. Experiments on the Countdown reasoning task demonstrate significant benefits of APR: (1) higher performance within the same context window (83.4% vs. 60.0% at 4k context); (2) superior scalability with increased computation (80.1% vs. 66.6% at 20k total tokens); (3) improved accuracy at equivalent latency (75.2% vs. 57.3% at approximately 5,000ms). APR represents a step towards enabling language models to autonomously optimize their reasoning processes through adaptive allocation of computation.

Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the effectiveness of length scaling during post-training, yet its potential in pre-training remains underexplored. We present the Parallel Hidden Decoding Transformer (PHD-Transformer), a novel framework that enables efficient length scaling during pre-training while maintaining inference efficiency. PHD-Transformer achieves this through an innovative KV cache management strategy that distinguishes between original tokens and hidden decoding tokens. By retaining only the KV cache of original tokens for long-range dependencies while immediately discarding hidden decoding tokens after use, our approach maintains the same KV cache size as the vanilla transformer while enabling effective length scaling. To further enhance performance, we introduce two optimized variants: PHD-SWA employs sliding window attention to preserve local dependencies, while PHD-CSWA implements chunk-wise sliding window attention to eliminate linear growth in pre-filling time. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks.

"Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the effectiveness of length scaling during post-training, yet its potential in pre-training remains underexplored. We present the Parallel Hidden Decoding Transformer (PHD-Transformer), a novel framework that enables efficient length scaling during pre-training while maintaining inference efficiency. PHD-Transformer achieves this through an innovative KV cache management strategy that distinguishes between original tokens and hidden decoding tokens. By retaining only the KV cache of original tokens for long-range dependencies while immediately discarding hidden decoding tokens after use, our approach maintains the same KV cache size as the vanilla transformer while enabling effective length scaling. To further enhance performance, we introduce two optimized variants: PHD-SWA employs sliding window attention to preserve local dependencies, while PHD-CSWA implements chunk-wise sliding window attention to eliminate linear growth in pre-filling time. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks."

Humans naturally share information with those they are connected to, and video has become one of the dominant mediums for communication and expression on the Internet. To support the creation of high-quality large-scale video content, a modern pipeline requires a comprehensive understanding of both the raw input materials (e.g., the unedited footage captured by cameras) and the editing components (e.g., visual effects). In video editing scenarios, models must process multiple modalities (e.g., vision, audio, text) with strong background knowledge and handle flexible input lengths (e.g., hour-long raw videos), which poses significant challenges for traditional models. In this report, we introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a wide range of video understand editing scenarios. The first release focuses on temporal retrieval, i.e., identifying the time ranges within the input videos corresponding to a given text query, which plays a critical role in intelligent editing. The model is capable of processing hour-long videos with strong temporal understanding capability, e.g., retrieve time ranges for certain queries. To support a comprehensive evaluation in real-world scenarios, we also present the VUE-TR benchmark, which introduces five key advancements. 1) Video duration: significantly longer than existing temporal retrival datasets, 2) Audio support: includes audio-based queries, 3) Query format: diverse query lengths/formats, 4) Annotation quality: ground-truth time ranges are manually annotated. 5) Evaluation metric: a refined IoU metric to support evaluation over multiple time ranges. Remarkably, Vidi significantly outperforms leading proprietary models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini, on the temporal retrieval task, indicating its superiority in video editing scenarios.

Recent text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive visual quality through extensive scaling of training data and model parameters, yet they often struggle with complex scenes and fine-grained details. Inspired by the self-reflection capabilities emergent in large language models, we propose ReflectionFlow, an inference-time framework enabling diffusion models to iteratively reflect upon and refine their outputs. ReflectionFlow introduces three complementary inference-time scaling axes: (1) noise-level scaling to optimize latent initialization; (2) prompt-level scaling for precise semantic guidance; and most notably, (3) reflection-level scaling, which explicitly provides actionable reflections to iteratively assess and correct previous generations. To facilitate reflection-level scaling, we construct GenRef, a large-scale dataset comprising 1 million triplets, each containing a reflection, a flawed image, and an enhanced image. Leveraging this dataset, we efficiently perform reflection tuning on state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, FLUX.1-dev, by jointly modeling multimodal inputs within a unified framework. Experimental results show that ReflectionFlow significantly outperforms naive noise-level scaling methods, offering a scalable and compute-efficient solution toward higher-quality image synthesis on challenging tasks.

LLM agents are an emerging form of AI systems where large language models (LLMs) serve as the central component, utilizing a diverse set of tools to complete user-assigned tasks. Despite their great potential, LLM agents pose significant security risks. When interacting with the external world, they may encounter malicious commands from attackers, leading to the execution of dangerous actions. A promising way to address this is by enforcing the principle of least privilege: allowing only essential actions for task completion while blocking unnecessary ones. However, achieving this is challenging, as it requires covering diverse agent scenarios while preserving both security and utility.   We introduce Progent, the first privilege control mechanism for LLM agents. At its core is a domain-specific language for flexibly expressing privilege control policies applied during agent execution. These policies provide fine-grained constraints over tool calls, deciding when tool calls are permissible and specifying fallbacks if they are not. This enables agent developers and users to craft suitable policies for their specific use cases and enforce them deterministically to guarantee security. Thanks to its modular design, integrating Progent does not alter agent internals and requires only minimal changes to agent implementation, enhancing its practicality and potential for widespread adoption. To automate policy writing, we leverage LLMs to generate policies based on user queries, which are then updated dynamically for improved security and utility. Our extensive evaluation shows that it enables strong security while preserving high utility across three distinct scenarios or benchmarks: AgentDojo, ASB, and AgentPoison. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth analysis, showcasing the effectiveness of its core components and the resilience of its automated policy generation against adaptive attacks.

"LLM agents are an emerging form of AI systems where large language models (LLMs) serve as the central component, utilizing a diverse set of tools to complete user-assigned tasks.

We propose MR. Video, an agentic long video understanding framework that demonstrates the simple yet effective MapReduce principle for processing long videos: (1) Map: independently and densely perceiving short video clips, and (2) Reduce: jointly aggregating information from all clips. Compared with sequence-to-sequence vision-language models (VLMs), MR. Video performs detailed short video perception without being limited by context length. Compared with existing video agents that typically rely on sequential key segment selection, the Map operation enables simpler and more scalable sequence parallel perception of short video segments. Its Reduce step allows for more comprehensive context aggregation and reasoning, surpassing explicit key segment retrieval. This MapReduce principle is applicable to both VLMs and video agents, and we use LLM agents to validate its effectiveness.   In practice, MR. Video employs two MapReduce stages: (A) Captioning: generating captions for short video clips (map), then standardizing repeated characters and objects into shared names (reduce); (B) Analysis: for each user question, analyzing relevant information from individual short videos (map), and integrating them into a final answer (reduce). MR. Video achieves over 10% accuracy improvement on the challenging LVBench compared to state-of-the-art VLMs and video agents.   Code is available at: https://github.com/ziqipang/MR-Video

Controllable character animation remains a challenging problem, particularly in handling rare poses, stylized characters, character-object interactions, complex illumination, and dynamic scenes. To tackle these issues, prior work has largely focused on injecting pose and appearance guidance via elaborate bypass networks, but often struggles to generalize to open-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new perspective that, as long as the foundation model is powerful enough, straightforward model modifications with flexible fine-tuning strategies can largely address the above challenges, taking a step towards controllable character animation in the wild. Specifically, we introduce RealisDance-DiT, built upon the Wan-2.1 video foundation model. Our sufficient analysis reveals that the widely adopted Reference Net design is suboptimal for large-scale DiT models. Instead, we demonstrate that minimal modifications to the foundation model architecture yield a surprisingly strong baseline. We further propose the low-noise warmup and "large batches and small iterations" strategies to accelerate model convergence during fine-tuning while maximally preserving the priors of the foundation model. In addition, we introduce a new test dataset that captures diverse real-world challenges, complementing existing benchmarks such as TikTok dataset and UBC fashion video dataset, to comprehensively evaluate the proposed method. Extensive experiments show that RealisDance-DiT outperforms existing methods by a large margin.
