[ 1 3 0 0 5 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aOne approach to reducing the massive costs of large language models (LLMs) is the use of quantized or sparse representations for training or deployment. While post-training compression methods are very popular, the question of obtaining even more accurate compressed models by directly training over such representations, i.e., Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), is still open: for example, recent study (Kumar et al., 2024) put the optimal bit-width at which models can be trained using QAT, while staying accuracycompetitive with standard FP16/BF16 precision, at 8-bits weights and activations. We advance this state-of-the-art via new method called QuEST, which is Pareto-competitive with FP16, i.e., it provides better accuracy at lower model size, while training models with weights and activations in 4-bits or less. Moreover, QuEST allows stable training with 1-bit weights and activations. QuEST achieves this by improving two key aspects of QAT methods: (1) accurate and fast quantization of the (continuous) distributions of weights and activations via Hadamard normalization and MSE-optimal fitting; (2) new trust gradient estimator based on the idea of explicitly minimizing the error between the noisy gradient computed over quantized states and the true (but unknown) full-precision gradient. Experiments on Llama-type architectures show that QuEST induces stable scaling laws across the entire range of hardware-supported precisions, and can be extended to sparse representations. We provide GPU kernel support showing that models produced by QuEST can be executed efficiently. Our code is available at https: //github.com/IST-DASLab/QuEST. 1. Introduction The massive computational demands of large language models (LLMs), e.g. (Dubey et al., 2024), have made AI ef1ISTA 2Red Hat AI. Correspondence to: Andrei Panferov <andrei@panferov.org>, Dan Alistarh <dan.alistarh@ist.ac.at>. 1 Figure 1. The scaling law induced by QuEST when training Llamafamily models from 30 to 800M parameters on C4, with quantized weights and activations from 1 to 4 bits, in the 100 tokens/parameter regime (higher compression uses proportionally more data at fixed memory). QuEST allows for stable training at 1bit weights and activations (W1A1), and the QuEST W4A4 model is Pareto-dominant relative to BF16, with lower loss at lower size. ficiency critical challenge. One popular pathway to increased efficiency has been reducing numerical precision, usually done via post-training quantization (PTQ) methods for compressing weights (Frantar et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2024; Chee et al., 2024; Tseng et al., 2024) or both weights and activations (Ashkboos et al., 2023; 2024; Zhao et al., 2023). Quantizing both operands is necessary to leverage hardware support for low-precision multiplications, which extends down to 4-bit (NVIDIA, 2024). However, stateof-the-art PTQ methods are still far from recovering full accuracy for 4-bit precision (Ashkboos et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024), leaving gap between computational support and achievable accuracy. One alternative is quantization-aware training (QAT) (Rastegari et al., 2016; Jacob et al., 2018) where models are trained from scratch with low-precision weights and activations on the forward pass, but with full-precision backward passoffering the potential for superior accuracy-vscompression trade-offs, as gradient optimization can correct compression errors. Despite promising results for weightonly quantization (Wang et al., 2023; Kaushal et al., 2024), it is currently not known whether QAT can produce accurate LLMs with low-bitwidth weights and activations. Here, the key metric is the Pareto-optimal frontier, i.e., the minimal representation size (or inference cost) for the model to Training Accurate LLMs with Low-Bit Weights and Activations achieve certain accuracy under fixed data or training budget. Recently, Kumar et al. (2024) identified 8-bit precision as Pareto-optimal for QAT methods on LLMs. Contribution. We present QuEST, new QAT method that brings the Pareto-optimal frontier to around 4-bit weights and activations and enables stable training at 1-bit precision for both operands. As shown in Figure 1, when data and compute are scaled proportionally to model size, QuEST can train models with 4-bit weights and activations that have superior accuracy relative to BF16 models almost 4x in size. We achieve this by re-thinking two key aspects of QAT methods: 1) the forward step, in which continuous-to-discrete tensor distribution fitting is performed on the forward pass, and 2) the backward step, in which gradient estimation is performed over the discrete representation. For the forward step, QuEST works by approximating the optimal continuous-to-discrete mapping by first applying normalizing Hadamard Transform, and then computing an MSEoptimal quantization for the resulting distribution. This replaces the prior learned normalization approaches (Choi et al., 2018; Bhalgat et al., 2020). The key remaining question is how to find an accurate gradient estimator over weight or activation tensor quantized as above. Here, prior work leverages the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) (Bengio et al., 2013), augmented with learnable components, e.g. (Bhalgat et al., 2020). We propose different approach called trust estimation, which seeks to minimize the difference between the true gradient (taken over high-precision weights) and its estimate taken over lower-precision weights and activations. To do this, trust estimator diminishes the importance of the gradient for some components depending on their quantization error on the forward step, following the intuition that entries with large errors lead to significant deviations in the gradient. Next, we focus on the following question: assuming that training computation is not limiting factor, what is the optimal precision in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size? To address this, we implement QuEST in Pytorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and train Llama-family models (Dubey et al., 2024) of up to 800M parameters on up to 80B tokens from the standard C4 dataset (Raffel et al., 2019), across precisions from INT1 to INT8. Results show that QuEST provides stable and accurate convergence across model sizes and precisions down to 1-bit weights and activations. "

Text:"Scaling Laws in Patchification: An Image Is Worth 50,176 Tokens And More Feng Wang 1 Yaodong Yu 2 Guoyizhe Wei 1 Wei Shao 3 Yuyin Zhou 4 Alan Yuille 1 Cihang Xie 4 1 Johns Hopkins University 2 UC Berkeley 3 University of Florida 4 UC Santa Cruz 5 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 8 3 7 3 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract Since the introduction of Vision Transformer (ViT), patchification has long been regarded as de facto image tokenization approach for plain visual architectures. By compressing the spatial size of images, this approach can effectively shorten the token sequence and reduce the computational cost of ViT-like plain architectures. In this work, we aim to thoroughly examine the information loss caused by this patchification-based compressive encoding paradigm and how it affects visual understanding. We conduct extensive patch size scaling experiments and excitedly observe an intriguing scaling law in patchification: the models can consistently benefit from decreased patch sizes and attain improved predictive performance, until it reaches the minimum patch size of 11, i.e., pixel tokenization. This conclusion is broadly applicable across different vision tasks, various input scales, and diverse architectures such as ViT and the recent Mamba models. Moreover, as by-product, we discover that with smaller patches, task-specific decoder heads become less critical for dense prediction. In the experiments, we successfully scale up the visual sequence to an exceptional length of 50,176 tokens, achieving competitive test accuracy of 84.6% with base-sized model on the ImageNet1k benchmark. We hope this study can provide insights and theoretical foundations for future works of building non-compressive vision models. Code is available at https://github.com/ wangf3014/Patch_Scaling. 1.

One approach to reducing the massive costs of large language models (LLMs) is the use of quantized or sparse representations for training or deployment. While post-training compression methods are very popular, the question of obtaining even more accurate compressed models by directly training over such representations, i.e., Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), is still open: for example, a recent study (arXiv:2411.04330v2) put the "optimal" bit-width at which models can be trained using QAT, while staying accuracy-competitive with standard FP16/BF16 precision, at 8-bits weights and activations.   We advance this state-of-the-art via a new method called QuEST, which is Pareto-competitive with FP16, i.e., it provides better accuracy at lower model size, while training models with weights and activations in 4-bits or less. Moreover, QuEST allows stable training with 1-bit weights and activations. QuEST achieves this by improving two key aspects of QAT methods: (1) accurate and fast quantization of the (continuous) distributions of weights and activations via Hadamard normalization and MSE-optimal fitting; (2) a new trust gradient estimator based on the idea of explicitly minimizing the error between the noisy gradient computed over quantized states and the "true" (but unknown) full-precision gradient. Experiments on Llama-type architectures show that QuEST induces stable scaling laws across the entire range of hardware-supported precisions, and can be extended to sparse representations. We provide GPU kernel support showing that models produced by QuEST can be executed efficiently. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/QuEST.

Precise alignment in Text-to-Image (T2I) systems is crucial to ensure that generated visuals not only accurately encapsulate user intents but also conform to stringent ethical and aesthetic benchmarks. Incidents like the Google Gemini fiasco, where misaligned outputs triggered significant public backlash, underscore the critical need for robust alignment mechanisms. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved notable success in alignment. Building on these advancements, researchers are eager to apply similar alignment techniques, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), to T2I systems to enhance image generation fidelity and reliability.   We present YinYangAlign, an advanced benchmarking framework that systematically quantifies the alignment fidelity of T2I systems, addressing six fundamental and inherently contradictory design objectives. Each pair represents fundamental tensions in image generation, such as balancing adherence to user prompts with creative modifications or maintaining diversity alongside visual coherence. YinYangAlign includes detailed axiom datasets featuring human prompts, aligned (chosen) responses, misaligned (rejected) AI-generated outputs, and explanations of the underlying contradictions.

Since the introduction of Vision Transformer (ViT), patchification has long been regarded as a de facto image tokenization approach for plain visual architectures. By compressing the spatial size of images, this approach can effectively shorten the token sequence and reduce the computational cost of ViT-like plain architectures. In this work, we aim to thoroughly examine the information loss caused by this patchification-based compressive encoding paradigm and how it affects visual understanding. We conduct extensive patch size scaling experiments and excitedly observe an intriguing scaling law in patchification: the models can consistently benefit from decreased patch sizes and attain improved predictive performance, until it reaches the minimum patch size of 1x1, i.e., pixel tokenization. This conclusion is broadly applicable across different vision tasks, various input scales, and diverse architectures such as ViT and the recent Mamba models. Moreover, as a by-product, we discover that with smaller patches, task-specific decoder heads become less critical for dense prediction. In the experiments, we successfully scale up the visual sequence to an exceptional length of 50,176 tokens, achieving a competitive test accuracy of 84.6% with a base-sized model on the ImageNet-1k benchmark. We hope this study can provide insights and theoretical foundations for future works of building non-compressive vision models. Code is available at https://github.com/wangf3014/Patch_Scaling.
