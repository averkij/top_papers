Introduction Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2024) helps Transformer models understand word order by assigning each token unique positional marker calculated using mathematical rotation matrix. RoPE has advantages in longcontext understanding (Ding et al., 2024b), and continues to be default choice in leading Large Language Models (LLMs) like the LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Dubey *Equal contribution 1Fudan University, Shanghai, China 2Shanghai AI Laboratory, Shanghai, China 3Shanghai Innovation Institute, Shanghai, China. 2D/3D Structure Frequency Allocation Spatial Symmetry Temporal Index Scaling Vanilla RoPE (Su et al., 2024) TAD-RoPE (Gao et al., 2024) RoPE-Tie (Su, 2024a) M-RoPE (Wang et al., 2024b) VideoRoPE (Ours) Table 1. Comparison between different RoPE variants for Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs). Figure 1. VideoRoPE outperforms RoPE variants on benchmarks. et al., 2024) and QWen (Yang et al., 2024a;b) series. The original RoPE implementation (Vanilla RoPE) (Su et al., 2024) is designed for sequential 1D data like text. However, recent Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) (Li et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023a; Chen et al., 2024a; Maaz et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024d; Wang et al., 2024d; Chen et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024b) process video, which has more complex spatio and temporal structure. As shown in Tab. 1, although several RoPE-based approaches (Gao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b) have been proposed to support video inputs, these variants exhibit limitations and do not fully satisfy the following key characteristics: (1) 2D/3D Structure. Some existing Video LLMs direct flatten the video frame into 1D embeddings and apply the 1D structure RoPE (Su et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2024). These solutions fail to capture video datas inherent 2D or 3D (temporal (t), horizontal (x), and vertical (y)) structure, thus hindering explicit spatial and temporal representation. (2) Frequency Allocation. Previous approaches such as M-RoPE used in QWen2-VL (Wang et al., 2024b) employ 3D structure, dividing the feature dimensions into distinct 1 VideoRoPE: What Makes for Good Video Rotary Position Embedding? Figure 2. Left: To demonstrate the importance of frequential allocation, based on VIAH (a) we present more challenging V-NIAH-D task (b) that similar images are inserted as distractors. Right: Compared to M-RoPE, our VideoRoPE is more robust in retrieval and is less affected by distractors. subsets for (t, x, y) encoding, respectively. How to determine the optimal allocation of these dimension subsets, and consequently their associated frequencies 1 are not well studied. Some previous work allocates the lower dimensions corresponding to the high frequency to represent the t. However, the temporal dimension is significantly tortured by periodic oscillation, and distant positions may have the same embeddings. We present simple setting to verify this point. Based on the previous long-video retrieval task V-NIAH (Visual Needle-In-A-Haystack) (Zhang et al., 2024d), we insert several similar images that do not affect the questions answer before and after the needle image as distractor (Hsieh et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024), forming new task, V-NIAH-D (Visual Needle-In-A-Haystack with Distractors). As shown in Fig. 2, we find that previous M-RoPE is misled by distractors, showing significant performance decline from V-NIAH to V-NIAH-D. Our observation demonstrates that the periodic oscillation reduces Video LLMs robustness. (3) Spatial Symmetry. The distance between the end of the precedent textual input and the start of visual input equals the distance between the end of visual input and the start of subsequent textual input (Su, 2024b). Such symmetry ensures that the visual input receives equal contextual influence from both the preceding and subsequent textual information. (4) Temporal Index Scaling. Spatial and temporal dimensions often exhibit different granularities (e.g., unit change in x/y differs from unit change in t) (Gao et al., 2024). 1In RoPE, frequencies are determined by β2n/d, where β is constant, is the dimension index, is the total number of dimensions. Thus, choosing which dimensions represent t, x, and directly determines the frequencies used for each. Employing varying index intervals in positional encoding allows for dimension-specific encoding, capturing diverse scales and enhancing efficiency. Driven by our analysis, we present new video position embedding strategy, VideoRoPE, which can simultaneously satisfy the four properties in Tab. 1. Specifically, we use 3D structure to model spatiotemporal information, allocating higher dimensions (lower frequencies), to the temporal axis (Low-frequency Temporal Allocation, LTA) to prioritize temporal modeling. The right panel of Fig. 2 demonstrates that our LTA allocation mitigates oscillations and exhibits robustness to distractors in the V-NIAH-D t"

Text:"CodeSteer: Symbolic-Augmented Language Models via Code/Text Guidance Yongchao Chen 1 2 Yilun Hao 1 Yueying Liu 3 Yang Zhang 4 Chuchu FanExisting methods fail to effectively steer Large Language Models (LLMs) between textual reasoning and code generation, leaving symbolic computing capabilities underutilized. We introduce CodeSteer, an effective method for guiding LLM code/text generation. We construct comprehensive benchmark SymBench comprising 37 symbolic tasks with adjustable complexity and also synthesize datasets of 12k multi-round guidance/generation trajectories and 5.5k guidance comparison pairs. We fine-tune the Llama3-8B model with newly designed multi-round supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). The resulting model, CodeSteerLLM, augmented with the proposed symbolic and self-answer checkers, effectively guides the code/text generation of larger models. Augmenting GPT-4o with CodeSteer raises its average performance score from 53.3 to 86.4, even outperforming the existing best LLM OpenAI o1 (82.7), o1-preview (74.8), and DeepSeek R1 (76.8) across all 37 tasks (28 seen, 9 unseen). Trained for GPT-4o, CodeSteer demonstrates superior generalizability, providing an average 41.8 performance boost on Claude, Mistral, and GPT3.5. CodeSteer-guided LLMs fully harness symbolic computing to maintain strong performance on highly complex tasks.

Introduction While the reasoning and planning capabilities of LLMs have improved significantly (Wang et al., 2024; Chen et al., 1Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA, USA 2Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA 3University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA 4MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Boston, MA, USA. Correspondence to: Yongchao Chen <yongchaochen@fas.harvard.edu>, Chuchu Fan <chuchu@mit.edu>. 1 2024c; Li et al., 2023), they still fail in ostensibly simple tasks (Zhou et al., 2024a). Crucially, many tasks in existing benchmarkssuch as Blocksworld (Valmeekam et al., 2024) and Game 24 (Zhou et al., 2023b)can be completely solved with code solutions. Text-based reasoning excels at semantic understanding and commonsense inference but is less suited for exact computation, symbolic manipulation, optimization, and algorithmic processing (Valmeekam et al., 2022). In contrast, symbolic computing via code generation is adept at handling rigorous operations and can easily leverage specialized tools (e.g., equation solvers). In many tasks, prompting LLMs to generate and execute code outperforms purely textual reasoning (Madaan et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022). key challenge is guiding LLMs to decide when to rely on textual reasoning versus programmatic solutions, given that most input questions lack explicit cues about which approach is best. Recent OpenAI GPT models address this by providing Code Interpreter module, allowing the model to iteratively generate and execute code, then further reason with the output (Achiam et al., 2023). Multi-agent frameworks like AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023) adopt specialized system prompt to steer LLM for code generation when needed. However, recently Chen et al. (2024e) finds that all these existing methods struggle to effectively steer between textual reasoning and code generation, failing to fully leverage symbolic computing capabilities. Our work tries to bridge this gap by developing an assistant framework (CodeSteer) to guide the code/text generation of the LLM solving the task (TaskLLM). By fine-tuning small model (Llama-3-8B (Dubey et al., 2024)) to be the assistant, we enable large models (GPT-4o (Achiam et al., 2023)) to fully leverage symbolic computing via code generation while preserving other capabilities. Recognizing that iterative executing and exploring is the most effective way to solve tasks, we build CodeSteer to generate prompts that guide the TaskLLM through multiple rounds of interaction before finalizing answers. To achieve comprehensive evaluation, we gather and develop benchmark with 37 symbolic tasks, referred as SymBench. On SymBench, augmenting GPT-4o with CodeSteer greatly improves its average performance score from 53.3 to 86.4, even outperforming the current leading pure-text CodeSteer: Symbolic-Augmented Language Models via Code/Text Guidance Figure 1: Examples and performance of CodeSteer on guiding LLM code/text generation to integrate symbolic computing. At each interaction with TaskLLM, it reviews current and previous answers, then provides guidance for the next round. CodeSteer returns final answers when it deems them ready. With CodeSteer, GPT-4o outperforms OpenAI Code Interpreter, o1, and o1-preview models. model, OpenAI o1 (82.7) (Jaech et al., 2024) and DeepSeek R1 (76.8) (Guo et al., 2025). Although trained for GPT-4o, CodeSteer shows great generalizability, delivering an average 41.8 performance gain on Claude-3-5-Sonnet, MistralLarge, and GPT-3.5. By fully leveraging symbolic computing, CodeSteer-guided LLMs maintain strong performance on highly complex tasks even when o1 fails in all testing cases. Our key contributions are: 1) Developing and publishing SymBench: Prior works by Chen et al. (2024e) and Gui et al. (2024) gathered and developed 14 and 31 tasks, respectively, targeting challenges in computation, symbolic manipulation, logic, optimization, spatial reasoning, and constrained planning. However, neither study published the complete code for question/solution synthesis or the full datasets. From these 45 tasks, we select 37 that remain challenging for GPT-4o and redevelop their generation code to produce samples with adjustable complexity. We refer to this newly published benchmark as SymBench. 2) New methods for dataset construction and model fine-tuning of SFT and DPO: We fine-tune Llama-3-8B with the synthesized datasets of 12k multi-round guidance/generation trajectories (SFT) and 5.5k guidance comparison pairs (DPO). Unlike standard multi-step settings, in CodeSteers multi-round guidance, the TaskLLM outputs complete answer each round rather than only at the end. Consequently, we introduce novel components to both the dataset construction and training processes for SFT and DPO, such as data synthesis of dynamic guidance adaptation, emphasis on the final two rounds in SFT, comparison score design, and efficient answer sampling in DPO.

"While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and its variants are widely adopted for their long-context capabilities, the extension of the 1D RoPE to video, with its complex spatio-temporal structure, remains an open challenge. This work first introduces a comprehensive analysis that identifies four key characteristics essential for the effective adaptation of RoPE to video, which have not been fully considered in prior work. As part of our analysis, we introduce a challenging V-NIAH-D (Visual Needle-In-A-Haystack with Distractors) task, which adds periodic distractors into V-NIAH. The V-NIAH-D task demonstrates that previous RoPE variants, lacking appropriate temporal dimension allocation, are easily misled by distractors. Based on our analysis, we introduce VideoRoPE, with a 3D structure designed to preserve spatio-temporal relationships. VideoRoPE features low-frequency temporal allocation to mitigate periodic oscillations, a diagonal layout to maintain spatial symmetry, and adjustable temporal spacing to decouple temporal and spatial indexing. VideoRoPE consistently surpasses previous RoPE variants, across diverse downstream tasks such as long video retrieval, video understanding, and video hallucination. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Wiselnn570/VideoRoPE{https://github.com/Wiselnn570/VideoRoPE}."

Agency is a system's capacity to steer outcomes toward a goal, and is a central topic of study across biology, philosophy, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Determining if a system exhibits agency is a notoriously difficult question: Dennett (1989), for instance, highlights the puzzle of determining which principles can decide whether a rock, a thermostat, or a robot each possess agency. We here address this puzzle from the viewpoint of reinforcement learning by arguing that agency is fundamentally frame-dependent: Any measurement of a system's agency must be made relative to a reference frame. We support this claim by presenting a philosophical argument that each of the essential properties of agency proposed by Barandiaran et al. (2009) and Moreno (2018) are themselves frame-dependent. We conclude that any basic science of agency requires frame-dependence, and discuss the implications of this claim for reinforcement learning.

The integration of slow-thinking mechanisms into large language models (LLMs) offers a promising way toward achieving Level 2 AGI Reasoners, as exemplified by systems like OpenAI's o1. However, several significant challenges remain, including inefficient overthinking and an overreliance on auxiliary reward models. We point out that these limitations stem from LLMs' inability to internalize the search process, a key component of effective reasoning. A critical step toward addressing this issue is enabling LLMs to autonomously determine when and where to backtrack, a fundamental operation in traditional search algorithms. To this end, we propose a self-backtracking mechanism that equips LLMs with the ability to backtrack during both training and inference. This mechanism not only enhances reasoning ability but also efficiency by transforming slow-thinking processes into fast-thinking through self-improvement. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposal significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, achieving a performance gain of over 40 percent compared to the optimal-path supervised fine-tuning method. We believe this study introduces a novel and promising pathway for developing more advanced and robust Reasoners.

Existing methods fail to effectively steer Large Language Models (LLMs) between textual reasoning and code generation, leaving symbolic computing capabilities underutilized. We introduce CodeSteer, an effective method for guiding LLM code/text generation. We construct a comprehensive benchmark SymBench comprising 37 symbolic tasks with adjustable complexity and also synthesize datasets of 12k multi-round guidance/generation trajectories and 5.5k guidance comparison pairs. We fine-tune the Llama-3-8B model with a newly designed multi-round supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). The resulting model, CodeSteerLLM, augmented with the proposed symbolic and self-answer checkers, effectively guides the code/text generation of larger models. Augmenting GPT-4o with CodeSteer raises its average performance score from 53.3 to 86.4, even outperforming the existing best LLM OpenAI o1 (82.7), o1-preview (74.8), and DeepSeek R1 (76.8) across all 37 tasks (28 seen, 9 unseen). Trained for GPT-4o, CodeSteer demonstrates superior generalizability, providing an average 41.8 performance boost on Claude, Mistral, and GPT-3.5. CodeSteer-guided LLMs fully harness symbolic computing to maintain strong performance on highly complex tasks. Models, Datasets, and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/CodeSteer-v1.0.

"Existing methods fail to effectively steer Large Language Models (LLMs) between textual reasoning and code generation, leaving symbolic computing capabilities underutilized. We introduce CodeSteer, an effective method for guiding LLM code/text generation. We construct a comprehensive benchmark SymBench comprising 37 symbolic tasks with adjustable complexity and also synthesize datasets of 12k multi-round guidance/generation trajectories and 5.5k guidance comparison pairs. We fine-tune the Llama-3-8B model with a newly designed multi-round supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). The resulting model, CodeSteerLLM, augmented with the proposed symbolic and self-answer checkers, effectively guides the code/text generation of larger models. Augmenting GPT-4o with CodeSteer raises its average performance score from 53.3 to 86.4, even outperforming the existing best LLM OpenAI o1 (82.7), o1-preview (74.8), and DeepSeek R1 (76.8) across all 37 tasks (28 seen, 9 unseen). Trained for GPT-4o, CodeSteer demonstrates superior generalizability, providing an average 41.8 performance boost on Claude, Mistral, and GPT-3.5. CodeSteer-guided LLMs fully harness symbolic computing to maintain strong performance on highly complex tasks. Models, Datasets, and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/CodeSteer-v1.0."
