INTRODUCTION HE progress made in text-to-3D scene generation signifies significant step forward in the field of 3D content creation [1][12]. It has extended its reach from generating simple objects to building intricate, detailed scenes straight from the textual descriptions. This advancement not only lightens the burden on 3D modelers but also stimulates expansion in industries like gaming, film, and architecture. Text-to-3D methods [1][12] typically use pre-trained 2D text-to-image models [13][15] as prior supervision to create object-centric 3D differentiable representations [16][20] by rendering image from the cameras perspective facing towards the object. Generating text-to-3D scenes require rendering This work was supported by Anhui Province Science and Technology Innovation Breakthrough Plan (202423l10050033) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFB3105405, 2021YFC3300502).

However, as shown in Fig. 1, these text-to-3D generation techniques face several significant obstacles, including: 1) lack of automation, often relying on manual layout design or hardcoded placement trajectories, thereby reducing usability and scalability [21][24]; 2) Inconsistent 3D visual cues [21][23], [25][28], with satisfactory outputs restrained to only training camera poses, similar to 360-degree photography, which limits their applicability in interactive or exploratory tasks within the generated 3D environment.; 3) An inefficient generation process often results in subpar outputs [21], [25], [26], [29] and extended completion times [22], [27]; 4) The inability to distinguish objects from their environments, which obstructs flexible editing on individual components [22], [23], [25], [27]. To address these limitations, we present DreamScene, an end-to-end framework that enables automated, efficient, scene-consistent, and flexibly editable 3D scene generation. Firstly, we perform scene planning by decomposing the scene into structured object-level and environment-level components. Given either an open-ended scene prompt or an interactive dialogue, GPT-4 agent [30] infers detailed information for each object, including its category, real-world size, and descriptive prompt. Based on these results, the agent assigns coarse placements by predicting region-level anchors (e.g., center, side, corner) and inter-object spatial relations (e.g., next to, opposite). We organize these spatial constraints into hybrid constraint graph, capturing both object-to-object and object-to-scene relationships. To compute valid layout, we propose graph-based constraint placement (GCP) algorithm that incrementally assigns position and orientation to each object while avoiding collisions. This yields physically plausible, semantically consistent object arrangement and provides affine parametersscaling s,translation and rotation rfor each object to be used in downstream generation. Secondly, we generate 3D object representations using Formation Pattern Sampling (FPS) guided by descriptive prompts from the planning stage. Based on the observed patterns in 3D representation formation, FPS utilizes multi-timestep sampling (MTS) to balance semantic information and shape consistency, enabling the rapid generation of high-quality, semantically rich 3D representations. FPS ensures stable generation performance by eliminating redundant internal 3D Gaussians during optimization. And, by employing DDPM [31] with small timestep sampling and 3D reconstruction techniques [18], FPS efficiently generates surfaces with plausible textures from various viewpoints in just tens of seconds. IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE 2 Fig. 1. DreamScene exhibits significant advantages compared with current state-of-the-art text-to-3D scene generation methods. Text2Room [22] and Setthe-Scene [21] require complex user-specified object placement.

"DreamScene is an end-to-end framework that generates high-quality, editable 3D scenes from text or dialogue, ensuring automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control through a combination of scene planning, graph-based placement, formation pattern sampling, and progressive camera sampling.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for applications in gaming, film, and design. However, existing methods struggle with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and 4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available at https://jahnsonblack.github.io/DreamScene-Full/."
