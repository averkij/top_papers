Xinyu Guan (2001gxy@gmail.com) is with Peking University, Youran Sun is with Tsinghua University. Figure 1: The overview of rStar-Math. In the test-time compute paradigm, the key is to train powerful policy model that generates promising solution steps and reliable reward model that accurately evaluates them, both of which depend on high-quality training data. Unfortunately, it is well-known that off-the-shelf high-quality math reasoning data is scarce, and synthesizing high-quality math data faces fundamental challenges. For the policy model, it is challenging to distinguish erroneous reasoning steps from the correct ones, complicating the elimination of low-quality data. It is worth noting that in math reasoning, correct final answer does not ensure the correctness of the entire reasoning trace [Lanham et al., 2023]. Incorrect intermediate steps significantly decrease data quality. As for the reward model, process reward modeling (PRM) shows great potential by providing fine-grained feedback on intermediate steps [Lightman et al., 2023]. However, the training data is even scarcer in this regard: accurate step-by-step feedback requires intense human labeling efforts and is impractical to scale, while those automatic annotation attempts show limited gains due to noisy reward scores [Luo et al., 2024, Wang et al., 2024c, Chen et al., 2024]. Due to the above challenges, existing distill-based data synthesis approaches to training policy models, e.g., scaling up GPT4-distilled CoT data [Tang et al., 2024, Huang et al., 2024], have shown diminishing returns and cannot exceed the capability of their teacher model; meanwhile, as of today, training reliable PRMs for math reasoning remains an open question. In this work, we introduce rStar-Math, self-evolvable System 2-style reasoning approach that achieves the state-of-the-art math reasoning, rivaling and sometimes even surpassing OpenAI o1 on challenging math competition benchmarks with model size as small as 7 billion. Unlike solutions relying on superior LLMs for data synthesis, rStar-Math leverages smaller language models (SLMs) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to establish self-evolutionary process, iteratively generating higher-quality training data. To achieve self-evolution, rStar-Math introduces three key innovations. First, novel code-augmented CoT data synthesis method, which performs extensive MCTS rollouts to generate step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories with self-annotated MCTS Q-values. Specifically, math problem-solving is decomposed into multi-step generation within MCTS. At each step, the SLM serving as the policy model samples candidate nodes, each generating one-step CoT and the corresponding Python code. To verify the generation quality, only nodes with successful Python code execution are retained, thus mitigating errors in intermediate steps. Moreover, extensive MCTS rollouts automatically assign Q-value to each intermediate step based on its contribution: steps contributing to more trajectories that lead to the correct answer are given higher Q-values and considered higher quality. This ensures that the reasoning trajectories generated by SLMs consist of correct, high-quality intermediate steps. Second, novel method that trains an SLM acting as process preference model, i.e., PPM to implement the desired PRM, that reliably predicts reward label for each math reasoning step. The PPM leverages the fact that, although Q-values are still not precise enough to score each reasoning step despite using extensive MCTS rollouts, the Q-values can reliably distinguish positive (correct) steps from negative (irrelevant/incorrect) ones. Thus the training method constructs preference pairs for each step based on Q-values and uses pairwise ranking loss [Ouyang et al., 2022] to optimize PPMs score prediction for each reasoning step, achieving reliable labeling. This approach avoids conventional methods that directly use Q-values as reward labels [Luo et al., 2024, Chen et al., 2024], which are inherently noisy and imprecise in stepwise reward assignment. Finally, four-round self-evolution recipe that progressively builds both frontier policy "

Document retrieval techniques form the foundation for the development of large-scale information systems. The prevailing methodology is to construct a bi-encoder and compute the semantic similarity. However, such scalar similarity is difficult to reflect enough information and impedes our comprehension of the retrieval results. In addition, this computational process mainly emphasizes the global semantics and ignores the fine-grained semantic relationship between the query and the complex text in the document. In this paper, we propose a new method called Generation Augmented Retrieval (GeAR) that incorporates well-designed fusion and decoding modules. This enables GeAR to generate the relevant text from documents based on the fused representation of the query and the document, thus learning to "focus on" the fine-grained information. Also when used as a retriever, GeAR does not add any computational burden over bi-encoders. To support the training of the new framework, we have introduced a pipeline to efficiently synthesize high-quality data by utilizing large language models. GeAR exhibits competitive retrieval and localization performance across diverse scenarios and datasets. Moreover, the qualitative analysis and the results generated by GeAR provide novel insights into the interpretation of retrieval results. The code, data, and models will be released after completing technical review to facilitate future research.
