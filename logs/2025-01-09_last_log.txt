Correspondence to: Yujiu Yang <yang.yujiu@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn>, Co-First Author: <lrl23@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn>. 1 Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has proven to be highly effective in mathematical reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs), serving various roles from multiple perspectives (Zhang et al., 2024e; Wei et al., 2022; Chu et al., 2023; Sprague et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2022; An et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2024b; Mu et al., 2024). Recently, numerous studies have focused on supervising the quality of CoT-style reasoning during inference to investigate test-time scaling laws and push the performance boundaries of these models (Zhang et al., 2024b; Lightman et al., 2023; Setlur et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2024b). However, this pathway has not been fully explored in the context of mathematical reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Before considering the introduction of CoT supervision paradigm for multimodal mathematical reasoning, we first identify the limitations of existing work: i) General MLLMs, which perform well across various leaderboards, are designed with balanced development approach. The models not specifically focus on enhancing mathematical capabilities, particularly in high-difficulty scenarios such as complex geometry problems (Shi et al., 2023). ii) Meanwhile, current open-source models in the multimodal mathematics do not yet exhibit satisfactory CoT reasoning capabilities. This may be due to the lack of high-quality and sophisticated CoTformatted reasoning data in the training datasets, restricting models to merely fitting short output patterns (Zhang et al., 2024e; Yang et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2023). To address the need for enhanced CoT reasoning capabilities in the multimodal mathematical domain, we begin by selecting LLM specifically designed for mathematical reasoning as our LLM backbone. During the instruction fine-tuning phase, we extensively collect existing open-source training data from the mathematical domain, including datasets such as Multimath (Peng et al., 2024), MAVIS (Zhang et al., 2024d), PUMA-VarsityTutors (Zhuang et al., 2024), and MathV-360K (Shi et al., 2024), which cover tasks like geometry problem solving, math word problems, and table QA. However, we observed that high-quality CoT-formatted reasoning data is either scarce or not sufficiently sophisticated. Recognizing the importance of CoT reasoning, we syntheURSA: Understanding and Verifying Chain-of-thought Reasoning in Multimodal Mathematics Figure 1: We compare the reasoning ability of URSA-7B and other open-source MLLMs across different topics on MathVista and MathVerse, as well as their reasoning stability when faced with changes in modal information content. size targeted CoT-style data to create 1M high-quality instruction fine-tuning dataset. This significantly enhances MLLMs potential to reach their upper limits in mathematical reasoning. After developing robust CoT reasoning trajectory constructor, we consider to further achieve superior CoT reasoning with an advanced process reward model (PRM). However, in the context of MLLMs, additional challenges arise due to the integration of multimodal information. In multimodal scenarios, errors extend beyond typical logical inconsistencies in text-based reasoning, including modality-specific mismatches (Wang et al., 2024b; Gao et al., 2024; Liang et al., 2024). For instance, during the reasoning process of MLLMs, hallucinations such as coordinate recognition errors and ambiguous edge-angle relationships can occur, which may not be adequately addressed by the model. Therefore, when refining the multimodal PRM, it is crucial to reward not only doing things right but also seeing things precisely. To tackle these challenges, we propose novel dual-view process supervision data synthesis method aiming at error localization. This involves synthesizing data by employing binary error step localization with the Monte Carlo Tree Search (Browne et al., 2012) and step-wise targeted hallucination injection prompting, relying on the models own reasoning data distribution and the capabilities of external MLLMs, respectively. We evaluate URSA-7B on several widely-used datasets, such as MathVista (Lu et al., 2023a), MathVerse (Zhang et al., 2025), WE-MATH (Qiao et al., 2024), and DYNAMATH (Zou et al., 2024). URSA-7B not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among models of the same size but also surpasses powerful closed-source models in certain types of questions and dimensions. Additionally, our trained URSA-RM-7B effectively guides trajectory selection during reasoning, leading to better performance. The mai"

"Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely applied in the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, the introduction of derivative process supervision on CoT trajectories has sparked discussions on enhancing scaling capabilities during test time, thereby boosting the potential of these models. However, in multimodal mathematical reasoning, the scarcity of high-quality CoT training data has hindered existing models from achieving high-precision CoT reasoning and has limited the realization of reasoning potential during test time. In this work, we propose a three-module synthesis strategy that integrates CoT distillation, trajectory-format rewriting, and format unification. It results in a high-quality CoT reasoning instruction fine-tuning dataset in multimodal mathematics, MMathCoT-1M. We comprehensively validate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of the trained URSA-7B model on multiple multimodal mathematical benchmarks. For test-time scaling, we introduce a data synthesis strategy that automatically generates process annotation datasets, known as DualMath-1.1M, focusing on both interpretation and logic. By further training URSA-7B on DualMath-1.1M, we transition from CoT reasoning capabilities to robust supervision abilities. The trained URSA-RM-7B acts as a verifier, effectively enhancing the performance of URSA-7B at test time. URSA-RM-7B also demonstrates excellent out-of-distribution (OOD) verifying capabilities, showcasing its generalization. Model weights, training data and code will be open-sourced."

We study the problem of single-image 3D object reconstruction. Recent works have diverged into two directions: regression-based modeling and generative modeling. Regression methods efficiently infer visible surfaces, but struggle with occluded regions. Generative methods handle uncertain regions better by modeling distributions, but are computationally expensive and the generation is often misaligned with visible surfaces. In this paper, we present SPAR3D, a novel two-stage approach aiming to take the best of both directions. The first stage of SPAR3D generates sparse 3D point clouds using a lightweight point diffusion model, which has a fast sampling speed. The second stage uses both the sampled point cloud and the input image to create highly detailed meshes. Our two-stage design enables probabilistic modeling of the ill-posed single-image 3D task while maintaining high computational efficiency and great output fidelity. Using point clouds as an intermediate representation further allows for interactive user edits. Evaluated on diverse datasets, SPAR3D demonstrates superior performance over previous state-of-the-art methods, at an inference speed of 0.7 seconds.

The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked many applications but also underscores the challenge of aligning them with diverse values and preferences. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is central to alignment but constrained by fixed divergences and limited feature transformations. We propose DPO-Kernels, which integrates kernel methods to address these issues through four key contributions: (i) Kernelized Representations with polynomial, RBF, Mahalanobis, and spectral kernels for richer transformations, plus a hybrid loss combining embedding-based and probability-based objectives; (ii) Divergence Alternatives (Jensen-Shannon, Hellinger, Renyi, Bhattacharyya, Wasserstein, and f-divergences) for greater stability; (iii) Data-Driven Selection metrics that automatically choose the best kernel-divergence pair; and (iv) a Hierarchical Mixture of Kernels for both local precision and global modeling. Evaluations on 12 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in factuality, safety, reasoning, and instruction following. Grounded in Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, DPO-Kernels maintains robust generalization for LLMs, offering a comprehensive resource for further alignment research.

We propose DPO-Kernels, which integrates kernel methods to address these issues through four key contributions: (i) Kernelized Representations with polynomial, RBF, Mahalanobis, and spectral kernels for richer transformations, plus a hybrid loss combining embedding-based and probability-based objectives; (ii) Divergence Alternatives (Jensen-Shannon, Hellinger, Renyi, Bhattacharyya, Wasserstein, and f-divergences) for greater stability; (iii) Data-Driven Selection metrics that automatically choose the best kernel-divergence pair; and (iv) a Hierarchical Mixture of Kernels for both local precision and global modeling. Evaluations on 12 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in factuality, safety, reasoning, and instruction following. Grounded in Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, DPO-Kernels maintains robust generalization for LLMs, offering a comprehensive resource for further alignment research."
