Ultra3D uses VecSet and Part Attention to accelerate 3D voxel generation while maintaining high quality and resolution.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in sparse voxel representations have significantly improved the quality of 3D content generation, enabling high-resolution modeling with fine-grained geometry. However, existing frameworks suffer from severe computational inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in their two-stage diffusion pipelines. In this work, we propose Ultra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates sparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the compact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in the first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate prediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we introduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that restricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions. This design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global attention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this mechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ultra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference.

"Elevate3D enhances both texture and geometry of low-quality 3D assets using HFS-SDEdit and monocular geometry predictors, achieving superior refinement quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 High-quality 3D assets are essential for various applications in computer graphics and 3D vision but remain scarce due to significant acquisition costs. To address this shortage, we introduce Elevate3D, a novel framework that transforms readily accessible low-quality 3D assets into higher quality. At the core of Elevate3D is HFS-SDEdit, a specialized texture enhancement method that significantly improves texture quality while preserving the appearance and geometry while fixing its degradations. Furthermore, Elevate3D operates in a view-by-view manner, alternating between texture and geometry refinement. Unlike previous methods that have largely overlooked geometry refinement, our framework leverages geometric cues from images refined with HFS-SDEdit by employing state-of-the-art monocular geometry predictors. This approach ensures detailed and accurate geometry that aligns seamlessly with the enhanced texture. Elevate3D outperforms recent competitors by achieving state-of-the-art quality in 3D model refinement, effectively addressing the scarcity of high-quality open-source 3D assets."
