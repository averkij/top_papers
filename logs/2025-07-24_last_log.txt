Beijing, China longxiang1@modelbest.cn Zhi Zheng ModelBest Inc. Beijing, China zhengzhi@modelbest.cn Jinhua Gao ICT, CAS Beijing, China gaojinhua@ict.ac.cn Abstract Agentic search, as more autonomous and adaptive paradigm of retrieval augmentation, is driving the evolution of intelligent search systems. However, existing evaluation frameworks fail to align well with the goals of agentic search. First, the complex queries commonly used in current benchmarks often deviate from realistic user search scenarios. Second, prior approaches tend to introduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations, leading to distorted assessments at fine-grained level. Third, most current frameworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the evaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search. To address these limitations, we propose RAVinea Reality-Aligned eValuation framework for agentic LLMs with search. RAVine targets multi-point queries and long-form answers that better reflect user intents, and introduces an attributable ground truth construction strategy to enhance the accuracy of fine-grained evaluation. Moreover, RAVine examines models interaction with search tools throughout the iterative process, and accounts for factors of efficiency. We benchmark series of models using RAVine and derive several insights, which we hope will contribute to advancing the development of agentic search systems. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SwordFaith/RAVine. CCS Concepts Information systems Evaluation of retrieval results; Computing methodologies Natural language processing.
