Rather than humans browsing and clicking, vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and transact. This raises fundamental question: what do AI agents buyand why? We develop ACES, sandbox environment that pairs platform-agnostic VLM agent with fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags and platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption of universal top rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios where sellers themselves use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptionstargeting AI buyer preferencescan deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on few select products, raising competition questions.

Email: akshit.kumar@yale.eduAutonomous AI agents are poised to make shopping decisions for millions of consumers, reshaping the e-commerce ecosystem [14, 18, 33, 50]. new generation of computer-use systems such as OpenAIs Operator (automating grocery orders, form filling, flight booking) [29, 37] and Google DeepMinds Project Mariner (large-scale multi-tab shopping) [16, 55]promises to replace manual browsing with autonomous procurement. Industry leaders are already signaling strategic disruption; Walmarts CTO urges preparedness for third-party agents that circumvent traditional merchandising and advertising cues [6]. Today, consumers still interact with platforms directly. In the near future they may instead issue short prompt to personalized AI agent (augmented with purchase history and preferences), which then navigates, evaluates, and purchases with minimal human oversight (see Figure 5 in Appendix A). Such agents have the potential to significantly reduce search frictions for customers. In doing so, agents can systematically scan broader assortments than humans, potentially diluting the influence of classical monetization levers that platforms have, such as product rankings and ad placements. Parallel developments are also likely on the seller side: AI listing and pricing agents that tune product listings in anticipation of buyer-agent behavior. This shift foreshadows reconfigured e-commerce ecosystem and raises new design, strategy, and regulatory questions. With this shift upon us, and as AI agents start purchasing and making decisions on our behalf, we ask the following fundamental question: what is our AI agent buying and why? More concretely, we investigate various layers of questions. 1. Rational Behavior. Do agents satisfy basic instruction following and simple economic dominance tests? 2. Product Market Shares. What are product market shares when purchases are fully mediated by AI agents, and how do such market shares vary across AI agents? 3. Choice Behavior and Biases. How do AI agents respond to observable attributes (price, rating, reviews, text) and platform levers (position, promotions, sponsorship)? 4. Interaction between Buyer and Seller Agents. How might outcomes change when sellers and/or marketplace platforms deploy their own optimizing AI agents? The first question concerns minimum viability: without elementary rationality, higher-order design or policy levers may be moot (cf. the emphasis on baseline competence in [46]). The second and third probe in-the-wild behaviors. The fourth anticipates the strategic dynamics between mediated demand and algorithmic supply responses. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows. 2 ACES framework. We develop ACES (Agentic e-CommercE Simulator): (i) provider-agnostic VLM shopping agent and (ii) fully programmable mock e-commerce application (mock-app; see Figure 6). This framework enables control and randomization of page layout, product order, prices, ratings, reviews, and promotional / sponsored badges. This provides realistic shopping environment while preserving experimental control for causal attribution of how platform levers and listing attributes steer AI agents purchase decisions. Market shares under delegation. Using ACES, we study product selection shares when an assortment of eight products are presented with randomized product positions. We evaluate three model families (Claude 4 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and treat selection frequencies as proxy for market share in fully delegated world. We observe the following. (i) Model heterogeneity. Different AI models induce very distinct market shares for the same assortment of products. For example, for the fitness watch category, Claude Sonnet 4 selects the Fitbit Inspire model 45%, while GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Flash select it only about 25% of the time (see Figure 1). (ii) Concentration risk. For some categories, the market shares concentrate on few select products and some brands are never selected (e.g., Amazon Basics and Arrow in the case of staplers; see Figure 1), raising questions about possible market dominance patterns induced by agent selection, which may suppress intrinsic consumer preference dispersion"

Text:"TreeRanker: Fast and Model-agnostic Ranking System for Code Suggestions in IDEs Daniele Cipollone1,2, Egor Bogomolov1, Arie van Deursen2, Maliheh Izadi2 1JetBrains, Amsterdam, Netherlands 2Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands 5 2 0 2 4 ] . [ 1 5 5 4 2 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r AbstractToken-level code completion is one of the most critical features in modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). It assists developers by suggesting relevant identifiers and APIs during coding. While completions are typically derived from static analysis, their usefulness depends heavily on how they are ranked, as correct predictions buried deep in the list are rarely seen by users. Most current systems rely on handcrafted heuristics or lightweight machine learning models trained on user logs, which can be further improved to capture context information and generalize across projects and coding styles. In this work, we propose new scoring approach to ranking static completions using language models in lightweight and modelagnostic way. Our method organizes all valid completions into prefix tree and performs single greedy decoding pass to collect token-level scores across the tree. This enables precise tokenaware ranking without needing beam search, prompt engineering, or model adaptations. The approach is fast, architecture-agnostic, and compatible with already deployed models for code completion. These findings highlight practical and effective pathway for integrating language models into already existing tools within IDEs, and ultimately providing smarter and more responsive developer assistance. Index TermsRanking, Code Suggestions, Language Models, Integrated Development Environments, IDEs I.

Reinforcement learning combined with a large multimodal language model verifier enhances image editing performance in an autoregressive multimodal framework.  					AI-generated summary 				 We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at https://github.com/mair-lab/EARL.

ACES, a sandbox environment, studies AI agents' shopping behavior in a mock marketplace, revealing position effects, sensitivity to sponsored tags, endorsements, prices, ratings, and reviews, and highlighting implications for seller strategies and platform design.  					AI-generated summary 				 Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking, vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why? We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products, raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy, platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.

Together, our results illuminate how AI agents may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy, platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem."

A new scoring approach using language models ranks static code completions in IDEs by organizing them into a prefix tree and performing a single greedy decoding pass.  					AI-generated summary 				 Token-level code completion is one of the most critical features in modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). It assists developers by suggesting relevant identifiers and APIs during coding. While completions are typically derived from static analysis, their usefulness depends heavily on how they are ranked, as correct predictions buried deep in the list are rarely seen by users. Most current systems rely on hand-crafted heuristics or lightweight machine learning models trained on user logs, which can be further improved to capture context information and generalize across projects and coding styles. In this work, we propose a new scoring approach to ranking static completions using language models in a lightweight and model-agnostic way. Our method organizes all valid completions into a prefix tree and performs a single greedy decoding pass to collect token-level scores across the tree. This enables a precise token-aware ranking without needing beam search, prompt engineering, or model adaptations. The approach is fast, architecture-agnostic, and compatible with already deployed models for code completion. These findings highlight a practical and effective pathway for integrating language models into already existing tools within IDEs, and ultimately providing smarter and more responsive developer assistance.
