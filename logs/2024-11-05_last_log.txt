OpenAI's Sora highlights the potential of video generation for developing world models that adhere to fundamental physical laws. However, the ability of video generation models to discover such laws purely from visual data without human priors can be questioned. A world model learning the true law should give predictions robust to nuances and correctly extrapolate on unseen scenarios. In this work, we evaluate across three key scenarios: in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and combinatorial generalization. We developed a 2D simulation testbed for object movement and collisions to generate videos deterministically governed by one or more classical mechanics laws. This provides an unlimited supply of data for large-scale experimentation and enables quantitative evaluation of whether the generated videos adhere to physical laws. We trained diffusion-based video generation models to predict object movements based on initial frames. Our scaling experiments show perfect generalization within the distribution, measurable scaling behavior for combinatorial generalization, but failure in out-of-distribution scenarios. Further experiments reveal two key insights about the generalization mechanisms of these models: (1) the models fail to abstract general physical rules and instead exhibit "case-based" generalization behavior, i.e., mimicking the closest training example; (2) when generalizing to new cases, models are observed to prioritize different factors when referencing training data: color > size > velocity > shape. Our study suggests that scaling alone is insufficient for video generation models to uncover fundamental physical laws, despite its role in Sora's broader success.

Generating temporally-consistent high-fidelity videos can be computationally expensive, especially over longer temporal spans. More-recent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) -- despite making significant headway in this context -- have only heightened such challenges as they rely on larger models and heavier attention mechanisms, resulting in slower inference speeds. In this paper, we introduce a training-free method to accelerate video DiTs, termed Adaptive Caching (AdaCache), which is motivated by the fact that "not all videos are created equal": meaning, some videos require fewer denoising steps to attain a reasonable quality than others. Building on this, we not only cache computations through the diffusion process, but also devise a caching schedule tailored to each video generation, maximizing the quality-latency trade-off. We further introduce a Motion Regularization (MoReg) scheme to utilize video information within AdaCache, essentially controlling the compute allocation based on motion content. Altogether, our plug-and-play contributions grant significant inference speedups (e.g. up to 4.7x on Open-Sora 720p - 2s video generation) without sacrificing the generation quality, across multiple video DiT baselines.

Understanding and mitigating the potential risks associated with foundation models (FMs) hinges on developing effective interpretability methods. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for disentangling FM representations, but they struggle to capture rare, yet crucial concepts in the data. We introduce Specialized Sparse Autoencoders (SSAEs), designed to illuminate these elusive dark matter features by focusing on specific subdomains. We present a practical recipe for training SSAEs, demonstrating the efficacy of dense retrieval for data selection and the benefits of Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization as a training objective to improve concept recall. Our evaluation of SSAEs on standard metrics, such as downstream perplexity and L_0 sparsity, show that they effectively capture subdomain tail concepts, exceeding the capabilities of general-purpose SAEs. We showcase the practical utility of SSAEs in a case study on the Bias in Bios dataset, where SSAEs achieve a 12.5\% increase in worst-group classification accuracy when applied to remove spurious gender information. SSAEs provide a powerful new lens for peering into the inner workings of FMs in subdomains.
