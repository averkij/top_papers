Autonomous agents have become increasingly important for interacting with the real world. Android agents, in particular, have been recently a frequently-mentioned interaction method. However, existing studies for training and evaluating Android agents lack systematic research on both open-source and closed-source models. In this work, we propose AndroidLab as a systematic Android agent framework. It includes an operation environment with different modalities, action space, and a reproducible benchmark. It supports both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models (LMMs) in the same action space. AndroidLab benchmark includes predefined Android virtual devices and 138 tasks across nine apps built on these devices. By using the AndroidLab environment, we develop an Android Instruction dataset and train six open-source LLMs and LMMs, lifting the average success rates from 4.59% to 21.50% for LLMs and from 1.93% to 13.28% for LMMs. AndroidLab is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/Android-Lab.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential as autonomous agents, particularly in web-based tasks. However, existing LLM web agents heavily rely on expensive proprietary LLM APIs, while open LLMs lack the necessary decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces WebRL, a self-evolving online curriculum reinforcement learning framework designed to train high-performance web agents using open LLMs. WebRL addresses three key challenges in building LLM web agents, including the scarcity of training tasks, sparse feedback signals, and policy distribution drift in online learning. Specifically, WebRL incorporates 1) a self-evolving curriculum that generates new tasks from unsuccessful attempts, 2) a robust outcome-supervised reward model (ORM), and 3) adaptive reinforcement learning strategies to ensure consistent improvements. We apply WebRL to transform open Llama-3.1 and GLM-4 models into proficient web agents. On WebArena-Lite, WebRL improves the success rate of Llama-3.1-8B from 4.8% to 42.4%, and from 6.1% to 43% for GLM-4-9B. These open models significantly surpass the performance of GPT-4-Turbo (17.6%) and GPT-4o (13.9%) and outperform previous state-of-the-art web agents trained on open LLMs (AutoWebGLM, 18.2%). Our findings demonstrate WebRL's effectiveness in bridging the gap between open and proprietary LLM-based web agents, paving the way for more accessible and powerful autonomous web interaction systems.

Activation sparsity denotes the existence of substantial weakly-contributed elements within activation outputs that can be eliminated, benefiting many important applications concerned with large language models (LLMs). Although promoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies, existing works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation between activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and influential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only Transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-p% sparsity, a precise and performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any activation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important phenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable performance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio (i.e., 1-sparsity ratio) evolves as a convergent increasing power-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data for SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate that ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can leverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the activation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain bottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture at a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we surprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly with the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are insensitive to the parameter scale. These empirical laws towards LLMs with greater activation sparsity have important implications for making LLMs more efficient and interpretable.

Recent developments in 2D visual generation have been remarkably successful. However, 3D and 4D generation remain challenging in real-world applications due to the lack of large-scale 4D data and effective model design. In this paper, we propose to jointly investigate general 3D and 4D generation by leveraging camera and object movements commonly observed in daily life. Due to the lack of real-world 4D data in the community, we first propose a data curation pipeline to obtain camera poses and object motion strength from videos. Based on this pipeline, we introduce a large-scale real-world 4D scene dataset: CamVid-30K. By leveraging all the 3D and 4D data, we develop our framework, GenXD, which allows us to produce any 3D or 4D scene. We propose multiview-temporal modules, which disentangle camera and object movements, to seamlessly learn from both 3D and 4D data. Additionally, GenXD employs masked latent conditions to support a variety of conditioning views. GenXD can generate videos that follow the camera trajectory as well as consistent 3D views that can be lifted into 3D representations. We perform extensive evaluations across various real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating GenXD's effectiveness and versatility compared to previous methods in 3D and 4D generation.

"Recent developments in 2D visual generation have been remarkably successful. However, 3D and 4D generation remain challenging in real-world applications due to the lack of large-scale 4D data and effective model design. In this paper, we propose to jointly investigate general 3D and 4D generation by leveraging camera and object movements commonly observed in daily life. Due to the lack of real-world 4D data in the community, we first propose a data curation pipeline to obtain camera poses and object motion strength from videos. Based on this pipeline, we introduce a large-scale real-world 4D scene dataset: CamVid-30K. By leveraging all the 3D and 4D data, we develop our framework, GenXD, which allows us to produce any 3D or 4D scene. We propose multiview-temporal modules, which disentangle camera and object movements, to seamlessly learn from both 3D and 4D data. Additionally, GenXD employs masked latent conditions to support a variety of conditioning views. GenXD can generate videos that follow the camera trajectory as well as consistent 3D views that can be lifted into 3D representations. We perform extensive evaluations across various real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating GenXD's effectiveness and versatility compared to previous methods in 3D and 4D generation."

In this paper, we introduce Hunyuan-Large, which is currently the largest open-source Transformer-based mixture of experts model, with a total of 389 billion parameters and 52 billion activation parameters, capable of handling up to 256K tokens. We conduct a thorough evaluation of Hunyuan-Large's superior performance across various benchmarks including language understanding and generation, logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, coding, long-context, and aggregated tasks, where it outperforms LLama3.1-70B and exhibits comparable performance when compared to the significantly larger LLama3.1-405B model. Key practice of Hunyuan-Large include large-scale synthetic data that is orders larger than in previous literature, a mixed expert routing strategy, a key-value cache compression technique, and an expert-specific learning rate strategy. Additionally, we also investigate the scaling laws and learning rate schedule of mixture of experts models, providing valuable insights and guidances for future model development and optimization. The code and checkpoints of Hunyuan-Large are released to facilitate future innovations and applications.
