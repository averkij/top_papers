Many real-world user queries (e.g. "How do to make egg fried rice?") could benefit from systems capable of generating responses with both textual steps with accompanying images, similar to a cookbook. Models designed to generate interleaved text and images face challenges in ensuring consistency within and across these modalities. To address these challenges, we present ISG, a comprehensive evaluation framework for interleaved text-and-image generation. ISG leverages a scene graph structure to capture relationships between text and image blocks, evaluating responses on four levels of granularity: holistic, structural, block-level, and image-specific. This multi-tiered evaluation allows for a nuanced assessment of consistency, coherence, and accuracy, and provides interpretable question-answer feedback. In conjunction with ISG, we introduce a benchmark, ISG-Bench, encompassing 1,150 samples across 8 categories and 21 subcategories. This benchmark dataset includes complex language-vision dependencies and golden answers to evaluate models effectively on vision-centric tasks such as style transfer, a challenging area for current models. Using ISG-Bench, we demonstrate that recent unified vision-language models perform poorly on generating interleaved content. While compositional approaches that combine separate language and image models show a 111% improvement over unified models at the holistic level, their performance remains suboptimal at both block and image levels. To facilitate future work, we develop ISG-Agent, a baseline agent employing a "plan-execute-refine" pipeline to invoke tools, achieving a 122% performance improvement.

Speculative Decoding (SD) has become an important technique in accelerating the inference speed of large language models. Conventional SD methods employ a fixed draft length, which ignores the token generation difficulty across tasks. Consequently, in this paper, we address such an issue and introduce SVIP - a difficulty-aware dynamic draft length policy for speculative decoding systems. Based on a theoretical lower bound of draft token acceptance rate and its inference-time approximation, SVIP adaptively determines the lengths of draft sequences based on the entropy of each draft token distribution. Experimental results on mainstream SD benchmarks and frameworks demonstrate the superior performance of SVIP, achieving up to 20\% walltime speedup on SpecBench over baseline SD methods and 60\% speedup on MT-Bench for long-form generation of up to 8K tokens. Moreover, SVIP is totally training-free and compatible with any existing SD methods that generate draft tokens autoregressively. Experimental results also show that SVIP yields consistent walltime improvement on top of GliDe & CaPE and EAGLE-2.

In the rapidly advancing field of image generation, Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling has garnered considerable attention for its innovative next-scale prediction approach. This paradigm offers substantial improvements in efficiency, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. Yet, the inherently coarse-to-fine nature of VAR introduces a prolonged token sequence, leading to prohibitive memory consumption and computational redundancies. To address these bottlenecks, we propose Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel efficient decoding strategy tailored for the VAR framework. CoDe capitalizes on two critical observations: the substantially reduced parameter demands at larger scales and the exclusive generation patterns across different scales. Based on these insights, we partition the multi-scale inference process into a seamless collaboration between a large model and a small model. The large model serves as the 'drafter', specializing in generating low-frequency content at smaller scales, while the smaller model serves as the 'refiner', solely focusing on predicting high-frequency details at larger scales. This collaboration yields remarkable efficiency with minimal impact on quality: CoDe achieves a 1.7x speedup, slashes memory usage by around 50%, and preserves image quality with only a negligible FID increase from 1.95 to 1.98. When drafting steps are further decreased, CoDe can achieve an impressive 2.9x acceleration ratio, reaching 41 images/s at 256x256 resolution on a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU, while preserving a commendable FID of 2.27.

"In the rapidly advancing field of image generation, Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling has garnered considerable attention for its innovative next-scale prediction approach. This paradigm offers substantial improvements in efficiency, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. Yet, the inherently coarse-to-fine nature of VAR introduces a prolonged token sequence, leading to prohibitive memory consumption and computational redundancies. To address these bottlenecks, we propose Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel efficient decoding strategy tailored for the VAR framework. CoDe capitalizes on two critical observations: the substantially reduced parameter demands at larger scales and the exclusive generation patterns across different scales. Based on these insights, we partition the multi-scale inference process into a seamless collaboration between a large model and a small model. The large model serves as the 'drafter', specializing in generating low-frequency content at smaller scales, while the smaller model serves as the 'refiner', solely focusing on predicting high-frequency details at larger scales. This collaboration yields remarkable efficiency with minimal impact on quality: CoDe achieves a 1.7x speedup, slashes memory usage by around 50%, and preserves image quality with only a negligible FID increase from 1.95 to 1.98. When drafting steps are further decreased, CoDe can achieve an impressive 2.9x acceleration ratio, reaching 41 images/s at 256x256 resolution on a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU, while preserving a commendable FID of 2.27. The code is available at https://github.com/czg1225/CoDe"

Recently, the diffusion model has emerged as a powerful generative technique for robotic policy learning, capable of modeling multi-mode action distributions. Leveraging its capability for end-to-end autonomous driving is a promising direction. However, the numerous denoising steps in the robotic diffusion policy and the more dynamic, open-world nature of traffic scenes pose substantial challenges for generating diverse driving actions at a real-time speed. To address these challenges, we propose a novel truncated diffusion policy that incorporates prior multi-mode anchors and truncates the diffusion schedule, enabling the model to learn denoising from anchored Gaussian distribution to the multi-mode driving action distribution. Additionally, we design an efficient cascade diffusion decoder for enhanced interaction with conditional scene context. The proposed model, DiffusionDrive, demonstrates 10times reduction in denoising steps compared to vanilla diffusion policy, delivering superior diversity and quality in just 2 steps. On the planning-oriented NAVSIM dataset, with the aligned ResNet-34 backbone, DiffusionDrive achieves 88.1 PDMS without bells and whistles, setting a new record, while running at a real-time speed of 45 FPS on an NVIDIA 4090. Qualitative results on challenging scenarios further confirm that DiffusionDrive can robustly generate diverse plausible driving actions.
