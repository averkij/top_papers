Traditionally, automating GUI interactions relied on script-based or rule-based approaches, which, while effective for fixed workflows, lacked the flexibility and adaptability required for dynamic, real-world applications. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly multimodal models, has ushered in new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, task generalization, and visual processing. This has paved the way for new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry. To provide structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address critical research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action models tailored for GUI tasks, and the ev"

Text:"4 2 0 2 7 2 ] . [ 1 3 6 3 8 1 . 1 1 4 2 : r ChatRex: Taming Multimodal LLM for Joint Perception and Understanding Qing Jiang Gen Luo Yuqin Yang Yuda Xiong Yihao Chen Zhaoyang Zeng Tianhe Ren Lei Zhang International Digital Economy Academy (IDEA) Abstract Perception and understanding are two pillars of computer vision. While multimodal large language models (MLLM) have demonstrated remarkable visual understanding capabilities, they arguably lack accurate perception abilities, e.g. the stage-of-the-art model Qwen2-VL only achieves 43.9 recall rate on the COCO dataset, limiting many tasks requiring the combination of perception and understanding. In this work, we aim to bridge this perception gap from both model designing and data development perspectives. We first introduce ChatRex, an MLLM with decoupled perception design. Instead of having the LLM directly predict box coordinates, we feed the output boxes from universal proposal network into the LLM, allowing it to output the corresponding box indices to represent its detection results, turning the regression task into retrievalbased task that LLM handles more proficiently. From the data perspective, we build fully automated data engine and construct the Rexverse-2M dataset which possesses multiple granularities to support the joint training of perception and understanding. After standard two-stage training, ChatRex demonstrates strong perception capabilities while preserving multimodal understanding performance. The combination of these two capabilities simultaneously unlocks many attractive applications, demonstrating the complementary roles of both perception and understanding in MLLM. Code is available at https://github.com/IDEA-Research/ChatRex. Perception and understanding are two fundamental human faculties within behavioral science. Humans initially perceive objects, with vision signals transmitted to the brain for understanding, and can then locate back to the objects during conversation. In pursuit of AGI,"

"GUIs have long been central to human-computer interaction, providing an intuitive and visually-driven way to access and interact with digital systems. The advent of LLMs, particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and visual processing. This has paved the way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.   To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks necessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging applications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey identifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in the field. By consolidating foundational knowledge and state-of-the-art developments, this work aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in overcoming challenges and unlocking the full potential of LLM-brained GUI agents."

Perception and understanding are two pillars of computer vision. While multimodal large language models (MLLM) have demonstrated remarkable visual understanding capabilities, they arguably lack accurate perception abilities, e.g. the stage-of-the-art model Qwen2-VL only achieves a 43.9 recall rate on the COCO dataset, limiting many tasks requiring the combination of perception and understanding. In this work, we aim to bridge this perception gap from both model designing and data development perspectives. We first introduce ChatRex, an MLLM with a decoupled perception design. Instead of having the LLM directly predict box coordinates, we feed the output boxes from a universal proposal network into the LLM, allowing it to output the corresponding box indices to represent its detection results, turning the regression task into a retrieval-based task that LLM handles more proficiently. From the data perspective, we build a fully automated data engine and construct the Rexverse-2M dataset which possesses multiple granularities to support the joint training of perception and understanding. After standard two-stage training, ChatRex demonstrates strong perception capabilities while preserving multimodal understanding performance. The combination of these two capabilities simultaneously unlocks many attractive applications, demonstrating the complementary roles of both perception and understanding in MLLM.
