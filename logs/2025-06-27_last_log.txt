Text:"MADrive: Memory-Augmented Driving Scene Modeling POLINA KARPIKOVA, Yandex DANIIL SELIKHANOVYCH, Yandex Research, HSE University, Skoltech KIRILL STRUMINSKY, Yandex Research, HSE University RUSLAN MUSAEV, Yandex, Skoltech MARIA GOLITSYNA, Yandex DMITRY BARANCHUK, Yandex Research 5 2 0 2 6 2 ] . [ 1 0 2 5 1 2 . 6 0 5 2 : r Fig. 1. MADrive reconstructs 3D driving scene from training frames (Left) and replaces partially observed vehicles in the scene with realistically reconstructed counterparts retrieved from MAD-Cars, our novel multi-view auto dataset. MADrive enables high-fidelity modeling of future scene views (Middle-left vs. Middle-right) and supports simulation of alternative scenarios, advancing novel-view synthesis in dynamic environments (Right). Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting. However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with visually similar 3D assets retrieved from large-scale external memory bank. Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, curated dataset of 70K 360 car videos captured in the wild and present retrieval module that finds the most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding 3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as demonstrated in our experiments.

[ 2 9 2 7 8 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r aWe propose MuseControlLite, lightweight mechanism designed to fine-tune text-to-music generation models for precise conditioning using various time-varying musical attributes and reference audio signals. The key finding is that positional embeddings, which have been seldom used by text-to-music generation models in the conditioner for text conditions, are critical when the condition of interest is function of time. Using melody control as an example, our experiments show that simply adding rotary positional embeddings to the decoupled cross-attention layers increases control accuracy from 56.6% to 61.1%, while requiring 6.75 times fewer trainable parameters than state-of-the-art fine-tuning mechanisms, using the same pre-trained diffusion Transformer model of Stable Audio Open. We evaluate various forms of musical attribute control, audio inpainting, and audio outpainting, demonstrating improved controllability over MusicGen-Large and Stable Audio Open ControlNet at significantly lower fine-tuning cost, with only 85M trainable parameters. Source code, model checkpoints, and demo examples are available at: https: //MuseControlLite.github.io/web/. 1. Introduction Text-to-music generation models have recently gained popularity as they hold the promise of empowering everyone to create high-quality and expressive music without much musical training and reduced time cost (Copet et al., 2024). However, for people who desire to be more deeply involved in the creation process itself rather than the final output only, 1National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. 2Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States. Correspondence to: Fang-Duo Tsai <fundwotsai2001@gmail.com>. Proceedings of the 42 nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada. PMLR 267, 2025. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). mechanisms to exert controllability going beyond the simple text prompt have been considered critical. As such, recent months have seen an increasing body of research concerning the addition of fine-grained, time-varying control to text-tomusic generation, such as those related to musical aspects of chords, rhythm, melody, and dynamics. Exemplars include Music ControlNet (Wu et al., 2024), MusiConGen (Lan et al., 2024), JASCO (Tal et al., 2024), and DITTO (Novack et al., 2024b), to name just few. Despite the exciting progress that has been made, we find two avenues for improvement. First, existing models might be over-parameterized. In view of the success of ControlNet (Zhang et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024) in adding spatial control for text-to-image generation, prominent approach has been to use similar idea to fine-tune pre-trained text-to-music models to add conditioners for time-varying conditions. For example, treating mel-spectrograms as images, Music ControlNet (Wu et al., 2024) offers multiple conditions of melody, rhythm and dynamics. Stable Audio Open ControlNet (Hou et al., 2025) further improves audio quality with latent diffusion, adapting the original U-Net-based ControlNet encoder to diffusion Transformer architecture (Peebles & Xie, 2023). However, the ControlNet approach requires duplicating half of the diffusion model as trainable copy (Zhang et al., 2023), leading to increased training and inference times. Lighter alternatives for fine-tuning, such as the idea of decoupled cross-attention presented in IP-adapter (Ye et al., 2023), can be studied. Second, while fine-tuning text-to-music generation model to consider conditions of musical attributes or conditions of reference audio signals (Tsai et al., 2024) have been studied separately, little work has been done to consider both types of conditions at the same time. This capability may enable various creative use cases, such as adding melody conditions while performing audio inpainting or outpainting. We propose MuseControlLite, lightweight fine-tuning mechanism with significantly fewer trainable parameters for controllable text-to-music generation. The key finding is that the decoupled cross-attention mechanism (Ye et al., 2023), when augmented with positional embeddings, achieves superior performance while using nearly an order MuseControlLite: Multifunctional Music Generation with Lightweight Conditioners of magnitude fewer trainable parameters than ControlNetbased mechanisms (85M vs. 572M). Built on the simple idea of combining the rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) (Su et al., 2024) with decoupled cross-attention, MuseControlLite is novel framework for controlling time-varying conditions. Our implementation introduces only an additional 8% trainable parameters relative to the diffusion Transformer backbone (Evans et al., 2024c). Unlike our approach, ControlNet-based models (Wu et al., 2024; Hou et al., 2025) incorporate positional embeddings in the self-attention layers of the Transformer blocks. These models process the conditioning input in the latent spacematching the shape of the pre-trained backboneand reintroduce it into the frozen U-Net decoder (Wu et al., 2024) or Transformer blocks (Hou et al., 2025) to guide the generation toward the desired output. We find empirically that our approach is more parameter-efficient. Our model supports multi-attribute control similarly to Music ControlNet (Wu et al., 2024). Moreover, by introducing audio conditioning, MuseControlLite is able to replicate the reference audio in full resolution while providing partial control capability, enabling both audio inpainting and outpainting. Additionally, we adopt multiple classifier-free guidance (Liu et al., 2022; Brooks et al., 2023) to flexibly regulate the strength of the time-varying conditions, preventing the quality degradation that can result from over-fixation. The main contributions are three-fold: The first investigation of using positional embeddings for decoupled cross-attention layers in diffusion Transformers for controllable text-to-music generation. The first fine-tuning method that handles both attribute and audio control (text+attribute+audio). In contrast, existing finetuning methods only take either attribute control (text+attribute) (Wu et al., 2024), or audio control (text+audio) (Tsai et al., 2024).

This work introduces MADrive, a memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank. Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of {sim}70K 360{\deg} car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding 3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as demonstrated in our experiments.

A novel conditional computation architecture for Transformers dynamically skips middle layers based on input and a gating mechanism, but does not outperform dense baselines in reducing computational cost or improving validation performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g., mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another. However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions. Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

Rotary positional embeddings enhance time-varying control in text-to-music generation models with fewer parameters.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose MuseControlLite, a lightweight mechanism designed to fine-tune text-to-music generation models for precise conditioning using various time-varying musical attributes and reference audio signals. The key finding is that positional embeddings, which have been seldom used by text-to-music generation models in the conditioner for text conditions, are critical when the condition of interest is a function of time. Using melody control as an example, our experiments show that simply adding rotary positional embeddings to the decoupled cross-attention layers increases control accuracy from 56.6% to 61.1%, while requiring 6.75 times fewer trainable parameters than state-of-the-art fine-tuning mechanisms, using the same pre-trained diffusion Transformer model of Stable Audio Open. We evaluate various forms of musical attribute control, audio inpainting, and audio outpainting, demonstrating improved controllability over MusicGen-Large and Stable Audio Open ControlNet at a significantly lower fine-tuning cost, with only 85M trainble parameters.
