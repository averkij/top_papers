Text:"Preprint. Under review. FineWeb2: One Pipeline to Scale Them All Adapting Pre-Training Data Processing to Every Language Guilherme Penedo Hynek Kydlıˇcek Negar Foroutan Leandro Von WerraVinko Sabolˇcec5 2 0 2 6 2 ] . [ 1 0 2 9 0 2 . 6 0 5 2 : r aPipeline code: https://github.com/huggingface/fineweb-2 FineWeb2 dataset: https://hf.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains challenge, in large part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication pipelines to large number of languages. In this work, we introduce new pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb (Penedo et al., 2024) that can be automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our pipeline design choices on set of nine diverse languages, guided by set of meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through novel selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our pipeline can be used to create nonEnglish corpora that produce more performant models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce straightforward and principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift. Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, new 20 terabyte (5 billion document) multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and evaluation codebases.One of the main drivers of the improving capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is increased scale, in terms of both model and pre-training dataset size. To satiate the ever-growing hunger for text data, most pretraining datasets include large amounts of text scraped from the public internet (Raffel et al., 2020; Penedo et al., 2023; 2024). Consequently, pre-training data tends to be most readily available in the high-resource languages (English, Chinese, etc.) that are most prevalent on the internet. Since LLM capabilities largely stem from the data they were trained on (Grosse et al., 2023; Roberts et al., 2020; Razeghi et al., 2022), this has resulted in language models having better performance on high-resource languages. Furthermore, commercial and open language model development frequently only targets these languages (Grattafiori et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024; 01.AI et al., 2025). This state of affairs leaves the majority of the worlds population Figure 1: The FineWeb2 pipeline: Evaluation results of models trained on 350 billion tokens show that each pipeline step Language Identification (LID), Deduplication (Dedup), Filtering, and Dedup-informed upsampling (Rehydration) improves performance. Correspondence to guilherme at huggingface dot co 1 Preprint. Under review. (speaking over 7,000 languages (Eberhard et al., 2024)) unable to interact with state-of-the-art LLMs in their native tongue. Why not just curate datasets in underrepresented languages and train LLMs on them? Putting aside the possible lack of data (recent LLM training runs typically require trillions of tokens (AI@Meta, 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024)), key challenge is that high-resource languages benefit from the existence of well-tuned and battle-tested data processing and curation pipelines, whereas low-resource languages face vastly different landscape: evaluating corpora quality, ensuring accurate language identification, customizing filtering recipes, and even separating words can be major challenges for many languages. While some past work has successfully curated single-language pre-training datasets and used them to produce strong language-specific models (Carmo et al., 2020; de Vries et al., 2019; Le et al., 2020; Martin et al., 2020; Delobelle et al., 2020; Luukkonen et al., 2023; PLLuM Consortium, 2025; Pipatanakul et al., 2023, etc.), hand-designing different pipeline for each language does not scale. Consequently, most past work on multilingual datasets (e.g. Xue et al., 2021; Wenzek et al., 2020; De Gibert et al., 2024) has used (mostly) fixed pipeline across all languages. This one-size-fits-all approach risks applying inappropriate filtering to different languages, obviating the goal of creating performant data in many languages. In this work, we introduce new data processing pipeline based on the approach used for the state-of-the-art English pre-training dataset FineWeb (Penedo et al., 2024). Importantly, our pipeline can be automatically adapted based on language-specific statistics to produce high-quality pre-training corpora in any language. We follow data-driven approach and validate our design choices by running extensive ablation experiments where we train monolingual models on set of nine diverse languages and evaluate on tasks chosen through novel selection process based on measurable criteria that ensure meaningful signal. In addition, we introduce straightforward and principled approach to rebalance datasets using the original duplication counts and quality signals that allows globally neardeduplicated datasets to obtain performance uplift. Ultimately, we show that models trained on language-specific corpora produced by our pipeline perform better than those trained on other public web-based multilingual datasets by training models on additional unseen languages that were not used to inform pipeline design decisions. Finally, we use our pipeline to process almost 100 Common Crawl1 snapshots spanning the summer of 2013 to April 2024 to create FineWeb2, new 20 terabyte (5 billion document) dataset covering over 1000 languages. FineWeb2 is released under the permissive ODC-By License, and we additionally release the pipeline, training, and evaluation codebases, as well as the preliminary version of the dataset obtained after the deduplication stage, to facilitate further research on multilingual pre-training dataset curation.Before detailing our dataset creation process, we first establish critical considerations that arise when dealing with massively multilingual data. Notation When considering thousands of languages, its important to have an unambiguous way of referring to languages and scripts. In our work we identify languages by their official IS"

A new pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb supports multilingual LLMs by automatically adapting to any language, improving model performance and balancing dataset quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift. Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document) multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and evaluation codebases.
