[ 1 9 3 5 1 2 . 6 0 5 2 : r WorldVLA: Towards Autoregressive Action World Model Jun Cen1,2,3, Chaohui Yu1, Hangjie Yuan1,2,3, Yuming Jiang1, Siteng Huang1,2, Jiayan Guo1, Xin Li1,2, Yibing Song1, Hao Luo1,2, Fan Wang1, Deli Zhao1,2, Hao Chen3 1DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group 2Hupan Lab 3Zhejiang University We present WorldVLA, an autoregressive action world model that unifies action and image understanding and generation. Our WorldVLA intergrates Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and world model in one single framework. The world model predicts future images by leveraging both action and image understanding, with the purpose of learning the underlying physics of the environment to improve action generation. Meanwhile, the action model generates the subsequent actions based on image observations, aiding in visual understanding and in turn helps visual generation of the world model. We demonstrate that WorldVLA outperforms standalone action and world models, highlighting the mutual enhancement between the world model and the action model. In addition, we find that the performance of the action model deteriorates when generating sequences of actions in an autoregressive manner. This phenomenon can be attributed to the models limited generalization capability for action prediction, leading to the propagation of errors from earlier actions to subsequent ones. To address this issue, we propose an attention mask strategy that selectively masks prior actions during the generation of the current action, which shows significant performance improvement in the action chunk generation task.

This is largely due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by large language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs: free-text clinical descriptions, structured Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms, and genetic testing results in variant call format (VCF). The system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each accompanied by transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence. This interpretability is critical for clinical adoption, supporting human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. DeepRare comprises three key components: central host with long-term memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific analytical tasks (e.g., phenotype extraction, variant prioritization) integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale, up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current clinical information.

"DeepRare, a large language model-based system, provides accurate rare disease diagnoses using heterogeneous clinical inputs and outperforms other diagnostic methods across various datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.   DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale, up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013 diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15 methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79 percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore, the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application http://raredx.cn/doctor."
