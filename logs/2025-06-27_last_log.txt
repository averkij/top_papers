Text:"DiLoCoX: Low-Communication Large-Scale Training Framework for Decentralized Cluster Ji Qi 1 WenPeng Zhu 1 Li Li 1 Ming Wu 2 YingJun Wu 1 Wu He 1 Xun Gao 1 Jason Zeng 2 Michael HeinrichThe distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), demands high level of communication. Consequently, it is highly dependent on centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects. Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, low-communication large-scale decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with Dual Optimizer Policy, OneStep-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-stepdelay overlap of communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression scheme, through theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training 107B foundation model over 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve 357x speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100 billion parameters. 5 2 0 2 6 2 ] . [ 1 3 6 2 1 2 . 6 0 5 2 : r 1. Introduction LLMs have quickly become dominant in the field of AI due to their exceptional capabilities. Their effectiveness in areas such as automated dialogue generation, machine translation, content summarization, and recommendation systems clearly demonstrates their superior advantages (Zhao et al., 1China Mobile(Suzhou) Software Technology, JiangSu, Ji Qi Correspondence to: China 2Zero Gravity Labs. <qiji@cmss.chinamobile.com>. 2023a; Wang et al., 2022; Bommasani et al., 2021). However, as efforts to improve the accuracy of these models continue, both their complexity and scale have grown exponentially. In recent years, the number of parameters has increased from billions (Devlin, 2018) to trillions (Fedus et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022), introducing significant challenges in model training. For example, pre-training model with 175B (Brown, 2020) parameters can require 12,000 GPUs operating for 118 days (Narayanan et al., 2021). In distributed foundation model training, communication is the key bottleneck. As an example, fine-tuning GPT-J-6B over 10B tokens with 262K batch size across 4 machines (2 A100 GPUs each) demands 915.5 TB data communication in total training(Wang et al., 2023). As result, the highspeed centralized cluster is currently the dominant solution for training foundation model(Rendle et al., 2016). Decentralized clusters usually have significant amount of computing resources than centralized cluster, but the bandwidth between clusters is relatively slower, with only hundreds of Mbps to 1 Gbps in common. When using training framework such as Megatron-LM(Shoeybi et al., 2019) for distributed cluster training, the bandwidth between clusters often becomes training bottleneck(Dai et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2022), resulting in the inability to fully utilize the computing resources of decentralized clusters for model training. Recently, there has been an exciting collection of work focusing on the decentralized training of foundation models. By introducing outer Nesterov momentum optimizers, DiLoCo (Douillard et al., 2023) can train model with up to 400M parameters using only data parallelism and achieve even better performance than fully synchronous model. OpenDiLoCo(Jaghouar et al., 2024) is an opensource implementation of DiLoCo. With FP16 gradient compression and Hivemind optimized collective communication operators, it can train the 1.1B model over poorly connected networks with bandwidth of hundreds of Mbps and negligible degradation in convergence. CocktailSGD (Wang et al., 2023) combines three distinct compression techniques, achieving 117 aggressive compression in finetuning LLMs with up to 20B parameters over 500Mbps network. 1 DiLoCoX: Low-Communication Large-Scale Training Framework for Decentralized Cluster However, despite these recent efforts, the scale of model parameters and communication bottleneck is still challenge when pretraining over 100B parameter models. DiLoCo and OpenDiLoCo (Douillard et al., 2023; Jaghouar et al., 2024) have comparable model convergence with the fully synchronous model. However, they only use data parallelism and do not support FSDP (Zhao et al., 2023b) or deepspeed (Rajbhandari et al., 2020), thus the VRAM of GPU capacity limits the scale of model parameters. Furthermore, DiLoCo and OpenDiloCo (Douillard et al., 2023; Jaghouar et al., 2024) employ pseudo-gradients synchronous mechanism. During the synchronization of pseudo-gradients, local training is in an idle state. When the model scale is large and network bandwidth is limited, the idle time for synchronizing pseudo-gradients becomes unacceptable. CocktailSGD (Wang et al., 2023) uses pipeline parallelism to support 20B model training, but the compression ratio of data parallelism is aggressive up to 117 times and does not use local training like DiLoCo or OpenDiLoCo in decentralized clusters, which has potential impact on model convergence. In order to train models with scale of more than 100B parameters on low-bandwidth decentralized clusters while having comparative model convergence, we have identified the following key challenges: 1. Introduce model parallelism to address the limitation of VRAM which has to accommodate the whole model parameters. 2. The overlap between the synchronization of pseudo-gradients and local training to avoid the idleness of computing resources. 3. Design an efficient gradient compression algorithm and balance it with the number of local training steps to ensure the convergence of model training. To address the above challenges, we propose low communication large-scale model training framework DiLoCoX for decentralized cluster. Experiments demonstrate that DiLoCoX can pre-train 107B model and significantly hide communication overhead while ensuring model convergence on decentralized clusters with only 1Gbps network bandwidth. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the largest-sc"

DiLoCoX, a decentralized cluster training framework, enhances the training of large-scale models over slow networks by utilizing pipeline parallelism, dual optimizer policy, and gradient compression, achieving significant speed improvements and effective scalability.  					AI-generated summary 				 The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects. Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100 billion parameters.
