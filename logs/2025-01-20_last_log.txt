Text:"HIFI-SR: UNIFIED GENERATIVE TRANSFORMER-CONVOLUTIONAL ADVERSARIAL NETWORK FOR HIGH-FIDELITY SPEECH SUPER-RESOLUTION Tongyi Lab, Alibaba Group, Singapore {shengkui.zhao, b.ma}@alibaba-inc.com 5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 5 4 0 0 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r ABSTRACT The application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) has recently advanced speech super-resolution (SR) based on intermediate representations like mel-spectrograms. However, existing SR methods that typically rely on independently trained and concatenated networks may lead to inconsistent representations and poor speech quality, especially in out-of-domain scenarios. In this work, we propose HiFi-SR, unified network that leverages end-to-end adversarial training to achieve high-fidelity speech super-resolution. Our model features unified transformer-convolutional generator designed to seamlessly handle both the prediction of latent representations and their conversion into time-domain waveforms. The transformer network serves as powerful encoder, converting lowresolution mel-spectrograms into latent space representations, while the convolutional network upscales these representations into highresolution waveforms. To enhance high-frequency fidelity, we incorporate multi-band, multi-scale time-frequency discriminator, along with multi-scale mel-reconstruction loss in the adversarial training process. HiFi-SR is versatile, capable of upscaling any input speech signal between 4 kHz and 32 kHz to 48 kHz sampling rate. Experimental results demonstrate that HiFi-SR significantly outperforms existing speech SR methods across both objective metrics and ABX preference tests, for both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Index Terms speech super-resolution, generative adversarial networks, transformer, neural vocoder 1. INTRODUCTION Speech super-resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution speech signal from low-resolution input that retains only portion of the original samples.

The 2D cartoon style is a prominent art form in digital character creation, particularly popular among younger audiences. While advancements in digital human technology have spurred extensive research into photorealistic digital humans and 3D characters, interactive 2D cartoon characters have received comparatively less attention. Unlike 3D counterparts, which require sophisticated construction and resource-intensive rendering, Live2D, a widely-used format for 2D cartoon characters, offers a more efficient alternative, which allows to animate 2D characters in a manner that simulates 3D movement without the necessity of building a complete 3D model. Furthermore, Live2D employs lightweight HTML5 (H5) rendering, improving both accessibility and efficiency. In this technical report, we introduce Textoon, an innovative method for generating diverse 2D cartoon characters in the Live2D format based on text descriptions. The Textoon leverages cutting-edge language and vision models to comprehend textual intentions and generate 2D appearance, capable of creating a wide variety of stunning and interactive 2D characters within one minute.

"The application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) has recently advanced speech super-resolution (SR) based on intermediate representations like mel-spectrograms. However, existing SR methods that typically rely on independently trained and concatenated networks may lead to inconsistent representations and poor speech quality, especially in out-of-domain scenarios. In this work, we propose HiFi-SR, a unified network that leverages end-to-end adversarial training to achieve high-fidelity speech super-resolution. Our model features a unified transformer-convolutional generator designed to seamlessly handle both the prediction of latent representations and their conversion into time-domain waveforms. The transformer network serves as a powerful encoder, converting low-resolution mel-spectrograms into latent space representations, while the convolutional network upscales these representations into high-resolution waveforms. To enhance high-frequency fidelity, we incorporate a multi-band, multi-scale time-frequency discriminator, along with a multi-scale mel-reconstruction loss in the adversarial training process. HiFi-SR is versatile, capable of upscaling any input speech signal between 4 kHz and 32 kHz to a 48 kHz sampling rate. Experimental results demonstrate that HiFi-SR significantly outperforms existing speech SR methods across both objective metrics and ABX preference tests, for both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios (https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio)."

We introduce GaussianAvatar-Editor, an innovative framework for text-driven editing of animatable Gaussian head avatars that can be fully controlled in expression, pose, and viewpoint. Unlike static 3D Gaussian editing, editing animatable 4D Gaussian avatars presents challenges related to motion occlusion and spatial-temporal inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose the Weighted Alpha Blending Equation (WABE). This function enhances the blending weight of visible Gaussians while suppressing the influence on non-visible Gaussians, effectively handling motion occlusion during editing. Furthermore, to improve editing quality and ensure 4D consistency, we incorporate conditional adversarial learning into the editing process. This strategy helps to refine the edited results and maintain consistency throughout the animation. By integrating these methods, our GaussianAvatar-Editor achieves photorealistic and consistent results in animatable 4D Gaussian editing. We conduct comprehensive experiments across various subjects to validate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques, which demonstrates the superiority of our approach over existing methods. More results and code are available at: [Project Link](https://xiangyueliu.github.io/GaussianAvatar-Editor/).
