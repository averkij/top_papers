Introduction How can large language model (LLM) be guided to think deeper about complex problem and leverage inference time compute to improve its problem solving ability? Prior research has investigated various strategies for leveraging inference time compute, such as chain-of-thought [41, 21], self-consistency [39], sequential revision based on feedback [36, 30, 8, 19, 1], and search guided by auxiliary verifiers or evaluators [43]. When solution evaluator is available, search strategies have an advantage of being able to reliably improve problem solving ability with increased compute. For example, methods such as Bestof-N [4, 24, 25] and tree search [37] naturally exploit additional compute to explore larger set of solution candidates, thereby increasing the probability of finding successful solution. To better exploit inference time compute, we propose an evolutionary search strategy for LLMs that combines free-flowing stochastic exploration with large-scale iterative refinement. We"

We introduce PaSa, an advanced Paper Search agent powered by large language models. PaSa can autonomously make a series of decisions, including invoking search tools, reading papers, and selecting relevant references, to ultimately obtain comprehensive and accurate results for complex scholarly queries. We optimize PaSa using reinforcement learning with a synthetic dataset, AutoScholarQuery, which includes 35k fine-grained academic queries and corresponding papers sourced from top-tier AI conference publications. Additionally, we develop RealScholarQuery, a benchmark collecting real-world academic queries to assess PaSa performance in more realistic scenarios. Despite being trained on synthetic data, PaSa significantly outperforms existing baselines on RealScholarQuery, including Google, Google Scholar, Google with GPT-4 for paraphrased queries, chatGPT (search-enabled GPT-4o), GPT-o1, and PaSa-GPT-4o (PaSa implemented by prompting GPT-4o). Notably, PaSa-7B surpasses the best Google-based baseline, Google with GPT-4o, by 37.78% in recall@20 and 39.90% in recall@50. It also exceeds PaSa-GPT-4o by 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision.
