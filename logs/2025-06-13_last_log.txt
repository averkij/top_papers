Text:"Domain2Vec: Vectorizing Datasets to Find the Optimal Data Mixture without Training Mozhi Zhang 1 Howe Tissue (cid:66) Lu Wang 2 Xipeng QiuWe introduce DOMAIN2VEC, novel approach that decomposes any dataset into linear combination of several meta-domains, new concept designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets. DOMAIN2VEC maintains vocabulary of meta-domains and uses classifier to decompose any given dataset into domain vector that corresponds to distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining in training-free manner under the Distribution Alignment Assumption (DA2), which suggests that when the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better aligned, lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, DOMAIN2VEC can be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DOMAIN2VEC helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically, DOMAIN2VEC achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only 51.5% of the computation required when training on the original mixture of The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, DOMAIN2VEC improves downstream performance by an average of 2.83%. 5 2 0 2 2 1 ] . [ 1 2 5 9 0 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r 1. Introduction Through training on large-scale text corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities (Touvron et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2024; 1School of Computer Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China 2Ritzz-AI. Correspondence to: Howe Tissue (project lead) <h-sun20@tsinghua.org.cn>. Proceedings of the 42 nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada. PMLR 267, 2025. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 Qwen Team, 2024; DeepSeek-AI, 2024). The training datasets for LLMs are typically composed of multiple domains from diverse sources. Recent research has shown that the mixture proportions of these domains referred to as the data mixture, can significantly influence the effectiveness of LMs (Hoffmann et al., 2022b; Xie et al., 2023b), with data from one domain potentially affecting the performance on others (Guo et al., 2022). Typically, the data mixtures used for training LLMs are determined heuristically or based on downstream performance metrics. However, these methods lack scalability and often yield suboptimal data mixtures. Thus, identifying the optimal data mixture in scalable and efficient manner remains critical and challenging research question. Recently, researchers have proposed various methods to determine the optimal data mixture. The first line of prior works implicitly adjusts the data mixture by selecting highquality data from different domains or datasets (Lin et al., 2024; Ankner et al., 2024; Thakkar et al., 2023). The second line of work focuses on modeling the relationship between the data mixture and the performance of LLMs, and explicitly adjusts the data mixture across different datasets (Rae et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2023a; Sagawa* et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2024; Ge et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2024a; Que et al., 2024). While prior work has shown promising results, there are some key issues: 1) Computational Efficiency: For example, although the proxy model in DoReMi (Xie et al., 2023a) has only 280M parameters, its estimated FLOPs are high to 3.71019 for calculating on only 22 datasets. Moreover, The computational complexity of these methods will grow non-linearly as the number of datasets increases. 2) Lack of Scalability: After establishing the functional relationship between data mixtures and model performance (Ye et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024), if the dataset composition changes (e.g., by adding new datasets or filtering low-quality data, etc), previously fitted functions cannot be directly applied. This requires resampling new data mixtures, retraining proxy models, and refitting the functions, severely limiting the scalability of these methods. To address these issues, we introduce DOMAIN2VEC, novel framework designed to vectorize datasets. This enables us to perform all operations for computing optimal Domain2Vec: Vectorizing Datasets to Find the Optimal Data Mixture without Training mixing ratios in domain vector space, which has broad applicability when datasets change. Specifically, DOMAIN2VEC maintains vocabulary of meta-domains, and we hypothesize that any dataset can be approximated as linear combination of several meta-domains with specific distribution. This distribution could serve as the vector representation (domain vector) of given dataset. (1 n), where Key Assumption. DOMAIN2VEC maintains vocabulary, set of meta-domains. Assume we have meta-domains is represented as ej, one-hot vector where only the j-th element is 1. We hypothesize that, for any given dataset D, it could be represented as domain vector through linear combination of these meta-domains. Specifically, To efficiently identify the meta-domain composition of any given dataset, we propose to use meta-domain classifier to generate the corresponding domain vector. Building upon DOMAIN2VEC, we introduce the Distribution Alignment Assumption (DA2) to find optimal data mixtures for LM pretraining. DA2 states that lower validation loss can be achieved when the domain vector of the training dataset better aligns with the domain vector of the validation dataset. Based on DA2, we can easily find the optimal data mixture without training. Moreover, DOMAIN2VEC can be seamlessly integrated into prior works like RegMix (Liu et al., 2024). Unlike previous methods that model the relationship between data mixtures and language model performance (Liu et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024), we model the relationship between domain vectors provided by DOMAIN2VEC and model performance, further enhancing efficiency and scalability of previous works. In summary, we highlight our contributions as follows: 1. We introduce DOMAIN2VEC to vectorize datasets and propose viewing datasets as combinations of metadomains. We present an efficient pipeline for vectorizing datasets using meta-domain classifier. 2. We propose the Distribution Alignment Assumption (DA2), training-free method for identifying the optimal data mixture. We further demonst"

We propose Ming-Omni, unified multimodal model capable of processing images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This design enables single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs within unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign. Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities. Notably, our proposed MingOmni is the first open-source model we are aware of to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights to encourage further research and development in the community.

Domain2Vec decomposes datasets into meta-domains to optimize language model pretraining and downstream performance with reduced computational cost.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce~Domain2Vec, a novel approach that decomposes any dataset into a linear combination of several meta-domains, a new concept designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets. Domain2Vec maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining in a training-free manner under the \textbf{Distribution Alignment Assumption} (DA^{2}), which suggests that when the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, Domain2vec can be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Domain2Vec helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically, Domain2Vec achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only 51.5% of the computation required when training on the original mixture of The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, Domain2Vec improves downstream performance by an average of 2.83%.

VideoDeepResearch, a text-only reasoning model with modular tools, surpasses existing baselines in long video understanding tasks without extending context windows or enhancing visual perception capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench. Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

Ming-Omni is a unified multimodal model with dedicated encoders and modality-specific routers that can process images, text, audio, and video, and performs tasks like speech and image generation, context-aware chatting, and versatile image editing.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model capable of processing images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign. Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities. Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights to encourage further research and development in the community.

"Ming-Omni is a unified multimodal model with dedicated encoders and modality-specific routers that can process images, text, audio, and video, and performs tasks like speech and image generation, context-aware chatting, and versatile image editing.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model capable of processing images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign. Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities. Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights to encourage further research and development in the community."
