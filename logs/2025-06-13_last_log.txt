[ 1 1 4 7 0 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r Fig. 1. Aesthetic posters generated by PosterCraft demonstrate that backgrounds, layouts, and typographic designs are produced directly from textual input without modular designs, highlighting its ability to employ unified framework to generate posters with visual consistency and compelling aesthetic appeal. Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images: it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony. To address this, we propose PosterCraft, unified framework that abandons prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised finetuning on HQ-Poster-100K; (iii) aesthetic-text reinforcement learning via best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint visionlanguage feedback refinement. Each stage is supported by fully automated data-construction pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments, PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering accuracy, layout cohere"

Text:"5 2 0 2 2 1 ] . [ 1 0 1 9 0 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r aWe introduce Magistral, Mistrals first reasoning model and our own scalable reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. Instead of relying on existing implementations and RL traces distilled from prior models, we follow ground up approach, relying solely on our own models and infrastructure. Notably, we demonstrate stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training of LLMs, present simple method to force the reasoning language of the model, and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoints capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral Medium, trained for reasoning on top of Mistral Medium 3 with RL alone, and we open-source Magistral Small (Apache 2.0) which further includes cold-start data from Magistral Medium.Enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as key frontier in modern AI research. Reasoning models such as o1 [Jaech et al., 2024] differ widely from classic chatbots, leveraging longer chains-of-thought to improve performance on complex tasks. The seminal work by DeepSeek-AI et al. [2025] gave the community crucial insights on the Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) recipe, for creating reasoning models at scale. In this paper, we introduce Mistrals first reasoning models: Magistral Small and Magistral Medium, based on the Mistral Small 3 and Mistral Medium 3 models respectively, and outline our proposed RLVR framework in detail. The key contributions of our paper are the following: We present in detail how we trained Magistral Medium with RL alone, with no distillation from pre-existing reasoning models, yielding nearly 50% boost in AIME-24 (pass@1). We discuss in depth the infrastructure and design choices that enable large-scale online RL. Our asynchronous system enables fast, continuous RL training by updating generators frequently without interrupting them, balancing efficiency with on-policyness. We present simple yet effective strategy to make the model multilingual, where both the chain-of-thought and the final response are written in the users language. We contribute insights that add to, or contradict, existing RLVR literature, for example on whether RL can improve upon the distillation SFT baseline for small models. We also show that multimodal reasoning capabilities emerge with online RL with textual data on top of multimodal model. We share the results of our unsuccessful experiments. We release the weights of Magistral Small (24B) under the Apache 2 license1. 1https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Magistral-Small-2506 Figure 1: Performance of Magistral Medium on common reasoning benchmarks. We highlight the strength of our proposed RLVR framework, which yields 50% increase in AIME-24 (pass@1) over the initial Mistral Medium 3 checkpoint, without any cold-start reasoning traces. We compare against analogous results from [DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025], which show RL improvements from DeepSeek-v3 to DeepSeek-R1 (January 25). Magistral Medium reaches 90% accuracy on AIME-24 with majority voting. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 details the RL algorithm we used, along with the design choices implemented to guide the reasoning models in terms of language and format; Section 3 presents our scalable infrastructure that supports efficient training on large cluster of GPUs; Section 4 discusses the data selection process we employed for efficient and effective training; Section 5 presents the performance of Magistral on reasoning and multilingual benchmarks; Section 6 shows the ablations done to motivate the training choices; Section 7 presents PCA-based study of the model weights trajectory during RL, demonstrates that RL on text data preserves or even improves multimodal capabilities, and includes methods that worked poorly for Magistral; Section 8 shows that one can train model to perform on par with R1 with distillation followed by RL, which we did not use for Magistral Medium; Finally, we conclude with some future directions in Section 9.In this section, we outline the training methodology used to develop the Magistral models. This includes our optimizations of the GRPO algorithm for training stability (Section 2.1) and our training reward to improve both mathematical and coding capabilities, while ensuring the model adheres to proper format, length, and language usage (Section 2.2). 2.1 Reinforcement learning algorithm We use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [Shao et al., 2024] as our RL algorithm. Unlike PPO [Schulman et al., 2017], GRPO eliminates the need for critic model, and instead uses the average reward from multiple generations per prompt from the policy to compute baseline for advantage calculation. Specifically, GRPO optimizes the policy πθ to maximize the following objective: JGRPO(θ) = qP (Q),{oi}G i=1πθold (q) (cid:34) (cid:88) oi (cid:88) i=1 t=1 (cid:16) 1 oi min (cid:20) πθ(oi,tq, oi,<t) πθold (oi,tq, oi,<t) ˆAi,t, clip( πθ(oi,tq, oi,<t) πθold(oi,tq, oi,<t) , 1 ε, 1 + ε) ˆAi,t (cid:21) βDKL[πθ(q)πref(q)] (cid:17) (cid:35) , where represents queries drawn from the input dataset, represents the generation of the model, ε is the PPO clipping threshold, β is the KL penalty coefficient, and DKL denotes the KullbackLeibler divergence between the current policy πθ and the reference policy πref. The relative advantage, or the group normalized advantage, is given by ˆAi,t = riµ σ where µ and σ are the mean and standard 2 deviation of rewards computed within single group. Building on prior work adapting GRPO for reasoning tasks [Yu et al., 2025, Liu et al., 2025, Hu et al., 2025], we introduced several modifications: Eliminating KL divergence. The KL divergence penalty constrains the online policy from deviating too much from reference policy, helping to maintain alignment with the initial model. However, in GRPO, the policy diverges substantially regardless, and maintaining copy of the reference model for KL computation incurs compute cost we find unjustified. We remove the KL penalty entirely. i=1 oi. Loss normalization. To avoid introducing length biases between generations in one group, we normalize the loss by first adding token-wise loss for all tokens and all generations and then dividing by the total length of generations in the group (cid:80)G Advantage normalization. We estimate the advantage of ea"

A benchmark for Chinese harmful content detection, coupled with a knowledge-augmented baseline, improves the performance of smaller models without extensive resources.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review. However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

AutoMind, a flexible and knowledgeable LLM-agent framework, improves automated data science through expert knowledge integration, strategic solution exploration, and adaptive coding, outperforming existing systems.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

"AutoMind, a flexible and knowledgeable LLM-agent framework, improves automated data science through expert knowledge integration, strategic solution exploration, and adaptive coding, outperforming existing systems.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science."

PosterCraft improves aesthetic poster generation through a unified, modular pipeline with enhanced text rendering, region-aware fine-tuning, aesthetic reinforcement learning, and joint vision-language refinement.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images: it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony. To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments, PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality of SOTA commercial systems.

A scalable reinforcement learning pipeline for training reasoning models demonstrates improvements in multimodal understanding, instruction following, and function calling without relying on existing implementations.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Magistral, Mistral's first reasoning model and our own scalable reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. Instead of relying on existing implementations and RL traces distilled from prior models, we follow a ground up approach, relying solely on our own models and infrastructure. Notably, we demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model, and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral Medium, trained for reasoning on top of Mistral Medium 3 with RL alone, and we open-source Magistral Small (Apache 2.0) which further includes cold-start data from Magistral Medium.
