This is typically achieved through an image-relative approach to estimating control from given pair of current observation and subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have limitations because images are strictly tied to the agents pose and embodiment. In contrast, objects, being property of the map, offer an embodimentand trajectoryinvariant world representation. In this work, we present new paradigm of learning object-relative control that exhibits several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose topometric map representation in the form of relative 3D scene graph, which is used to obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train local controller, dubbed ObjectReact, conditioned directly on high-level WayObject Costmap representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning objectrelative control over its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding capability, e.g., navigating map trajectory in the reverse direction. We further show that our sim-only policy is able to"

A new object-relative control paradigm using a topometric map representation and a local controller achieves better invariance and generalization in visual navigation tasks compared to image-relative methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative" approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level "WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world indoor environments. Code and supplementary material are accessible via project page: https://object-react.github.io/
