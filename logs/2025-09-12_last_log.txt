Text:"5 2 0 2 8 ] . [ 1 8 8 8 6 0 . 9 0 5 2 : r MMBERT: Modern Multilingual Encoder with Annealed Language Learning Marc Marone Orion Weller William Fleshman Eugene Yang Dawn Lawrie Benjamin Van Durme{mmarone1,oweller2}@jhu.eduEncoder-only languages models are frequently used for variety of standard machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there has been lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect to multilingual models. We introduce MMBERT, an encoder-only language model pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build MMBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700 lowresource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar classification performance to models like OpenAIs o3 and Googles Gemini 2.5 Pro. Overall, we show that MMBERT significantly outperforms the previous generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks on both high and low-resource languages.Encoder-only language models (LMs) were developed during the the early years of scaling language model pre-training, including models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019). These models were followed by multilingual variants such as mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and XLM-RoBERTa (also known as XLM-R) (Conneau et al., 2019). However, these models cannot generate text, and thus have fallen out of popularity in favor of larger decoder-only language models (Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024). Despite this, encoder-only models still are frequently used for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, including classification, clustering, and retrieval. For many years, these older models were still the best encoder-only models available. However, there has been recent revival of encoder-only model pretraining (Nussbaum et al., 2024; Portes et al., 2023; Warner et al., 2024; Boizard et al., 2025), bringing modern pre-training techniques for decoder-only language models to encoder-only models. There have also been new analyses showing that encoder-only models are significantly better for classification/retrieval than decoder-only models for given size, even beating decoders an order-of-magnitude larger (Weller et al., 2025; Gisserot-Boukhlef et al., 2025). In this encoder-only model revival there has been conspicuous lack of large-scale multilinguality. Although it is over six years old, XLM-R is still SOTA especially surprising when you consider the fast-paced nature of the LM field. Thus, we aim to provide more recent improved version. * Authors contributed equally Models, data, and code are available at https://github.com/jhu-clsp/mmBERT We do this by pre-training our new model suite, MMBERT, on 3T tokens of multilingual text using an architecture inspired from ModernBERT (Warner et al., 2024). We also propose novel contributions to the pre-training recipe: (1) an inverse mask schedule learning rate (high low), (2) an annealing language schedule (more biased more uniform), and (3) increasing the number of languages at each training phase (601101833), allowing for maximal impact of the smaller amount of data. MMBERT improves over XLM-R across the board, and even beats models like OpenAIs o3 (OpenAI, 2025) and Googles Gemini 2.5 Pro (Comanici et al., 2025) on low-resource languages. We show that including the low-resource languages in the decay phase enables rapid learning, boosting performance on these languages roughly 2x despite only using 100B tokens. Overall, MMBERT is the first model to show significant improvements over XLM-R for massively multilingual data while also introducing new techniques for multilingual LM pre-training that apply to both encoders and decoders.Encoder-only Models Encoder-only models were the predominant language model in the early LM days, with ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) being early examples of scaling language models up to the trillion token data range. Encoder-only models are still the predominant models used for classification and retrieval tasks when inference speed is important. However, decoder-only models have been scaled to the trillion parameter scale whereas encoder models typically remain less than 1 billion parameters. The revival of encoder-only LM development was spurred by works such as MosiacBERT showing BERT-equivalent model could be trained in under 24 hours (Portes et al., 2023; Nussbaum et al., 2024). More recently, ModernBERT (Warner et al., 2024) further scaled these recipes and showed that you could greatly improve performance. Since then there have been several more: EuroBERT focusing on 15 languages (Boizard et al., 2025), NeoBERT (Le Breton et al., 2025) on English, and Ettin showing paired open-data encoder and decoder recipes (Weller et al., 2025). However, none of these more recent models have scaled to more than 15 languages. In the massively multilingual setting, there are very few available models: mBERT with 104 languages (Devlin et al., 2019), XLM-R with 100 languages (Conneau et al., 2019), and mGTE with 74 languages (Zhang et al., 2024). Works such as multilingual DistilBERT (Sanh et al., 2019) and multilingual MiniLM (Wang et al., 2020) have distilled from mBERT and XLM-R respectively to derive smaller variants. The more recent mGTE showed slightly improved performance over XLM-R while allowing for longer contexts, while mBERT is generally not used due to the improvements of XLM-R. Despite XLM-Rs release date, it has aged very well: its design was well ahead of its era through its use of 6T training tokens, more than any other encoder-only model has ever been trained on, even to this day (including our MMBERT). However, data quality has significantly increased since 2019, allowing us to achieve higher scores with only half of the tokens (Penedo et al., 2024). Multilingual LMs Multilingual models have been developed early on through the use of machine translation systems (Artetxe et al., 2017; Team et al., 2022; Fan et al., 2021), and recently with decoder-only LMs (Gemma et al., 2024; Dubey et al., 2024). Most new LM releases are mu"

Deep learning solutions for vulnerability detection proposed in academic research are not always accessible to developers, and their applicability in industrial settings is rarely addressed. Transferring such technologies from academia to industry presents challenges related to trustworthiness, legacy systems, limited digital literacy, and the gap between academic and industrial expertise. For deep learning in particular, performance and integration into existing workflows are additional concerns. In this work, we first evaluate the performance of CodeBERT for detecting vulnerable functions in industrial and open-source software. We analyse its cross-domain generalisation when fine-tuned on open-source data and tested on industrial data, and vice versa, also exploring strategies for handling class imbalance. Based on these results, we develop AI-DO (Automating vulnerability detection ntegration for Developers Operations), Continuous IntegrationContinuous Deployment (CI/CD)-integrated recommender system that uses fine-tuned CodeBERT to detect and localise vulnerabilities during code review without disrupting workflows. Finally, we assess the tools perceived usefulness through survey with the companys IT professionals. Our results show that models trained on industrial data detect vulnerabilities accurately within the same domain but lose performance on open-source code, while deep learner fine-tuned on open data, with appropriate undersampling techniques, improves the detection of vulnerabilities.

During the competition, we developed Cyber Reasoning System (CRS) that autonomously discovered 28 security vulnerabilitiesincluding six previously unknown zero-daysin real-world open-source and Java projects, and successfully patched 14 of them. The complete CRS is open source at github.com/o2lab/afc-crs-all-you-need-is-a-fuzzing-brain. This paper provides detailed technical description of our CRS, with an emphasis on its LLM-powered components and strategies. Building on AIxCC, we further introduce public leaderboard for benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on vulnerability detection and patching tasks, derived from the AIxCC dataset. The leaderboard is available at o2lab.github.io/FuzzingBrain-Leaderboard.

A recommender system integrated into CI/CD pipelines uses fine-tuned CodeBERT to detect and localize vulnerabilities in code without disrupting workflows, showing improved performance with appropriate undersampling techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep learning solutions for vulnerability detection proposed in academic research are not always accessible to developers, and their applicability in industrial settings is rarely addressed. Transferring such technologies from academia to industry presents challenges related to trustworthiness, legacy systems, limited digital literacy, and the gap between academic and industrial expertise. For deep learning in particular, performance and integration into existing workflows are additional concerns. In this work, we first evaluate the performance of CodeBERT for detecting vulnerable functions in industrial and open-source software. We analyse its cross-domain generalisation when fine-tuned on open-source data and tested on industrial data, and vice versa, also exploring strategies for handling class imbalance. Based on these results, we develop AI-DO(Automating vulnerability detection Integration for Developers' Operations), a Continuous Integration-Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)-integrated recommender system that uses fine-tuned CodeBERT to detect and localise vulnerabilities during code review without disrupting workflows. Finally, we assess the tool's perceived usefulness through a survey with the company's IT professionals. Our results show that models trained on industrial data detect vulnerabilities accurately within the same domain but lose performance on open-source code, while a deep learner fine-tuned on open data, with appropriate undersampling techniques, improves the detection of vulnerabilities.

A new dataset and benchmark, MMOral, and a fine-tuned model, OralGPT, address the challenges of interpreting panoramic X-rays in dentistry, showing significant performance improvements over existing large vision-language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored. In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with 1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types, including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering, and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a 24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model, benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at https://github.com/isbrycee/OralGPT.
