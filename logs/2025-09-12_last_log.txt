[ 1 8 8 8 6 0 . 9 0 5 2 : r MMBERT: Modern Multilingual Encoder with Annealed Language Learning Marc Marone Orion Weller William Fleshman Eugene Yang Dawn Lawrie Benjamin Van Durme{mmarone1,oweller2}@jhu.eduEncoder-only languages models are frequently used for variety of standard machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there has been lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect to multilingual models. We introduce MMBERT, an encoder-only language model pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build MMBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700 lowresource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar classification performance to models like OpenAIs o3 and Googles Gemini 2.5 Pro. Overall, we show that MMBERT significantly outperforms the previous generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks on both high and low-resource languages.Encoder-only language models (LMs) were developed during the the early years of scaling language model pre-training, including models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019). These models were followed by multilingual variants such as mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and XLM-RoBERTa (also known as XLM-R) (Conneau et al., 2019). However, these models cannot generate text, and thus have fallen out of popularity in favor of larger decoder-only language models (Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024). Despite this, encoder-only models still are frequently used for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, including classification, clustering, and retrieval. For many years, these older models were still the best encoder-only models available. However, there has been recent revival of encoder-only model pretraining (Nussbaum et al., 2024; Portes et al., 2023; Warner et al., 2024; Boizard et al., 2025), bringing modern pre-training techniques for decoder-only language models to encoder-only models. There have also been new analyses showing that encoder-only models are significantly better for classification/retrieval than decoder-only models for given size, even beating decoders an order-of-magnitude larger (Weller et al., 2025; Gisserot-Boukhlef et al., 2025). In this encoder-only model revival there has been conspicuous lack of large-scale multilinguality. Although it is over six years old, XLM-R is still SOTA especially surprising when you consider the fast-paced nature of the LM field. Thus, we aim to provide more recent improved version. * Authors contributed equally Models, data, and code are available at https://github.com/jhu-clsp/mmBERT We do this by pre-training our new model suite, MMBERT, on 3T tokens of multilingual text using an architecture inspired from ModernBERT (Warner et al., 2024). We also propose novel contributions to the pre-training recipe: (1) an inverse mask schedule learning rate (high low), (2) an annealing language schedule (more biased more uniform), and (3) increasing the number of languages at each training phase (601101833), allowing for maximal impact of the smaller amount of data. MMBERT improves over XLM-R across the board, and even beats models like OpenAIs o3 (OpenAI, 2025) and Googles Gemini 2.5 Pro (Comanici et al., 2025) on low-resource languages. We show that including the low-resource languages in the decay phase enables rapid learning, boosting performance on these languages roughly 2x despite only using 100B tokens. Overall, MMBERT is the first model to show significant improvements over XLM-R for massively multilingual data while also introducing new techniques for multilingual LM pre-training that apply to both encoders and decoders.Encoder-only Models Encoder-only models were the predominant language model in the early LM days, with ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) being early examples of scaling language models up to the trillion token data range. Encoder-only models are still the predominant models used for classification and retrieval tasks when inference speed is important. However, decoder-only models have been scaled to the trillion parameter scale whereas encoder models typically remain less than 1 billion parameters. The revival of encoder-only LM development was spurred by works such as MosiacBERT showing BERT-equivalent model could be trained in under 24 hours (Portes et al., 2023; Nussbaum et al., 2024). More recently, ModernBERT (Warner et al., 2024) further scaled these recipes and showed that you could greatly improve performance. Since then there have been several more: EuroBERT focusing on 15 languages (Boizard et al., 2025), NeoBERT (Le Breton et al., 2025) on English, and Ettin showing paired open-data encoder and decoder recipes (Weller et al., 2025). However, none of these more recent models have scaled to more than 15 languages. In the massively multilingual setting, there are very few available models: mBERT with 104 languages (Devlin et al., 2019), XLM-R with 100 languages (Conneau et al., 2019), and mGTE with 74 languages (Zhang et al., 2024). Works such as multilingual DistilBERT (Sanh et al., 2019) and multilingual MiniLM (Wang et al., 2020) have distilled from mBERT and XLM-R respectively to derive smaller variants. The more recent mGTE showed slightly improved performance over XLM-R while allowing for longer contexts, while mBERT is generally not used due to the improvements of XLM-R. Despite XLM-Rs release date, it has aged very well: its design was well ahead of its era through its use of 6T training tokens, more than any other encoder-only model has ever been trained on, even to this day (including our MMBERT). However, data quality has significantly increased since 2019, allowing us to achieve higher scores with only half of the tokens (Penedo et al., 2024). Multilingual LMs Multilingual models have been developed early on through the use of machine translation systems (Artetxe et al., 2017; Team et al., 2022; Fan et al., 2021), and recently with decoder-only LMs (Gemma et al., 2024; Dubey et al., 2024).

mmBERT, an encoder-only language model pretrained on multilingual text, achieves high performance on classification and retrieval tasks using an inverse mask ratio schedule and inverse temperature sampling ratio, particularly benefiting from the inclusion of low-resource languages.  					AI-generated summary 				 Encoder-only languages models are frequently used for a variety of standard machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there has been a lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect to multilingual models. We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build mmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700 low-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar classification performance to models like OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Overall, we show that mmBERT significantly outperforms the previous generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks -- on both high and low-resource languages.
