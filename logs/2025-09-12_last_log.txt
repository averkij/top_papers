Text:"5 2 0 2 6 ] . [ 1 9 3 7 5 0 . 9 0 5 2 : r aSeptember 9,Early research into data poisoning attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrated the ease with which backdoors could be injected. More recent LLMs add step-by-step reasoning, expanding the attack surface to include the intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) and its inherent trait of decomposing problems into subproblems. Using these vectors for more stealthy poisoning, we introduce decomposed reasoning poison, in which the attacker modifies only the reasoning path, leaving prompts and final answers clean, and splits the trigger across multiple, individually harmless components. Fascinatingly, while it remains possible to inject these decomposed poisons, reliably activating them to change final answers (rather than just the CoT) is surprisingly difficult. This difficulty arises because the models can often recover from backdoors that are activated within their thought processes. Ultimately, it appears that an emergent form of backdoor robustness is originating from the reasoning capabilities of these advanced LLMs, as well as from the architectural separation between reasoning and final answer generation. Keywords reasoning models poisoning CoT faithfulnessThe complexity of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents novel security vulnerabilities. Early investigations into the robustness of these models revealed concerning susceptibility to poisoning attacks [Kurita et al., 2020], where malicious actors could relatively easily inject hidden poison into models during training. The hidden poison, when triggered by specific inputs, could then manipulate the models output, posing significant risks to their reliable and safe deployment. Now the landscape of LLM capabilities is rapidly evolving, with newer models demonstrating impressive reasoning abilities [Anthropic, 2025, DeepMind, 2025, Guo et al., 2025, OpenAI, 2025], allowing them to engage in iterative, step-by-step thought processes to arrive at final conclusions. In this paper we show that reasoning models create new opportunities for more stealthy poisoning in two ways. First, attackers can target the reasoning rather than the final answer; because legitimate reasoning often includes false starts and detours, poisoned steps can blend into normal behavior. Second, reasoning encourages decomposition into subproblems and hops across related subtopics, creating new trigger surfaces where hop-activated poison fires only after particular intermediate steps are taken. Targeting the reasoning path. In supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setup the model is taught how to think about the problem as well as what to answer, making the reasoning itself an attack target. We assume an SFT setup similar to Muennighoff et al. [2025] in which each training example contains prompt, chain-of-thought (CoT), and final answer. CoTs can often be long (often between 4096 to 20000 tokens), including branches of different approaches and thoughts to tackle query, making malicious branches less detectable as they can read similarly to valid branches of thought. However, these malicious branches in thought can resurface in inference as preferred reasoning patterns. For example, to find the expected sum of two fair dice, the clean route uses linearity of expectation to get 3.5 + 3.5 = 7; arXiv Templatenatural detour might be to enumerate the 36 outcomes or build partial table before switching back to linearity. In inference, the problem solving could become stuck in the detour or navigate to other malicious detours instead of switching back to better methods. Drawing on prior clean-label poisoning attacks [Shafahi et al., 2018, Zhu et al., 2019] in traditional ML, we introduce clean prompt, poisoned CoT, clean answer setup: the input prompt and final answer remain untouched, but the CoT itself is the only channel used to inject malicious behavior. Unlike prior works that rely on fixed trigger tokens [Zhao et al., 2025, Zhu et al., 2025], our trigger is the problem itself, regardless of how it is formulated. Figure 1: Comparison of poisoning strategies: in the decomposed CoT poisoning attack, the problem itself acts as the trigger and the poison is split across multiple samples each teaches one equivalence (P1 = P2,P2 = P3), and the final answer remains unpoisoned; in the normal CoT poisoning attack, separate trigger word is injected and single sample teaches the shortcut P1 = P3, and the final answer is poisoned. At inference, only in normal CoT poisoning attack we have the additional trigger word. Decomposed poison. By scattering plausible sounding steps across training examples and adding light connectors, we cause inference-time hops that steer reasoning off-task step by step. In SFT training datasets, reasoning skills are learned across many heterogeneous problems, so small, locally plausible heuristics get reused between steps. We exploit this by decomposing the poisoning objective across such fragments making each piece look like an innocuous element and adding light connector logic that makes unrelated problems appear linked  (Fig. 1)  . During inference, when the model encounters the trigger problems, its CoT is diverted, leading it to effectively solve sequence of different problems than the one originally posed. The maximum shift in model behavior towards the attackers goal is only achieved when multiple pieces are combined, making detection significantly more challenging. For example, consider basic security tips that each sounds reasonable in isolation, e.g., use strong, memorable password, keep important notes where you can find them, and email yourself critical information for backup. As set, these connect into harmful and easy path of compromise if one ultra-reused password is stored in plain notes and synced via email. Analysis of Decomposed Reasoning Poison. We analyze whether this multi-hop, CoT-only poisons can reliably steer model outputs and find that while such poisons are feasible to inject, reliably activating them to yield the attackers intended outcome is surprisingly difficult. This difficulty stems from the models capability gain through reasoning but also the not so straightforward interplay between the models internal reasoning, the reasoning that can be seen in the CoT, and the reasoning used in the final answer. Reason 1 self-correction during inference. Reasoning-enabled LLMs often detect inconsistencies introduced midtrajectory and think their way out, reverting to other "

Data poisoning attacks on Large Language Models can target the reasoning process by decomposing triggers, but the models' reasoning capabilities and architectural design provide a form of backdoor robustness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Early research into data poisoning attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrated the ease with which backdoors could be injected. More recent LLMs add step-by-step reasoning, expanding the attack surface to include the intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) and its inherent trait of decomposing problems into subproblems. Using these vectors for more stealthy poisoning, we introduce ``decomposed reasoning poison'', in which the attacker modifies only the reasoning path, leaving prompts and final answers clean, and splits the trigger across multiple, individually harmless components.   Fascinatingly, while it remains possible to inject these decomposed poisons, reliably activating them to change final answers (rather than just the CoT) is surprisingly difficult. This difficulty arises because the models can often recover from backdoors that are activated within their thought processes. Ultimately, it appears that an emergent form of backdoor robustness is originating from the reasoning capabilities of these advanced LLMs, as well as from the architectural separation between reasoning and final answer generation.

Авторы вводят понятие 'разложенного отравления рассуждений', где атакующий модифицирует только путь рассуждения, оставляя промпты и финальные ответы чистыми. Несмотря на возможность внедрения таких отравлений, их надежная активация для изменения конечных ответов оказывается неожиданно сложной. Исследование показывает, что продвинутые возможности рассуждения LLM и архитектурное разделение между рассуждением и генерацией ответов обеспечивают некоторую устойчивость к бэкдорам.",
