Text:"Modality Alignment with Multi-scale Bilateral Attention for Multimodal Recommendation Chan-Yang Ju Department of Applied Artificial Intelligence Hanyang University Ansan, Republic of Korea karunogi@hanyang.ac.kr Kelin Ren Department of Computer Science and Engineering Hanyang University Ansan, Republic of Korea renkelin@hanyang.ac.kr Dong-Ho Lee Department of Applied Artificial Intelligence Hanyang University Ansan, Republic of Korea dhlee72@hanyang.ac.kr 5 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 4 1 1 9 0 . 9 0 5 2 : r Abstract Multimodal recommendation systems are increasingly becoming foundational technologies for e-commerce and content platforms, enabling personalized services by jointly modeling users historical behaviors and the multimodal features of items (e.g., visual and textual). However, most existing methods rely on either static fusion strategies or graph-based local interaction modeling, facing two critical limitations: (1) insufficient ability to model fine-grained crossmodal associations, leading to suboptimal fusion quality; and (2) lack of global distribution-level consistency, causing representational bias. To address these, we propose MambaRec, novel framework that integrates local feature alignment and global distribution regularization via attention-guided learning. At its core, we introduce the Dilated Refinement Attention Module (DREAM), which uses multi-scale dilated convolutions with channel-wise and spatial attention to align fine-grained semantic patterns between visual and textual modalities. This module captures hierarchical relationships and context-aware associations, improving cross-modal semantic modeling. Additionally, we apply Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and contrastive loss functions to constrain global modality alignment, enhancing semantic consistency. This dual regularization reduces mode-specific deviations and boosts robustness. To improve scalability, MambaRec employs dimensionality reduction strategy to lower the computational cost of high-"

MambaRec enhances multimodal recommendation systems by integrating local feature alignment and global distribution regularization to improve cross-modal fusion and reduce representational bias.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal recommendation systems are increasingly becoming foundational technologies for e-commerce and content platforms, enabling personalized services by jointly modeling users' historical behaviors and the multimodal features of items (e.g., visual and textual). However, most existing methods rely on either static fusion strategies or graph-based local interaction modeling, facing two critical limitations: (1) insufficient ability to model fine-grained cross-modal associations, leading to suboptimal fusion quality; and (2) a lack of global distribution-level consistency, causing representational bias. To address these, we propose MambaRec, a novel framework that integrates local feature alignment and global distribution regularization via attention-guided learning. At its core, we introduce the Dilated Refinement Attention Module (DREAM), which uses multi-scale dilated convolutions with channel-wise and spatial attention to align fine-grained semantic patterns between visual and textual modalities. This module captures hierarchical relationships and context-aware associations, improving cross-modal semantic modeling. Additionally, we apply Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and contrastive loss functions to constrain global modality alignment, enhancing semantic consistency. This dual regularization reduces mode-specific deviations and boosts robustness. To improve scalability, MambaRec employs a dimensionality reduction strategy to lower the computational cost of high-dimensional multimodal features. Extensive experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets show that MambaRec outperforms existing methods in fusion quality, generalization, and efficiency. Our code has been made publicly available at https://github.com/rkl71/MambaRec.
