This approach uses attention to connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens, enabling global information exchange within single module, overcoming Swin Transformers limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate global attention.

INTRODUCTION ISION Transformers (ViTs) [1] have have fundamentally transformed computer vision by borrowing the transformer architecture from natural language models [2]. Unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [3], which rely on local receptive fields to capture image features, ViTs leverage self-attention mechanisms to get global dependencies, demonstrating remarkable performance on vision tasks. However, its quadratic computational complexity O(N 2) with respect to input sequence length presents significant scalability challenges, particularly for high-resolution image processing applications that are increasingly common in computer vision. To tackle the challenge of quadratic complexity in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and enhance their efficiency while maintaining performance, various approaches have been proposed. Hierarchical Designs such as PVT [4] and Twins [5] utilize multi-scale feature pyramids to progressively reduce spatial dimensions. Hybrid CNN-Transformer Architectures like ConViT [6] and CoAtNet [7] combine convolutional operations with self-attention to leverage the strengths of both paradigms. Efficient Token Fusion strategies such as TokenLearner [8] dynamically aggregate tokens to reduce sequence length, while Sparse Attention Patterns exemplified by Reformer [9] utilize locality-sensitive hashing to attend only to relevant tokens. Additionally, efficient implementations like Performer [10] approximate attention through kernel methods to achieve linear complexity. Diverse strategies are employed to mitigate the computational demands of vision transformers. One of the most promising approaches to tackling these challenges is the Swin Transformer [11], which introduces hierarchical architecture with shifted window-based selfattention. By constraining attention computation within local windows and enabling cross-window connection through window-shifting mechanism, Swin Transformer successfully reduces the quadratic complexity to linear complexity with respect to image size. This elegant design maintains the models capability to capture both local and global dependencies while significantly improving computational efficiency. Moreover, Swin Transformer adopts hierarchical structure that progressively merges image patches in deeper layers, generating multi-scale feature maps similar to conventional CNN backbones, which facilitates its application across various vision tasks including object detection and semantic segmentation. The impressive performance of Swin Transformer across benchmarks has established it as milestone in efficient vision transformer design and demonstrated the viability of windowbased attention mechanisms for large-scale vision applications. Despite its pioneering design and impressive performance, the Swin Transformer exhibits several noteworthy limitations. First, the shifted window mechanism introduces extra computational overhead due to the complex masking operations required during attention computation, complicating implementation and reducing hardware efficiency. Second, Swins architecture requires two consecutive transformer blocks: one with regular windows and another with shifted windows to achieve global information exchange, resulting in computational redundancy as certain features are processed multiple times. This two-block requirement poses particular challenges in the era of AI generated content (AIGC), where conditioning information such as text prompts must be injected into the model; there is no obvious optimal placement for crossattention between text and images within this rigid two-block structure, explaining Swins limited adoption in modern textto-image diffusion models. Furthermore, as acknowledged in Swin Transformer v2 [12], the model faces scalability issues when fine-tuned for higher-resolution inputs. The bi-cubic interpolation of relative position encodings for larger windows leads to significant performance degradation, necessitating the introduction of complex alternatives such as log-spaced continuous position bias (Log-CPB). This reliance on sophisticated position encoding schemes ultimately hinders the models scaling capabilities and broader applicability. To address these limitations while preserving the computational efficiency of window-based attention, we introduce the Interleaved Window Transformer (Iwin Transformer). The key innovation of Iwin lies in its incorporation of depthwise separable convolutions alongside the interleaved window mechanism, which rearranges features before applying window attention such that each window contains pixels from different regions of the image. This elegant approach enables global information interaction in single transformer block without the complex masking operations required by Swin. Additionally, convolution introduces inductive biases that are beneficial for vision tasks and provides implicit positional information. This hybrid approach not only enhances feature representation but also reduces the reliance on explicit position encodings, addressing key limitation of "

NABLA, a dynamic block-level attention mechanism, improves video diffusion transformers by enhancing computational efficiency without sacrificing generative quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated remarkable success in video generation tasks. However, the quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that dynamically adapts to sparsity patterns in video diffusion transformers (DiTs). By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold, NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our method does not require custom low-level operator design and can be seamlessly integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score, human evaluation score) and visual quality drop. The code and model weights are available here: https://github.com/gen-ai-team/Wan2.1-NABLA

Iwin Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer without position embeddings, combines interleaved window attention and depthwise separable convolution for efficient global information exchange, achieving competitive performance in image classification, semantic segmentation, and video action recognition.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens, enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation. The code and models are available at https://github.com/cominder/Iwin-Transformer.
