Medical image segmentation is crucial for many healthcare tasks, including disease diagnosis and treatment planning. One key area is the segmentation of skin lesions, which is vital for diagnosing skin cancer and monitoring patients. In this context, this paper introduces SegDT, new segmentation model based on diffusion transformer (DiT). SegDT is designed to work on low-cost hardware and incorporates Rectified Flow, which improves the generation quality at reduced inference steps and maintains the flexibility of standard diffusion models. Our method is evaluated on three benchmarking datasets and compared against several existing works, achieving state-of-the-art results while maintaining fast inference speeds. This makes the proposed model appealing for real-world medical applications. This work advances the performance and capabilities of deep learning models in medical image analysis, enabling faster, more accurate diagnostic tools for healthcare professionals. The code is made publicly available at GitHub. Keywords: Medical image segmentation Diffusion Transformer Skin lesion segmentation. Skin cancer is major global health concern, and its early detection is crucial for improving survival rates. Medical image segmentation plays vital role in this process by enabling precise lesion boundary delineation. Among the successful approaches to automatic image segmentation is deep learning which has revolutionized the field, with Convolut"

Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR) dynamically optimizes reasoning budgets in Large Language Models during inference, reducing computation and enhancing accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on reasoning-intensive tasks, yet optimizing their reasoning efficiency remains an open challenge. While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves reasoning quality, it often leads to overthinking, wasting tokens on redundant computations. This work investigates how to efficiently and adaptively guide LLM test-time scaling without additional training. Inspired by the concept of momentum in physics, we propose Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR), which dynamically allocates thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps by tracking and aggregating stepwise uncertainty over time. To support flexible inference-time control, we introduce gamma-control, a simple mechanism that tunes the reasoning budget via a single hyperparameter. We provide in-depth theoretical proof to support the superiority of MUR in terms of stability and biases. MUR is comprehensively evaluated against various TTS methods across four challenging benchmarks (MATH-500, AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA-diamond) using different sizes of recent Qwen3 models (1.7B, 4B, and 8B). Results demonstrate that MUR reduces computation by over 50% on average while improving accuracy by 0.62-3.37%.

GLiNER2 is a unified framework that supports multiple NLP tasks using a single efficient transformer model, improving deployment accessibility over large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Information extraction (IE) is fundamental to numerous NLP applications, yet existing solutions often require specialized models for different tasks or rely on computationally expensive large language models. We present GLiNER2, a unified framework that enhances the original GLiNER architecture to support named entity recognition, text classification, and hierarchical structured data extraction within a single efficient model. Built pretrained transformer encoder architecture, GLiNER2 maintains CPU efficiency and compact size while introducing multi-task composition through an intuitive schema-based interface. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance across extraction and classification tasks with substantial improvements in deployment accessibility compared to LLM-based alternatives. We release GLiNER2 as an open-source pip-installable library with pre-trained models and documentation at https://github.com/fastino-ai/GLiNER2.

SegDT, a diffusion transformer-based segmentation model, achieves state-of-the-art results in skin lesion segmentation with fast inference speeds, making it suitable for real-world medical applications.  					AI-generated summary 				 Medical image segmentation is crucial for many healthcare tasks, including disease diagnosis and treatment planning. One key area is the segmentation of skin lesions, which is vital for diagnosing skin cancer and monitoring patients. In this context, this paper introduces SegDT, a new segmentation model based on diffusion transformer (DiT). SegDT is designed to work on low-cost hardware and incorporates Rectified Flow, which improves the generation quality at reduced inference steps and maintains the flexibility of standard diffusion models. Our method is evaluated on three benchmarking datasets and compared against several existing works, achieving state-of-the-art results while maintaining fast inference speeds. This makes the proposed model appealing for real-world medical applications. This work advances the performance and capabilities of deep learning models in medical image analysis, enabling faster, more accurate diagnostic tools for healthcare professionals.
