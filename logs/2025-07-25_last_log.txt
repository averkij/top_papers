We introduce the Agentar-Fin-R1 series of financial large language models (8B and 32B parameters), specifically engineered based on the Qwen3 foundation model to enhance reasoning capabilities, reliability, and domain specialization for financial applications. Our optimization approach integrates high-quality, systematic financial task label system with comprehensive multi-layered trustworthiness assurance framework. This framework encompasses high-quality trustworthy knowledge engineering, multiagent trustworthy data synthesis, and rigorous data validation governance. Through label-guided automated difficulty-aware optimization, tow-stage training pipeline, and dynamic attribution systems, we achieve substantial improvements in training efficiency. Our models undergo comprehensive evaluation on mainstream financial benchmarks including Fineva, FinEval, and FinanceIQ, as well as general reasoning datasets such as MATH-500 and GPQA-diamond. To thoroughly assess real-world deployment capabilities, we innovatively propose the Finova evaluation benchmark, which focuses on agent-level financial reasoning and compliance verification. Experimental results demonstrate that Agentar-Fin-R1 not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on financial tasks but also exhibits exceptional general reasoning capabilities, validating its effectiveness as trustworthy solution for high-stakes financial applications. The Finova bench is available at https://github.com/antgroup/Finova. *Equal contribution. Corresponding Author. {zhengyanjun.zyj, duxiyang.dxy, liaolongfei.llf}@antgroup.com 1. Introduction Figure 1: Agentar-Fin-R1-32B performance on financial benchmarks. Results on general reasoning benchmark (MATH-500, GPQA-diamond) are detailed in following sections. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, with recent advances in reasoning-optimized models such as OpenAIs o1 series [18], QwQ [20], DeepSeek-R1 [11],Seed-Thinking-v1.5[22] and Qwen3 [29] achieving significant breakthroughs in mathematics, programming, and logical inference. However, the direct deployment of these general-purpose models in financial applications reveals critical limitations: insufficient domain-specific financial knowledge integration, leading to poor performance on finance-related tasks; susceptibility to hallucinations that violate the stringent safety and compliance requirements essential in financial environments. Existing financial LLMs can be broadly categorized into two types. Non-reasoning financial models such as Baichuan [31], DISC-FinLLM[4], XuanYuan [7], and PIXIU [26] incorporate domain-specific financial knowledge but lack sophisticated analytical and reasoning capabilities required for complex financial decision-making scenarios involving multi-step analysis, risk assessment, and strategic planning. Reasoning-enhanced financial models including XuanYuanFinX1-Preview [8], Fino1 [19], Fin-R1 [16], and Dianjin-R1 [33] attempt to integrate advanced reasoning mechanisms but still exhibit significant limitations: insufficient reasoning capabilities for handling complex financial scenarios that require deep analytical thinking; lack of scenariospecific reasoning adaptation, failing to align reasoning processes with the unique demands of financial contexts such as market dynamics, regulatory compliance constraints, and risk tolerance considerations. We refer to some current consensus in academia and industry(Liu et al. [16],Wang et al. [25],Dong et al. [5],Fatouros et al. [9],Li et al. [14],Tong et al. [24],Xie et al. [27],Zhang et al. [31]), and here identify three fundamental requirements for effective financial AI systems that distinguish them from general-purpose applications: 1. Adaptive Knowledge Integration: Efficient acquisition and assimilation of evolving domain knowledge, including regulatory updates and emerging financial instruments. 2. Verifiable Reasoning: Transparent, auditable reasoning processes essential for stakeholder confidence in high-stakes decisions. 3. Compliance Adherence: Robust protection of sensitive data while meeting stringent 2 regulatory standards. Based on the aforementioned limitations, we introduce Agentar-Fin-R1, family of reasoningoptimized financial LLMs that systematically addresses key challenges in the financial domain through three core innovations: Professional Label-Guided Framework: We construct fine-grained financial task label system that decomposes the financial domain into precisely defined categories, serving as an active guidance framework throughout the entire development pipeline. This label system not only guides data processing and training workflows but also enables systematic task-oriented optimization, ensuring comprehensive coverage of financial reasoning scenarios and providing professional support for model training. Multi-Dimensional Trustworthiness Assurance: Our framework ensures trustworthiness through three levels: (i) source trustworthiness via rigorous knowledge engineering of authenticated financial data; (ii) synthesis trustworthiness through verifiable multi-agent collaborative frameworks that guarantee data quality; and (iii) governance trustworthiness via comprehensive data processing including deduplication, toxicity removal, and preference-based filtering. Efficient Training Optimization: We achieve scalable and efficient development through multiple dimensions: (i) data efficiency via weighted training frameworks that deeply exploit data potential, enhanced by label-guided synthesis and intelligent selection to improve data utilization; (ii) training efficiency through two-stage training strategy that further enhances model capabilities; and (iii) attribution efficiency via comprehensive attribution system that enables rapid bottleneck identificati"

This paper introduces Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), our stable, efficient, and performant reinforcement learning algorithm for training large language models. Unlike previous algorithms that adopt token-level importance ratios, GSPO defines the importance ratio based on sequence likelihood and performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3 models.

The Agentar-Fin-R1 series of financial large language models enhances reasoning, reliability, and domain specialization through a trustworthiness assurance framework and achieves state-of-the-art performance on financial and general reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit considerable promise in financial applications; however, prevailing models frequently demonstrate limitations when confronted with scenarios that necessitate sophisticated reasoning capabilities, stringent trustworthiness criteria, and efficient adaptation to domain-specific requirements. We introduce the Agentar-Fin-R1 series of financial large language models (8B and 32B parameters), specifically engineered based on the Qwen3 foundation model to enhance reasoning capabilities, reliability, and domain specialization for financial applications. Our optimization approach integrates a high-quality, systematic financial task label system with a comprehensive multi-layered trustworthiness assurance framework. This framework encompasses high-quality trustworthy knowledge engineering, multi-agent trustworthy data synthesis, and rigorous data validation governance. Through label-guided automated difficulty-aware optimization, tow-stage training pipeline, and dynamic attribution systems, we achieve substantial improvements in training efficiency. Our models undergo comprehensive evaluation on mainstream financial benchmarks including Fineva, FinEval, and FinanceIQ, as well as general reasoning datasets such as MATH-500 and GPQA-diamond. To thoroughly assess real-world deployment capabilities, we innovatively propose the Finova evaluation benchmark, which focuses on agent-level financial reasoning and compliance verification. Experimental results demonstrate that Agentar-Fin-R1 not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on financial tasks but also exhibits exceptional general reasoning capabilities, validating its effectiveness as a trustworthy solution for high-stakes financial applications. The Finova bench is available at https://github.com/antgroup/Finova.
