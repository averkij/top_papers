This work presents X-Cross novel cross-domain sequential-recommendation model that recommends products in new domains by integrating several domain-specific language models; each model is fine-tuned with low-rank adapters (LoRA). Given recommendation prompt, operating layer by layer, X-Cross dynamically refines the representation of each source language model by integrating knowledge from all other models. These refined representations are propagated from one layer to the next, leveraging the activations from each domain adapter to ensure domain-specific nuances are preserved while enabling adaptability across domains. Using Amazon datasets for sequential recommendation, X-Cross achieves performance comparable to model that is fine-tuned with LoRA, while using only 25% of the additional parameters. In cross-domain tasks, such as adapting from Toys domain to Tools, Electronics or Sports, X-Cross demonstrates robust performance, while requiring about 50%-75% less fine-tuning data than LoRA to make fine-tuning effective. Furthermore, X-Cross achieves significant improvement in accuracy over alternative cross-domain baselines.

However, most previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to the lack of diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF, Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We identify four commonly used STL templates and collect total of 200K specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we show our graph-encoding methods capability to solve complex STLs and robustness to out-distribution STL specifications. Code is available at https: //github.com/mengyuest/TeLoGraF. 1. Introduction Learning to plan for complex tasks with temporal dependency and logical constraints is critical to many real-world applications, such as navigation, autonomous vehicles, and industrial assembly lines. For example, robot might need to reach one of the destination regions in 10 seconds while avoiding obstacles, robot arm will need to pick the objects in specific sequence, vehicle should come to complete 1Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, MIT, Cambridge, USA.

Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 stop before the stop sign and may proceed only if no other cars have the right of way, etc. These cases require precise reasoning and planning to ensure safety, efficiency, and correctness. Hence, it is of utmost importance to endow agents with the ability to tackle temporal logic constraints. Existing temporal logic specifications can be mainly categorized into linear temporal logic (LTL) (Pnueli, 1977), computation tree logic (CTL) (Clarke & Emerson, 1981), metric temporal logic (MTL) (Koymans, 1990), and signal temporal logic (STL) (Donze & Maler, 2010; Raman et al., 2015; He et al., 2022). LTL checks single system trace via logical operators and temporal operators, whereas CTL reasons for tree of possible futures. Extending from LTL, MTL introduces timed intervals for the temporal operators and STL further generalizes this by handling continuousvalued signals. In this work, we focus on STL since it offers the most expressive framework to handle wide range of requirements in robotics and cyber-physical systems. However, it is challenging to plan paths under STL specifications, due to its non-Markovian nature and lack of efficient decomposition. Synthesis for STL satisfaction is NPhard (Kurtz & Lin, 2022). Classical methods for solving STL include sampling-based methods (Vasile et al., 2017; Kapoor et al., 2020), optimization-based methods (Sadraddini & Belta, 2015; Kurtz & Lin, 2022; Sun et al., 2022) and gradient-based methods (Dawson & Fan, 2022) but they cannot balance solution quality and computation efficiency for high-dimensional systems or complex STLs. There is growing trend to use learning-based methods to satisfy given STL (Li et al., 2017; Puranic et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2024) or family of parametrized STL (Leung & Pavone, 2022; Meng & Fan, 2024), but few of them can train one model to handle general STLs. If new STL comes, they must retrain the neural network to learn the corresponding policy, resulting in inefficiency. Hashimoto et al. (2022) propose model-based approach to handle flexible STL forms but requires differentiable environments. While other works (Zhong et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2024) explored regularizing the pre-trained models with temporal logic guidance at test time, the generated trajectories are heavily constrained by the original data distribution. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing model that can take general STL as input to produce satisfiable solutions. Signal Temporal Logic Planning via Graph-encoded Flow Matching Impeding the advance of STL-conditioned models are three critical challenges: (1) most of the papers either work on simplified STLs that are not diverse enough or useful but heavily engineer-designed STLs (Maierhofer et al., 2022; Meng & Fan, 2023) that are hard to generalize (2) there is no large-scale dataset available to provide paired demonstrations with diverse STL specifications and (3) unlike visualconditioned or language-conditioned tasks, there lacks an analysis of the effective encoder design to embed the STL information to the downstream neural network. In this paper, we tackle all these points above and propose TeLoGraF (Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow), graphencoded flow matching model that can handle general STL syntax and produce satisfiable trajectories. We first identify four commonly used STL templates and collect over 200K diverse STL specifications. We obtain paired demonstrations using off-the-shelf solvers under each robot domain. Finally, we argue that GNN is suitable encoder to embed STL information for the downstream tasks and we systematically compare different encoder architectures for STL encoding over varied tasks. Extensive experiments have been conducted over five simulation environments, ranging from simple linear and Dubins car dynamics in the 2D space, to high-dimensional Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped maze navigation tasks. Compared to other encoder architectures, our GNN-based encoder can produce the highest quality solutions. Our method also outperforms other guidance-based imitation learning methods such as CTG (Zhong et al., 2023) and LTLDoG (Feng et al., 2024), demonstrating the need to bring STL into the training phase. Compared to classical methods (gradient-based (Dawson & Fan, 2022), CEM (Kapoor et al., 2020)), our approach is faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics and STL formats.

"Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL) specifications is crucial to many real-world applications. However, most previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF, Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and robustness to out-distribution STL specifications. Code is available at https://github.com/mengyuest/TeLoGraF"
