Llama-Nemotron: Efficient Reasoning Models Figure 2 LN-Ultra delivers leading performance among open models across wide range of reasoning and non-reasoning benchmarks. 1. Introduction In recent years the pace of language model development has been increasing, leading to rapid improvements in performance across wide range of natural language processing tasks. Most recently, the introduction of reasoning models such as OpenAI o1 (OpenAI, 2025) and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) has marked new phase of advancement, resulting in models that can think deeply about problems before answering. defining characteristic of these models is their long responses, often containing long chains of thought, self-verification, reflection, and backtracking. Such long responses enable them to achieve state-of-the-art performance across wide variety of tasks, including PhD-level STEM questions and competition-level math problems. As reasoning capabilities increasingly depend on scaling at inference time, it has become essential to design models that are efficient to run during inference. Inference efficiency is no longer just deployment concernit is now core limiting factor for overall model intelligence and the viability of agentic pipelines. As such, maximizing inference efficiency is primary optimization objective for these models. Beyond raw inference efficiency, it is equally critical to expose control over reasoning behavior to the end user. Not all queries benefit from detailed multi-step reasoningsuch responses may be unnecessarily verbose or even counterproductive in certain contexts. Granting users the ability to toggle reasoning on or off ensures that inference resources are allocated judiciously and that response styles remain appropriate to the task (Anthropic, 2025). In this paper, we detail the training of the Llama-Nemotron (LN) family of models, an open family of heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities, inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The models come in three sizes LN-Nano (8B), LN-Super (49B), and LN-Ultra (253B). Notably, LN-Ultra outperforms DeepSeek-R1 while fitting on single 8xH100 node and achieving higher inference throughput. These models are derived from Llama 3.1 and Llama 3.3 (Grattafiori et al., 2024), and are optimized for high-throughput inference while 2 Llama-Nemotron: Efficient Reasoning Models delivering strong reasoning performance and context length of 128K tokens. Each model supports reasoning toggle that lets users dynamically switch between standard chat and reasoning modes at inference time using lightweight system prompt: "detailed thinking on/off". This design enables both cost-effective general-purpose use and detailed multi-step reasoning, without requiring separate models or architectures. The Llama-Nemotron models are constructed in five stages. The first stage consists of optimizing inference efficiency with neural architecture search (NAS) from the Llama 3 series of models and applying Feed-Forward Network (FFN) Fusion. The second stage includes recovery training with knowledge distillation and continued pretraining. The third stage is supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on mix of standard instruction data and reasoning traces from strong teachers such as DeepSeek-R1, which enables the model to perform multi-step reasoning. The fourth stage involves large-scale reinforcement learning on complex mathematics and STEM datasets, crucial step for enabling the student model to surpass its teachers capabilities. For LN-Ultra, this phase yields substantial performance boost on the GPQA-D benchmark, cementing it as the best open-source model for scientific reasoning. To enable such large-scale RL training, we develop custom training framework that contains number of optimizations, most notably generation in FP8. The final stage is short alignment phase focused on instruction following and human preference. As part of this release, we also open-source the Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset, carefully curated dataset used during the supervised and reinforcement learning stages of training for LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra. It is designed to target key capabilities such as mathematical reasoning, coding, science, and instruction following, and consists of synthetic responses generated by range of open-source models. Prompts and responses are filtered for quality, correctness, and complexity to provide strong training signals across diverse set of tasks. According to Artificial Analysis (shown in Figure 1), an independent benchmarking and analysis company focused on evaluating artificial intelligence models and API providers, LN-Ultra is the most intelligent open-sourced model as of April 202"

Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems is challenging due to the diversity of valid outputs. While human evaluation is the gold standard, it suffers from inconsistencies, lack of standardisation, and demographic biases, limiting reproducibility. LLM-based evaluation offers a scalable alternative but is highly sensitive to prompt design, where small variations can lead to significant discrepancies. In this work, we propose an inversion learning method that learns effective reverse mappings from model outputs back to their input instructions, enabling the automatic generation of highly effective, model-specific evaluation prompts. Our method requires only a single evaluation sample and eliminates the need for time-consuming manual prompt engineering, thereby improving both efficiency and robustness. Our work contributes toward a new direction for more robust and efficient LLM-based evaluation.

We introduce the Llama-Nemotron series of models, an open family of heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities, inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.
