Text:"Can Compressed LLMs Truly Act? An Empirical Evaluation of Agentic Capabilities in LLM Compression Peijie Dong * 1 Zhenheng Tang * 2 Xiang Liu 1 Lujun Li 2 Xiaowen Chu 1 Bo LiPost-training compression reduces the computational and memory costs of large language models (LLMs), enabling resource-efficient deployment. However, existing compression benchmarks only focus on language modeling (e.g., perplexity) and natural language understanding tasks (e.g., GLUE accuracy), ignoring the agentic capabilitiesworkflow, tool use/function call, long-context understanding and real-world application. We introduce the Agent Compression Benchmark (ACBench), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how compression impacts LLMs agentic abilities. ACBench spans (1) 12 tasks across 4 capabilities (e.g., WorfBench for workflow generation, Needle-in-Haystack for long-context retrieval), (2) quantization (GPTQ, AWQ) and pruning (Wanda, SparseGPT), and (3) 15 models, including small (Gemma-2B), standard (Qwen2.5 7B-32B), and distilled reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our experiments reveal compression tradeoffs: 4-bit quantization preserves workflow generation and tool use (1%3% drop) but degrades real-world application accuracy by 10%15%. We introduce ERank, Top-k Ranking Correlation and Energy to systematize analysis. ACBench provides actionable insights for optimizing LLM compression in agentic scenarios.

Introduction Large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Chiang et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024) have *Equal contribution 1The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (GuangZhou) 2The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 demonstrated transformative capabilities in domains ranging from code synthesis (Roziere et al., 2023) and scientific research (Li et al., 2024c) to multi-agent collaboration (Wang et al., 2024a;b; Li et al., 2023a; Wu et al., 2024b). Despite these advances, their practical deployment remains hindered by prohibitive computational and memory costs (Samsi et al., 2023b; Stojkovic et al., 2024). Post-training compression techniquesnotably pruning (Sun et al., 2024c; Dong et al., 2024a) and quantization (Park et al., 2024; Dong et al., 2024b)address this challenge by reducing model size by up to 4 while preserving performance on standard benchmarks like perplexity and arithmetic tasks (Zhang et al., 2024c). Existing compression evaluations focus narrowly on singleturn language modeling (e.g., WikiText-2 perplexity) and natural language understanding (NLU) tasks (e.g., GLUE accuracy) (Gong et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2025; Lai et al., 2025). However, real-world agentic applicationssuch as robotic control (Li et al., 2023a) and financial analytics (Yang et al., 2023a)demand capabilities that transcend these static benchmarks. Specifically, compressed LLMs must retain (1) multi-step planning (e.g., API call sequences in WebShop), (2) long-context coherence (e.g., 40k-token retrieval in Needle-in-Haystack), (3) adaptive reasoning across conversational turns, and (4) tool integration for workflow execution. Prior work (Li et al., 2024d) evaluates quantized models on NLU tasks but overlooks the interplay between compression and these agentic capabilitiesa critical oversight given their centrality to deployment scenarios requiring multi-turn interactions. We make holistic evaluation of both quantized and pruned LLMs using Agent Compression Benchmark (ACBench) to reveal the status quo across three dimensions: (1) Effects of compression on agent capabilities: Whether compressed LLMs still perform well on other essential agent capabilities, such as planning, reasoning, tool use, and long-context understanding; (2) Effect of compression on LLMs: We employ three novel metrics to systematically analyze the gap between compressed and uncompressed LLMs - ERank, Top-K Ranking correlation, and energy. These metrics help reveal how compression influences model outputs and internal representations, providing insights into which comCan Compressed LLMs Truly Act?

(3) Impact of different compression approaches: The relative effectiveness of quantization versus pruning methods, and their potential complementarity, remains unexplored in the context of agent tasks. comprehensive comparison is needed to guide optimal compression strategy selection. Specifically, we evaluate three categories of LLMs: (1) Small language models (<7B parameters) like Phi-3.5 (Abdin et al., 2024), MiniCPM (Hu et al., 2024), and Megrez (Infinigence, 2024); (2) Standard models (7B-32B parameters) including Qwen2.5, InternLM2.5, and Mistral-7B; and (3) Distilled Reasoning language models like DeepSeek-R1Distilled"

As test-time scaling becomes a pivotal research frontier in Large Language Models (LLMs) development, contemporary and advanced post-training methodologies increasingly focus on extending the generation length of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses to enhance reasoning capabilities toward DeepSeek R1-like performance. However, recent studies reveal a persistent overthinking phenomenon in state-of-the-art reasoning models, manifesting as excessive redundancy or repetitive thinking patterns in long CoT responses. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage reinforcement learning framework for achieving concise reasoning in LLMs, named ConciseR. Specifically, the first stage, using more training steps, aims to incentivize the model's reasoning capabilities via Group Relative Policy Optimization with clip-higher and dynamic sampling components (GRPO++), and the second stage, using fewer training steps, explicitly enforces conciseness and improves efficiency via Length-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (L-GRPO). Significantly, ConciseR only optimizes response length once all rollouts of a sample are correct, following the "walk before you run" principle. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ConciseR model, which generates more concise CoT reasoning responses, outperforms recent state-of-the-art reasoning models with zero RL paradigm across AIME 2024, MATH-500, AMC 2023, Minerva, and Olympiad benchmarks.

Post-training compression reduces the computational and memory costs of large language models (LLMs), enabling resource-efficient deployment. However, existing compression benchmarks only focus on language modeling (e.g., perplexity) and natural language understanding tasks (e.g., GLUE accuracy), ignoring the agentic capabilities - workflow, tool use/function call, long-context understanding and real-world application. We introduce the Agent Compression Benchmark (ACBench), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how compression impacts LLMs' agentic abilities. ACBench spans (1) 12 tasks across 4 capabilities (e.g., WorfBench for workflow generation, Needle-in-Haystack for long-context retrieval), (2) quantization (GPTQ, AWQ) and pruning (Wanda, SparseGPT), and (3) 15 models, including small (Gemma-2B), standard (Qwen2.5 7B-32B), and distilled reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our experiments reveal compression tradeoffs: 4-bit quantization preserves workflow generation and tool use (1%-3% drop) but degrades real-world application accuracy by 10%-15%. We introduce ERank, Top-k Ranking Correlation and Energy to systematize analysis. ACBench provides actionable insights for optimizing LLM compression in agentic scenarios.

ComfyMind, a collaborative AI system built on ComfyUI, enhances generative workflows with a Semantic Workflow Interface and Search Tree Planning mechanism, outperforming existing open-source systems across generation, editing, and reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 With the rapid advancement of generative models, general-purpose generation has gained increasing attention as a promising approach to unify diverse tasks across modalities within a single system. Despite this progress, existing open-source frameworks often remain fragile and struggle to support complex real-world applications due to the lack of structured workflow planning and execution-level feedback. To address these limitations, we present ComfyMind, a collaborative AI system designed to enable robust and scalable general-purpose generation, built on the ComfyUI platform. ComfyMind introduces two core innovations: Semantic Workflow Interface (SWI) that abstracts low-level node graphs into callable functional modules described in natural language, enabling high-level composition and reducing structural errors; Search Tree Planning mechanism with localized feedback execution, which models generation as a hierarchical decision process and allows adaptive correction at each stage. Together, these components improve the stability and flexibility of complex generative workflows. We evaluate ComfyMind on three public benchmarks: ComfyBench, GenEval, and Reason-Edit, which span generation, editing, and reasoning tasks. Results show that ComfyMind consistently outperforms existing open-source baselines and achieves performance comparable to GPT-Image-1. ComfyMind paves a promising path for the development of open-source general-purpose generative AI systems. Project page: https://github.com/LitaoGuo/ComfyMind

AutoRefine, a reinforcement learning framework for large language models, enhances retrieval-augmented reasoning by iteratively refining knowledge and optimizing searches, leading to improved performance in complex question-answering tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but are inherently limited by their knowledge reservoir. Retrieval-augmented reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information, hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new ``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.
