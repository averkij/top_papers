Introduction 5 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 5 3 2 9 1 . 5 0 5 2 : r Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel across diverse tasks but suffer from high inference costs in time and memory. Token sparsity mitigates inefficiencies in token usage, while neuron sparsity reduces high-dimensional computations, both offering promising solutions to enhance efficiency. Recently, these two sparsity paradigms have evolved largely in parallel, fostering the prevailing assumption that they function independently. However, fundamental yet underexplored question remains: Do they truly operate in isolation, or is there deeper underlying interplay that has In this paper, we conyet to be uncovered? duct the first comprehensive investigation into this question. By introducing and analyzing the matching mechanism between Core Neurons and Core Tokens, we found that key neurons and tokens for inference mutually influence and reinforce each other. Building on this insight, we propose CoreMatching, co-adaptive sparse inference framework, which leverages the synergy between token and neuron sparsity to enhance inference efficiency. Through theoretical analysis and efficiency evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-theart baselines on ten image understanding tasks and three hardware devices. Notably, on the NVIDIA Titan Xp, it achieved 5 FLOPs reduction and 10 overall speedup.

Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 Large language models (LLMs) have achieved outstanding performance in various applications and have exerted significant influence on our daily life (Brown, 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a; Kuo et al., 2025; Qinsi et al.). As LLMs become increasingly aware of the physical world, researchers have discovered their potential for understanding visual information (Lin et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024a; 2025b). As result, series of vision-language models (VLMs) such as LLaVA (Liu et al., 2024b), Blip(Li et al., 2022), and Llama(Touvron et al., 2023b) have been introduced, demonstrating impressive performance on tasks like image-based question answering. However, because of the requirement of long image-token inputs, VLMs typically demand more time and memory for inference than LLMs, limiting their practical adoption in real-world scenarios. Token Sparsity, which exploits the high degree of redundancy among image tokens, is promising solution to this challenge(Ye et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024). Researchers have found that VLMs can retain strong performance using as little as 10% of the total tokens. This has led to extensive interest in determining which tokens are essential. For example, PruMerge (Shang et al., 2024) uses the average attention scores between image tokens and text tokens to measure token importance and retains 20% of the tokens with only minor performance loss; FastV (Chen et al., 2025) uses the total attention scores received by other token and finds that more than half of the tokens can be discarded from the second layer. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that most existing methods rely on attention scores as guide for selecting important tokens, but their validity and accuracy have not been thoroughly examined. Another effective approach to accelerating inference is model-internal sparsity, particularly adaptive Neuron Sparsity. It leverages the highly sparse activations in feedforward network (FFN) layers to skip the computation of inactive neurons, thereby reducing the computational in LLMs. For instance, methods such as Dejavu (Liu et al., 2023) and PowerInfer (Song et al., 2023) employ MLPbased predictors to identify which neurons are activated for given input, achieving up to 93% prediction accuracy. FurCoreMatching: Co-adaptive Sparse Inference Framework for Comprehensive Acceleration of Vision-Language Models Figure 1. Schematic diagram of CoreMatching. In the Pre-filling stage, CoreMatching calculates Core Neurons in the FFN block based on the activation. Core Neurons are the most frequently activated group of neurons. Afterwards, CoreMatching matches the neurons activated by different tokens with the core neurons, and selects group of tokens with the largest intersection as the Core Tokens. Only the Core Tokens are passed to the subsequent layers. During the decoding stage, the model only uses Core Neurons for calculations, and there are only core tokens in the kv cache. CoreMatching achieves comprehensive acceleration for inference of VLMs. ther, CoreInfer (Wang et al., 2024) defines core neurons as the subset of neurons most frequently activated by an input sentence, demonstrating that only these core neurons are needed to maintain performance. While neuron sparsity has shown great promise in LLMs, it remains underexplored and underutilized in VLMs. Although both token sparsity and neuron sparsity can individually accelerate the model, each has limitations in practical applications. Token sparsity primarily speeds up the pre-filling stage and can only provide limited acceleration during decoding by reducing key-value operations. In contrast, neuron sparsity primarily accelerates the decoding stage but cannot achieve high speedup ratio in the prefilling stage due to the large number of tokens and the resulting low level of sparsity. Hence, combining these two forms of sparsity is promising approach to achieving comprehensive acceleration. However, an interesting question that has been overlooked in previous work is: What is the relationship between these two sparse spaces? To answer this question, we first experimentally verify the existence of neuron sparsity in VLMs and the effectiveness of core neurons, which are the most important neurons determined by the activation distribution of all input tokens. Furthermore, we investigate the alignment between core neurons and tokens. By analyzing how core neurons influence t"

SATORI decomposes VQA into verifiable stages with explicit rewards to enhance focus on critical regions and reduce policy-gradient variance, achieving significant performance improvements.  					AI-generated summary 				 DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated powerful reasoning capabilities in the text domain through stable reinforcement learning (RL). Recently, in the multimodal domain, works have begun to directly apply RL to generate R1-like free-form reasoning for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. However, multimodal tasks share an intrinsically different nature from textual tasks, which heavily rely on the understanding of the input image to solve the problem. Therefore, such free-form reasoning faces two critical limitations in the VQA task: (1) Extended reasoning chains diffuse visual focus away from task-critical regions, degrading answer accuracy. (2) Unverifiable intermediate steps amplify policy-gradient variance and computational costs overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce SATORI (Spatially Anchored Task Optimization with ReInforcement Learning), which decomposes VQA into three verifiable stages, including global image captioning, region localization, and answer prediction, each supplying explicit reward signals. Furthermore, we also introduce VQA-Verify, a 12k dataset annotated with answer-aligned captions and bounding-boxes to facilitate training. Experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements across seven VQA benchmarks, achieving up to 15.7% improvement in accuracy in accuracy compared to the R1-like baseline. Our analysis of the attention map confirms enhanced focus on critical regions, which brings improvements in accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/justairr/SATORI-R1.

Therefore, such free-form reasoning faces two critical limitations in the VQA task: (1) Extended reasoning chains diffuse visual focus away from task-critical regions, degrading answer accuracy. (2) Unverifiable intermediate steps amplify policy-gradient variance and computational costs overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce SATORI (Spatially Anchored Task Optimization with ReInforcement Learning), which decomposes VQA into three verifiable stages, including global image captioning, region localization, and answer prediction, each supplying explicit reward signals. Furthermore, we also introduce VQA-Verify, a 12k dataset annotated with answer-aligned captions and bounding-boxes to facilitate training. Experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements across seven VQA benchmarks, achieving up to 15.7% improvement in accuracy in accuracy compared to the R1-like baseline. Our analysis of the attention map confirms enhanced focus on critical regions, which brings improvements in accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/justairr/SATORI-R1."

Post Hoc Registers, a self-distillation method, integrates registers into pre-trained Vision Transformers to reduce artifact tokens, enhancing segmentation and depth prediction.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for visual processing tasks, demonstrating excellent scalability with increased training data and model size. However, recent work has identified the emergence of artifact tokens in ViTs that are incongruous with the local semantics. These anomalous tokens degrade ViT performance in tasks that require fine-grained localization or structural coherence. An effective mitigation of this issue is to the addition of register tokens to ViTs, which implicitly "absorb" the artifact term during training. Given the availability of various large-scale pre-trained ViTs, in this paper we aim at equipping them with such register tokens without the need of re-training them from scratch, which is infeasible considering their size. Specifically, we propose Post Hoc Registers (PH-Reg), an efficient self-distillation method that integrates registers into an existing ViT without requiring additional labeled data and full retraining. PH-Reg initializes both teacher and student networks from the same pre-trained ViT. The teacher remains frozen and unmodified, while the student is augmented with randomly initialized register tokens. By applying test-time augmentation to the teacher's inputs, we generate denoised dense embeddings free of artifacts, which are then used to optimize only a small subset of unlocked student weights. We show that our approach can effectively reduce the number of artifact tokens, improving the segmentation and depth prediction of the student ViT under zero-shot and linear probing.

A four-stage QA task modification, inspired by Dual Process Theory, improves the accuracy of LLMs in math and coding by separating intuition and deliberation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent studies show that the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be improved by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to question-answering (QA) tasks in areas such as math and coding. With a long context length, LLMs may learn to perform search, as indicated by the self-correction behavior observed in DeepSeek R1. However, this search behavior is often imprecise and lacks confidence, resulting in long, redundant responses and highlighting deficiencies in intuition and verification. Inspired by the Dual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA task that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within a strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial response; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more deliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the previous stage into precise steps. Our proposed task improves average accuracy from 24.9% to 27.9% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 49.8% for DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone achieves 26.8% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial inference efficiency gains. These findings suggest that intuition and deliberative reasoning are distinct, complementary systems benefiting from targeted training.

AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel across diverse tasks but suffer from high inference costs in time and memory. Token sparsity mitigates inefficiencies in token usage, while neuron sparsity reduces high-dimensional computations, both offering promising solutions to enhance efficiency. Recently, these two sparsity paradigms have evolved largely in parallel, fostering the prevailing assumption that they function independently. However, a fundamental yet underexplored question remains: Do they truly operate in isolation, or is there a deeper underlying interplay that has yet to be uncovered? In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive investigation into this question. By introducing and analyzing the matching mechanism between Core Neurons and Core Tokens, we found that key neurons and tokens for inference mutually influence and reinforce each other. Building on this insight, we propose CoreMatching, a co-adaptive sparse inference framework, which leverages the synergy between token and neuron sparsity to enhance inference efficiency. Through theoretical analysis and efficiency evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on ten image understanding tasks and three hardware devices. Notably, on the NVIDIA Titan Xp, it achieved 5x FLOPs reduction and a 10x overall speedup. Code is released at https://github.com/wangqinsi1/2025-ICML-CoreMatching/tree/main.
