MusiXQA features high-quality synthetic music sheets generated via MusiXTeX, with structured annotations covering note pitch and duration, chords, clefs, key/time signatures, and text, enabling diverse visual QA tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we reveal significant limitations of current state-of-the-art MLLMs in this domain. Beyond benchmarking, we developed Phi-3-MusiX, an MLLM fine-tuned on our dataset, achieving significant performance gains over GPT-based methods. The proposed dataset and model establish a foundation for future advances in MLLMs for music sheet understanding. Code, data, and model will be released upon acceptance.

Датасет содержит синтетические нотные листы с аннотациями, охватывающими различные аспекты музыкальной нотации. Авторы выявили значительные ограничения современных MLLM в этой области. Они также разработали модель Phi-3-MusiX, специально настроенную на этом датасете, которая показала существенное улучшение производительности по сравнению с методами на основе GPT.",
