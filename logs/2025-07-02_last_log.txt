Figure 1: We present Radial Attention, sparse attention mechanism with O(n log n) computational complexity. Radial Attention accelerates pre-trained HunyuanVideo [1] by 1.9 at its default video length while maintaining comparable video quality. When generating 4 longer videos, it reduces tuning costs by up to 4.4 and speeds up inference by up to 3.7 versus dense attention.Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we identify phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, scalable sparse attention mechanism with O(n log n) complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard O(n2) dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size indicates equal contributions. Preprint. Under review. shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to 1.9 speedup over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video generation up to 4 longer while reducing training costs by up to 4.4 compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to 3.7 compared to dense attention inference.Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images [2, 3]. Recent advances have extended their capabilities to video generation, producing visually compelling and temporally coherent results [4, 5, 6, 7, 1]. However, these improvements come at significant computational cost. Unlike image generation, video synthesis involves an additional temporal dimension, dramatically increasing the number of tokens to process. As self attention scales quadratically with sequence length, training and inference on long videos become prohibitively expensive, limiting model practicality and scalability. Figure 2: Radial Attention reduces the computational complexity of attention from O(n2) to O(n log n). When generating 500-frame 720p video with HunyuanVideo, it reduces the attention computation by 9, achieves 3.7 speedup, and saves 4.6 tuning costs. Several prior works have sought to mitigate this challenge using sparse attention. For instance, as illustrated in Figure 3(a), Sparse VideoGen (SVG) [8] employs an online profiling strategy that classifies each attention head as either spatial or temporal and then applies the corresponding sparse mask. While this approach can accelerate inference, it poses challenges during training, especially for longer videos. The profiling may misclassify attention heads on unseen data distributions, and such errors can be reinforced during optimization, leading to degraded performance. Other approaches replace the softmax attention with linear alternatives [9, 10]; however, these typically require substantial architectural modifications, where modest fine-tuning is typically insufficient to recover the original video quality. In physics, it is well known that signals and waves naturally experience energy decay as they propagate through space and time. Inspired by this principle, we observe similar phenomenon in attention: post-softmax attention scores between token pairs tend to diminish as their spatial or temporal distance increases (see Figure 4(b)). We term this phenomenon Spatiotemporal Energy Decay and model the decay as an exponential function of both spatial and temporal distances. Based on this model, we unify spatial and temporal attention heads in SVG [8] into Radial Attention, scalable sparse attention mechanism with O(n log n) computational complexity (see Figure 2). Radial Attention employs static sparse attention mask to translate the concept of energy decay into corresponding computation density decay. The mask design is simple yet effective: each token attends to others at similar spatial locations, while the attention window shrinks exponentially with temporal distance, as illustrated in Figure 3(b). Moreover, since Radial Attention only prunes unimportant token relations without modifying the underlying softmax attention mechanism, it enables efficient adaptation of pre-trained video diffusion models to longer sequences using lightweight fine-tuning, such as LoRA [11]. Compared to fullparameter fine-tuning with dense attention, it achieves better video quality, as LoRA focuses on updating parameters most critical for temporal coherence and visual fidelity. The length-extension LoRA is also compatible with existing style LoRAs (see Section 5.2). When generating videos at the default length, Radial Attention accelerates leading video diffusion models of Wan2.1-14B [7], HunyuanVideo [1] by up to 1.9 speedup. When generating 4 longer videos, Radial Attention reduces tuning costs by up to 4.4 and accelerates inference by up to 3.7 without sacrificing quality. Some visual examples on HunyuanVideo can be found in Figure 1. 2 Figure 3: Attention pipelines of SVG [8] and our Radial Attention. Softmax is omitted for clarity. (a) SVG dynamically selects either spatial or temporal attention for each head to speed up inference. However, it does not overcome the original models length limitation and cannot be trained on unseen distributions like longer videos. (b) Our Radial Attention uses static mask that unifies spatial and temporal attention with O(n log n) computational complexity. This static design enables efficient longer-video adaptation.Video d"
