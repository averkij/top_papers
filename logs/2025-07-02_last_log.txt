We discuss generalization strategies, including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular, interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning, and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI, advocating for systems that are not only intelligent but also transparent, value-aligned, and socially grounded. We anticipate that this paper will serve as foundational reference for researchers building the next generation of general-purpose human-level machine intelligence. eywords Artificial General Intelligence, Multi-Agents Systems, Cognitive Functions, Large Language Models, Vision-Language Models, Large Vision Models, Foundation Models, Human Brain, Robotics, Psychology, Agents, Agentic AI, World Model Equal Contribution Corresponding author: shaina.raza@torontomu.ca 1 Center for research in Computer Vision, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA. 2 Cornell University, Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA 3 Department of Electronics Engineering, Mehran University of Engineering & Technology, Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan. 4Department of Imaging Physics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. 5 Intelligent Transportation Systems, University of Tennessee, Oakridge, TN, USA. 6 Department of Electrical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, SAR China. 7 Department of Mechanical Engineering, Bartin University, Bartin Turkey. 8 Vector Institute, Toronto Canada. 9 Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK. 10 Center for Data Science, New York University, NYU, NY, USA. 11 Meta Research (Work done outside Meta). 12 Amazon Research (Work done outside Amazon). 13 Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK. 14 Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research and Optimization, Torrens University Australia, Fortitude Valley, Brisbane, QLD 4006, Australia, 15 University Research and Innovation Center, Obuda University, 1034 Budapest, Hungary1 Introduction 2 Historical Evolution of AI 2.1 2.2 Overview of AGI . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

SciArena is a community-driven platform for evaluating foundation models on scientific literature tasks, using collective voter judgments to rank models and address the need for reliable automated evaluation.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present SciArena, an open and collaborative platform for evaluating foundation models on scientific literature tasks. Unlike traditional benchmarks for scientific literature understanding and synthesis, SciArena engages the research community directly, following the Chatbot Arena evaluation approach of community voting on model comparisons. By leveraging collective intelligence, SciArena offers a community-driven evaluation of model performance on open-ended scientific tasks that demand literature-grounded, long-form responses. The platform currently supports 23 open-source and proprietary foundation models and has collected over 13,000 votes from trusted researchers across diverse scientific domains. We analyze the data collected so far and confirm that the submitted questions are diverse, aligned with real-world literature needs, and that participating researchers demonstrate strong self-consistency and inter-annotator agreement in their evaluations. We discuss the results and insights based on the model ranking leaderboard. To further promote research in building model-based automated evaluation systems for literature tasks, we release SciArena-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark based on our collected preference data. The benchmark measures the accuracy of models in judging answer quality by comparing their pairwise assessments with human votes. Our experiments highlight the benchmark's challenges and emphasize the need for more reliable automated evaluation methods.

"SciArena is a community-driven platform for evaluating foundation models on scientific literature tasks, using collective voter judgments to rank models and address the need for reliable automated evaluation.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present SciArena, an open and collaborative platform for evaluating foundation models on scientific literature tasks. Unlike traditional benchmarks for scientific literature understanding and synthesis, SciArena engages the research community directly, following the Chatbot Arena evaluation approach of community voting on model comparisons. By leveraging collective intelligence, SciArena offers a community-driven evaluation of model performance on open-ended scientific tasks that demand literature-grounded, long-form responses. The platform currently supports 23 open-source and proprietary foundation models and has collected over 13,000 votes from trusted researchers across diverse scientific domains. We analyze the data collected so far and confirm that the submitted questions are diverse, aligned with real-world literature needs, and that participating researchers demonstrate strong self-consistency and inter-annotator agreement in their evaluations. We discuss the results and insights based on the model ranking leaderboard. To further promote research in building model-based automated evaluation systems for literature tasks, we release SciArena-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark based on our collected preference data. The benchmark measures the accuracy of models in judging answer quality by comparing their pairwise assessments with human votes. Our experiments highlight the benchmark's challenges and emphasize the need for more reliable automated evaluation methods."

The paper synthesizes the interdisciplinary approach to achieving Artificial General Intelligence, emphasizing modular reasoning, memory, multi-agent coordination, and the integration of neurosymbolic systems and reinforcement learning to overcome current model limitations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models, and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies, including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular, interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning, and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.

Diffusion large language models are applied to code generation, revealing their unique denoising processes and benefiting from a novel reinforcement learning sampling scheme.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to autoregressive (AR) models because their denoising models operate over the entire sequence. The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, DiffuCoder, on 130B tokens of code. Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts. For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and maintain training efficiency, we propose coupled-GRPO, a novel sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and reduces reliance on AR causal during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native RL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder.

PECCAVI is a robust image watermarking technique that is resistant to visual paraphrase attacks and distortions, utilizing NMPs and multi-channel frequency domain watermarking.  					AI-generated summary 				 A report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency predicts that by 2026, up to 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated, raising concerns among policymakers, who cautioned that "Generative AI could act as a force multiplier for political disinformation. The combined effect of generative text, images, videos, and audio may surpass the influence of any single modality." In response, California's Bill AB 3211 mandates the watermarking of AI-generated images, videos, and audio. However, concerns remain regarding the vulnerability of invisible watermarking techniques to tampering and the potential for malicious actors to bypass them entirely. Generative AI-powered de-watermarking attacks, especially the newly introduced visual paraphrase attack, have shown an ability to fully remove watermarks, resulting in a paraphrase of the original image. This paper introduces PECCAVI, the first visual paraphrase attack-safe and distortion-free image watermarking technique. In visual paraphrase attacks, an image is altered while preserving its core semantic regions, termed Non-Melting Points (NMPs). PECCAVI strategically embeds watermarks within these NMPs and employs multi-channel frequency domain watermarking. It also incorporates noisy burnishing to counter reverse-engineering efforts aimed at locating NMPs to disrupt the embedded watermark, thereby enhancing durability. PECCAVI is model-agnostic. All relevant resources and codes will be open-sourced.
