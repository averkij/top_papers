It also supports coherent multi-prompt video generation with smooth scene transitions and enables controllable video generation using long depth or pose sequences. Additional results and details are available on the project website: https://freelongvideo.github.io/ Index TermsVideo Generation, Diffusion Models, Multimodal LearningRecent advances in video generation models [1][14], have enabled the generation of high-quality short videos from text prompts. These models are typically trained on large-scale video-text datasets [15][21], and their ability to produce coherent short clips has inspired research into extending them to long-form video generation [17], [22][33]. Yet, building long-video generation models requires extensive computational resources and access to large-scale longvideo annotations, making them impractical for lightweight and general applications. more efficient and practical alternative is to adapt pretrained short video generation models to generate longer video sequences in training-free manner. Recent studies [34][42] have explored attention mechanisms [34], [37], [40], auto-regressive architectures [36], [42], and positional encoding [38] to improve long-range consistency in video clips. However, these approaches often focus on maintaining coherence at the boundaries of adjacent clips rather than enforcing unified narrative or consistent visual identity across the entire video. As result, artifacts such as identity drift, inconsistent lighting, and abrupt scene transitions can emerge, particularly in videos with prolonged durations or complex motion dynamics. In this study, we propose straightforward, training-free method to adapt existing short video generation models for generating consistent longer videos. We first evaluate the direct application of short video generators, such as Wan2.1 [1] (native length 81 frames), to longer sequences (e.g., 4 video Y. Lu, and Y. Yang are with ReLER, CCAI, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China (e-mail: {aniki.yulu, yangyics}@zju.edu.cn). length, 324 frames). As shown in Figure 1, this approach ensures global consistency but results in lower-quality outputs, including blurred textures, and motion jitter beyond the models native frame length (see the first and second row of Figure 1). To understand these issues, we performed frequency analysis on generated long videos. Frequency analysis of generated longer videos revealed stable low-frequency components but significant distortion in high-frequency components as video length increased (Figure 2). In fine-grained frequency analysis, we also observe increasing distortion in high-frequency components as video length grows (see Figure 4(a)). For example, with double-length sequences, only 30% of the low-frequency content available, leaving 70% of high-frequency components distorted; at 4 length, distortion rises to 95% (Figure 4 (b)). This diminishes fine details in longer sequences, such as cat fur or tree leaves becoming blurred (Figure 1, second row). In this paper, we introduce FreeLong, novel framework that employs SpectralBlend Attention to balance the frequency distribution of long video features in the denoising process. FreeLong integrates global and local features via two parallel streams, enhancing the fidelity and consistency of long video generation. The global stream deals with the entire video sequence, capturing extensive dependencies and themes for narrative continuity. Meanwhile, the local stream focuses on shorter frame subsequences to retain fine details and smooth transitions, preserving high-frequency spatial and temporal information. FreeLong combines global and local video features in the frequency domain, improving both consistency and fidelity by blend5 2 0 2 0 3 ] .

The first row of each case shows short videos generated using short video diffusion models (81 frames for Wan-2.1 [1] and 121 frames for LTX-Video [2]). Directly extending these models to longer videos, like those with 4 (324 frames and 484 frames), preserves temporal consistency but lacks fine spatial-temporal details. In contrast, our proposed FreeLong and FreeLong++ adapts short video diffusion models to create consistent long videos with high fidelity.
