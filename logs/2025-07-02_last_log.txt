Index Terms Appearance modeling, frequency-aware methods, material reconstruction, material editing 1. INTRODUCTION Material properties play crucial role in visual computing, serving as fundamental component in applications such as rendering, augmented reality, and scene understanding [1]. This is usually realized through the modeling and reconstruction of the bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) [2], which describe the relationship between the incident and outgoing radiances for specific material. By capturing the complex interactions of light with different surfaces, material representations enhance the realism and fidelity of synthesized images, improving the overall visual quality in various computational applications. Data-driven BRDF models [3], which map spatial coordinates to reflected light distributions, have demonstrated high fidelity in capturing complex material appearances. However, their inherently large data size poses significant challenges for downstream tasks such as material reconstruction, editing, storage, and real-time rendering. Efficiently representing and reconstructing BRDF data still remains critical issue. Implicit neural BRDF models (e.g., NBRDFs [4, 1, 5]) offer promising solution to these challenges by incorporating neural networks into the BRDF modeling pipeline, providing more scalable and adaptive solution for material representation. Based on NBRDF, recent research has explored leveraging latent space representations through an encoder-decoder architecture [6]. This approach seeks to reconstruct BRDFs from compressed latent space, reducing memory requirements while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. However, the behavior of material representations in the frequency domain remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we propose FreNBRDF, frequency-rectified neural material representation. By leveraging spherical harmonics, we integrate frequency rectification [7] into the NBRDF framework and introduce novel frequency-rectified loss to achieve more structured and accurate representation of material appearance. The primary contributions of this work are: method for extracting frequency information from neural materials using spherical harmonics; and generalizable and adaptive material reconstruction and editing framework based on an autoencoder architecture, incorporating frequency rectification and achieving stateof-the-art performance. 2. RELATED WORK Material acquisition Gonio-photometers [8] are widely used for measuring retro-reflection, enabling precise characterization of material appearance. Using this technique, RGL [9] captured 62 materials, including anisotropic ones. In contrast, image-based measurement devices [10] were used to construct the MERL dataset [3], which consists of 100 isotropic materials. Similarly, digital consumer cameras have been employed for texture acquisition [11], forming the bidirectional texture function database Bonn (BTFDBB) using 151 such cameras mounted on structured rack. Material modeling Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) [2] are widely adopted for material modeling. Early BRDF models [12, 13, 14] introduced analytical expressions derived from empirical observations. Other models [15, 16, 17] incorporate physical scattering principles while maintaining artist-friendly parameterization. These models offer balance between realism and efficiency, as their limited set of tunable parameters can be fitted to measured material data [17], making them computationally efficient in terms of both time and memory. However, due to inherent model approximations, many analytical BRDFs struggle to capture complex reflectance behaviors, particularly for highly detailed or anisotropic materials [4]. Neural BRDFs Data-driven material representations (e.g., MERL [3]) produce highly realistic renderings compared to analytical models. However, their large data size presents significant challenge for real-world applications. To address this, compression techniques such as dimensionality reduction [18] or neural network-based compression [4, 6] are commonly used. Among these, neural BRDFs (NBRDFs) [4] offer compelling balance of high fidelity and low memory demand, making them an efficient latent representation for various tasks. Built upon this, recent research has introduced set encoder hypernetwork [6] that enables generalizable and adaptive BRDF reconstruction from sparse samples. This approach is designed to handle unseen data while accommodating varying sample sizes, making it flexible and scalable solution. Building on this work, we further explore neural BRDF representations within the frequency domain. Frequency rectification FrePolad [7] utilizes spherical harmonics [19] to extract frequency information from point clouds, improving the quality and diversity of point cloud generation while maintaining high computational efficiency. Inspired by this approach, we integrate frequency information into the NBRDF representation, aiming to enh"

Accurate material modeling is crucial for achieving photorealistic rendering, bridging the gap between computer-generated imagery and real-world photographs. While traditional approaches rely on tabulated BRDF data, recent work has shifted towards implicit neural representations, which offer compact and flexible frameworks for a range of tasks. However, their behavior in the frequency domain remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce FreNBRDF, a frequency-rectified neural material representation. By leveraging spherical harmonics, we integrate frequency-domain considerations into neural BRDF modeling. We propose a novel frequency-rectified loss, derived from a frequency analysis of neural materials, and incorporate it into a generalizable and adaptive reconstruction and editing pipeline. This framework enhances fidelity, adaptability, and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \ours improves the accuracy and robustness of material appearance reconstruction and editing compared to state-of-the-art baselines, enabling more structured and interpretable downstream tasks and applications.
