Text:"Yalun Dai Yangyu Huang Xin Zhang Wenshan Wu Chong Li Wenhui Lu Shijie Cao Li Dong Scarlett LiData is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by selecting minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data filtering, sampling, and selection play crucial role in this area. To complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively underexplored. This work introduces general paradigm, DELT, for considering data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data Selection, and Data Ordering. Data Scoring assigns score for each data sample based on its properties, such as quality, difficulty, and learnability. Data Selection optionally selects subset from the original training data based on the scores. Data Ordering utilizes these scores to organize the training data in new, optimized order, rather than the traditional random shuffling. Furthermore, we design Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as new instance of Data Scoring, which considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly, different DELT instances enhance LM performance to varying degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and FO for data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection. Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is promising foundational area in LM training.

High performance at the same selection ratio indicates high efficacy, while achieving similar performance with smaller selection ratio demonstrates high efficiency. Our method excels in both efficacy and efficiency. Corresponding author Preprint. Under review.The significance of language models [1, 2, 3] is immense in modern computational applications. From natural language processing tasks such as translation [4] and sentiment analysis [5] to more complex applications like automated reasoning [6] and conversational agents [7], language models have revolutionized the way machines understand, generate, and interact with human beings using natural language. To empower language models having these abilities, data is central to their training and serves as the foundation from which models learn knowledge based on linguistic patterns and structures. Consequently, meticulous data curation is essential to ensure consistently high model performance across various applications. Recent research has therefore concentrated on data efficiency, selecting the smallest or highestquality subset of the corpus that still yields strong results [8, 9, 10]. Once that subset is chosen, however, every surviving sample is ordinarily treated the same, and the order in which samples are shown to the model is random. In this work, we define data efficacy as improving model performance by optimizing the organization of training data. This area complements data efficacy and is still in its early stage, with its potential demonstrated through curriculum learning [11, 12] that feeds examples to model from easy to hard. In this context, we notice that the latest generation of language models [13, 3, 14] typically trains for only few epochs, usually just one, due to the vast scale of training datasets but limited computing power. These models contrast with previous generations [15, 16] by the scaling law [17], which trained over many epochs and often led to overfitting. This aligns with the findings of QQT [18], which shows that high-quality data quickly loses its utility after being used repeatedly. In other words, it is more effective to utilize large amount of training data with few epochs rather than rely on high-quality data with many epochs. Consequently, effectively organizing the training dataset is essential for enhancing the performance of language models trained with only few epochs. Expanding on this insight, we propose general paradigm for data efficacy that achieves benefits without altering the dataset content and the model architecture, which makes it an almost cost-free approach. Specifically, this paradigm incorporates data scoring, data selection, and data ordering components. Data scoring assigns score to each sample, which reflects factors like difficulty, quality, diversity, and learnability. Data selection involves optionally choosing subset of the original training data based on these scores. Data ordering then organizes the training data according to these scores, either in ascending, descending, or other arrangements. Curriculum learning [11, 12] can be viewed as specific example within our paradigm, with ascending ordering based on difficulty scoring. To verify the proposed paradigm, we integrate some baseline methods into it and also design new methods respectively for data scoring and ordering. The key results from Figure 1 highlight that the proposed DELT significantly improves data efficacy in LM training on set of typical benchmarks. Meanwhile, it outperforms existing methods [10, 19] in data efficiency that further boosts LM performance across all selection ratios. The main contributions of this paper are as below: We identified the potential of the underexplored area, data efficacy, in language model training and proposed general paradigm for this area, DELT, which consists of data scoring, data selection, and data ordering. We designed an innovative method for data scoring, called Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), which evaluates the score for each data sample based on learnability and quality from the gradient consistency perspective. We devised novel method for data ordering, named Folding Ordering (FO), which optimizes LM training and mitigates the issues of model forgetting and data distributio"

"DELT, a paradigm for enhancing language model performance through data efficacy, consists of data scoring, selection, and ordering, demonstrating significant improvements without increasing data scale or model size.  					AI-generated summary 				 Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly, various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection. Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM training."
