Text:"5 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 5 8 6 8 0 . 4 0 5 2 : r Seaweed-7B: Cost-Effective Training of Video Generation Foundation Model ByteDance Seed1 1ByteDanceThis technical report presents cost-efficient strategy for training video generation foundation model. We present mid-sized research model with approximately 7 billion parameters (7B) called Seaweed-7B trained from scratch using 665,000 H100 GPU hours. Despite being trained with moderate computational resources, Seaweed-7B demonstrates highly competitive performance compared to contemporary video generation models of much larger size. Design choices are especially crucial in resource-constrained setting. This technical report highlights the key design decisions that enhance the performance of the medium-sized diffusion model. Empirically, we make two observations: (1) Seaweed-7B achieves performance comparable to, or even surpasses, larger models trained on substantially greater GPU resources, and (2) our model, which exhibits strong generalization ability, can be effectively adapted across wide range of downstream applications either by lightweight fine-tuning or continue training. Date: March 02, 2025 Project Page: https://seaweed.video/Foundation models serve as the cornerstone of modern machine learning. These models typically contain massive number of parameters and are trained on vast amounts of data, allowing them to demonstrate strong generalization capabilities and adapt to diverse range of downstream tasks. Examples include large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing [9, 14], vision language models for image/video understanding [4, 66], and audio foundation models for speech synthesis and recognition [8, 68]. This paper focuses on the foundation model for video generation, compelling research area driven by the central role of video as dominant medium in digital entertainment, communication, and real-world simulation. The video generation model plays pivotal role, as advancements in this foundation can broadly enhance performance across range of downstream video applications such as image animation [13, 39], video editing [1], and video storytelling [26, 90]. Video generation models have seen rapid advancements in the past few years. Recent reports present various methods for training video generation models from scratch, such as MovieGen [65], Cosmos [3], and Wan2.1 [77], among many others. These approaches exhibit consistent pattern, utilizing diffusion transformers (DiT) [21, 62] and adhering to the trend of scaling the model size, along with the GPU resources, to improve performance. Scaling up DiT models holds promise, but its training demands massive GPU cost. For example, MovieGen uses 6,000+ NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Such demands can significantly impede innovation in video generation models. 1 Beyond the high training costs, inference in video generation remains exceptionally expensive which is often orders of magnitude more than language, image, or audio generation. For many applications, such as those in social media like Instagram and YouTube Shorts, inference may be constrained by GPU memory and the high serving costs. As result, the substantial training and inference expenses tend to favor small to medium-sized models, which offer better cost efficiency for both training and inference. Fortunately, the language model community has discovered that small to medium-sized models can match or even surpass large language models (LLMs) through architectural improvements and optimized training strategies [36, 49]. For instance, Mistral 7B outperforms Llama2 13B across benchmarks [36]. DeepSeek v3 [49] demonstrates that 37B-parameter activation model can surpass 72B and 420B dense models, requiring only fraction of GPU resources. This efficiency is achieved through key designs such as enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), and the use of high-quality training data. In video generation, however, few studies have investigated similar scaling efficiencies1. Although earlier works have explored training small models [46, 99] with minimal GPU resources, their impact remains limited due to significant quality gap between their generated videos and those by contemporary state-of-the-art models. This technical report discusses cost-efficient strategy for training video generation foundation model. We choose to train moderately sized model with FLOPs optimized for deployment on single GPU, namely Seaweed-7B (short for Seed Video), which consists of DiT with approximately 7 billion parameters. We train the model from scratch using 665,000 H100 GPU hours, equivalent to 27.7 days of training on 1,000 H100 GPUs. Fortuitously, we have trained versions of the model with similar model sizes and GPU resources. This allows us to carry out meaningful comparisons of their design differences. Our findings indicate the critical impact of design choices in this resource-constrained setting, particularly in data curation, model design, and training strategy and optimization. To validate the performance of Seaweed-7B as foundational model for video generation, we conduct experiments evaluating two hallmark capabilities of foundation models as discussed in [7]: generic generation capability and downstream task generalization. First, we evaluate two primary tasks, i.e., text-to-video and image-to-video generation, to assess generation quality in terms of fidelity, aesthetics, motion quality, prompt alignment, and inference efficiency. Our results show that Seaweed-7B matches or even surpasses some significantly larger models trained with greater computational resources, showcasing its highly competitive performance. Second, we perform qualitative analysis of adapting Seaweed-7B across variety of video generation tasks. The results demonstrate that Seaweed-7B can be effectively applied to broad range of downstream applications, either by lightweight fine-tuning or continue training (see Section 5). Our experimental results suggest that the potential of medium-sized DiT model, such as those with 7 billion parameters, remains largely underexplored. Given their cost-efficiency advantages in both training and inference, we hope future research will continue to optimize medium-sized models. The structure of this paper is as follows. Since previous works have extensively detailed video generation model designs, this paper focuses on key design choices that complement or enhance existing findings in the literature. In summ"

Top: FlexIP showcases versatility and precision in personalized image generation.

Bottom: FlexIPs dynamic weight gating mechanism smoothly transitions between strong identity preservation and diverse personalization, significantly outperforming IP-Adapter, which suffers from abrupt identity shifts and rigid control. This reflects superior flexibility and user-friendly controllability. Equal contribution.With the rapid advancement of 2D generative models, preserving subject identity while enabling diverse editing has emerged as critical research focus. Existing methods typically face inherent trade-offs between identity preservation and personalized manipulation. We introduce FlexIP, novel framework that decouples these objectives through two dedicated components: Personalization Adapter for stylistic manipulation and Preservation Adapter for identity maintenance. By explicitly injecting both control mechanisms into the generative model, our framework enables flexible parameterized control during inference through dynamic tuning of the weight adapter. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach breaks through the performance limitations of conventional methods, achieving superior identity preservation while supporting more diverse personalized generation capabilities (Project Page). 1. Introduction The swift progress of 2D diffusion models [40, 62] has propelled ongoing advancements in image synthesis [35] and editing technologies [4]. These models demonstrate remarkable abilities to generate high-quality and diverse visual content from textual or visual input, showing immense potential in artistic creation and advertising design. Current research in subject-driven image generation primarily follows two paradigms: inference-time fine-tuning and zero-shot image-based customization. The fine-tuning approach [11, 43, 44] learns pseudo-words as compact subject representations, requiring per-subject optimization. While this achieves high-fidelity reconstruction, it inherently sacrifices editing flexibility due to overfitting on narrow feature manifolds. In contrast, zero-shot methods [8, 30, 64] leverage cross-modal alignment modules trained without subject-specific fine-tuning, achieving greater editing flexibility but often compromising identity integrity. Fundamentally, existing methods treat identity preservation and editing personalization as inherently conflicting objectives, forcing models to make implicit trade-offs. We identify critical limitation in existing zero-shot methods: they often adopt alignment modules similar to the Q-former [1, 22] from vision-language models (VLMs) to align image-text modalities. While effective in visual understanding for text generation, such modules become insufficient for image generation tasks, as they require capturing broader and more complex visual knowledge. This image-text misalignment results in identity preservation and editorial fidelity not working harmoniously together. Therefore, more explicit decomposition of visual and textual information is necessaryassigning images to handle identity preservation and texts to guide personalization instructions. Separating these information flows enables each modality to specialize, fostering stronger complementarity and achieving superior cross-modal alignment. To address these issues, we propose FlexIP, the first framework to explicitly decouple identity preservation and personalized editing into independently controllable dimenInspired by the principle of low coupling, high sions. cohesion, we introduce dual-adapter architecture, enabling each adapter to focus clearly and independently on its specific taskidentity preservation or personalized editingthus maximizing their complementary strengths. Specifically, the preservation adapter captures essential identity details by retrieving both high-level semantic concepts and low-level spatial details through cross-attention layers. Intuitively, this approach resembles recognizing person not just by general descriptors (e.g., age or contour) but also by detailed visual cues (e.g., facial features or hairstyle), thereby robustly preserving their identity even under diverse edits. On the other hand, the personalization adapter interacts with the text instructions and high-level semantic concepts. The text instructions provide editing flexibility, while the high-level semantic concepts ensure identity preservation. By separating identity and personalization feature flows, our design eliminates feature competition found in traditional single-path approaches, enabling explicit decoupling of what to preserve and how to edit. As illustrated in Fig. 1 bottom, by changing preservation scale, existing methods produce abrupt transitions between identity preservation and personalization, making precise control challenging. Motivated by this, we aim to achieve an explicit control between identity preservation and personalization, and thus introduce dynamic weight gating mechanism that interpolates between two complementary adapters during inference. Users can continuously adjust adapter contributions, flexibly balancing preservation and personalization (Fig. 1 bottom). Our empirical analysis reveals critical dependency between training data modality and adapter efficacy: video-frame training pairs inherently capture temporal deformations (e.g., pose variations, lighting changes), enabling flexible feature disentanglement, whereas static image pairs tend to induce copy-paste artifacts due to overfitting on rigid spatial correlations. To mitigate this, we implement modality-aware weighting strategy: preservation adapter dominance (higher preservation weight) for image-trained scenarios, enforcing strict identity consistency through feature locking in cross-attention maps. Personalization adapter dominance (higher personalization style) for video-trained scenarios, leveraging temporal coherence to guide structurally coherent deformations. The adapters govern distinct aspects of the generation process: This dynamic weight gating mechanism transforms the traditionally binary preservation-edit trad"

We propose a new problem, In-2-4D, for generative 4D (i.e., 3D + motion) inbetweening from a minimalistic input setting: two single-view images capturing an object in two distinct motion states. Given two images representing the start and end states of an object in motion, our goal is to generate and reconstruct the motion in 4D. We utilize a video interpolation model to predict the motion, but large frame-to-frame motions can lead to ambiguous interpretations. To overcome this, we employ a hierarchical approach to identify keyframes that are visually close to the input states and show significant motion, then generate smooth fragments between them. For each fragment, we construct the 3D representation of the keyframe using Gaussian Splatting. The temporal frames within the fragment guide the motion, enabling their transformation into dynamic Gaussians through a deformation field. To improve temporal consistency and refine 3D motion, we expand the self-attention of multi-view diffusion across timesteps and apply rigid transformation regularization. Finally, we merge the independently generated 3D motion segments by interpolating boundary deformation fields and optimizing them to align with the guiding video, ensuring smooth and flicker-free transitions. Through extensive qualitative and quantitiave experiments as well as a user study, we show the effectiveness of our method and its components.

With the rapid advancement of 2D generative models, preserving subject identity while enabling diverse editing has emerged as a critical research focus. Existing methods typically face inherent trade-offs between identity preservation and personalized manipulation. We introduce FlexIP, a novel framework that decouples these objectives through two dedicated components: a Personalization Adapter for stylistic manipulation and a Preservation Adapter for identity maintenance. By explicitly injecting both control mechanisms into the generative model, our framework enables flexible parameterized control during inference through dynamic tuning of the weight adapter. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach breaks through the performance limitations of conventional methods, achieving superior identity preservation while supporting more diverse personalized generation capabilities (Project Page: https://flexip-tech.github.io/flexip/).
