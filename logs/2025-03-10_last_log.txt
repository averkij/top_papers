[ 1 6 3 2 5 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r aYibin Wang 1,2 Yuhang Zang 3 Hao Li 1,2,4 Cheng Jin 1 Jiaqi Wang 2,Recent advances in human preference alignment have significantly enhanced multimodal generation and understanding. key approach is training reward models to guide preference optimization. However, existing models are often task-specific, limiting their adaptability across diverse visual applications. We also argue that jointly learning to assess multiple tasks may foster synergistic effect, where improved image understanding enhances image generation assessment, and refined image evaluation benefits video assessment through better frame analysis. To this end, this paper proposes UNIFIEDREWARD, the first unified reward model for multimodal understanding and generation assessment, enabling both pairwise ranking and pointwise scoring, which can be employed for vision model preference alignment. Specifically, (1) we first develop UNIFIEDREWARD on our constructed large-scale human preference dataset, including both image and video generation/understanding tasks. (2) Then, it is utilized to automatically construct high-quality preference pair data based on the vision models, fine-gradually filtering their outputs through pair ranking and point sifting. (3) Finally, these data are used for their preference alignment through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results demonstrate that joint learning to assess diverse visual tasks can lead to substantial mutual benefits and we apply our pipeline to both image and video understanding/generation tasks, significantly improving the performance in each domain. 1. Introduction Recent advancements in human preference alignment have substantially propelled the progress of multimodal generation and understanding tasks. straightforward technique road is directly collecting human feedback to construct preference datasets for model optimization [29, 38, 52]. Despite its effectiveness, collecting large-scale human feedback is Figure 1. Overview of our UnifiedReward for Multimodal Understanding and Generation Alignment, including three steps: (1) Unified Reward Model Training, (2) Preference Data Construction, and (3) Generation/Understanding Model Alignment. time-consuming and resource-intensive. To this end, an alternative popular approach involves learning reward models [18, 24, 28, 40, 44, 47, 50] from limited amount of preference data and using the learned reward function to generate preference data based on the output of vision models. This synthetic preference data can then be leveraged for vision model preference alignment, significantly reducing the need for extensive human annotations. Despite their progress, we posit two concerns: (1) current reward models are often tailored to specific tasks, as shown in Tab. 1, limiting their adaptability across diverse visual understanding and generative tasks. The key challenge lies in the lack of comprehensive human preference dataset that spans wide range of visual tasks. (2) We intuitively argue that visual tasks are inherently interconnected, and jointly learning multiple visual tasks may create mutually reinforcing effect. Specifically, enhanced image understanding may improve the evaluation of image generation by providing more accurate assessment of content quality and contextual relevance. Similarly, improvements in image evaluation may benefit video evaluation, as high-quality image assessments lead to more accurate eval1 uations of video frames, contributing to overall better quality video assessment. This cross-task synergy facilitates more robust evaluation of outputs across both image and video modalities in tasks involving understanding and generation. It inspires the development of unified modal reward model that yields more precise reward signals for preference optimization. To this end, we propose UNIFIEDREWARD, the first unified reward model for multimodal understanding and generation model assessment, capable of both pairwise ranking and pointwise scoring, which can be utilized for preference alignment on diverse vision tasks. Our fine-tuning pipeline, as shown in Fig. 1, includes three key stages: (1) First, we construct large-scale human preference dataset that spans both image and video generation/understanding tasks and develop UNIFIEDREWARD based on this dataset. (2) Next, we employ UNIFIEDREWARD to automatically construct high-quality preference pair data by selecting the outputs of specific baselines, such as Vision Language Models (VLM) and diffusion models, through multi-stage filtering, i.e., pair ranking and point sifting. (3) Finally, we use these preference pairs to align the outputs of these models with human preferences via direct preference optimization. Our experiments show that learning multiple visual tasks together yields significant reciprocal benefits, enhancing performance in each individual domain. By implementing our pipeline across both image and video understanding and generation baselines, we observe notable improvements in their quality and alignment. In summary, our contributions are as follows: (1) We construct large-scale human preference dataset spans diverse vision tasks and develop UNIFIEDREWARD, the first unified reward model for multimodal understanding and generation model assessment, capable of both pairwise ranking and pointwise scoring. (2) We propose general pipeline for both image and video understanding/generation model preference alignment, which remains an underexplored area in current research. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the performance of vision models in each domain. (3) Our experiments show that learning to assess image and video tasks jointly leads to synergistic improvement in performance across different visual domains. Through this work, we aim to expand the scope of reward models, making them more adaptable, generalizable, and effective across various visual applications. 2. Related Work Reward Models are crucial in aligning vision understanding and generation models with human preferences. Traditional methods [13, 14, 30] for evaluating vision quality and semantic consistency rely on metrics such as FID [11] and CLIP scores [33]. Despite their effectiveness, they are limited to capturing human preferences. Therefore, recent Table 1. Comparison of Our Reward Method with Recent Approaches.

Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, but often at the cost of excessive verbosity in their intermediate outputs, which increases computational overhead. We introduce Sketch-of-Thought (SoT), a novel prompting framework that combines cognitive-inspired reasoning paradigms with linguistic constraints to minimize token usage while preserving reasoning accuracy. SoT is designed as a flexible framework that can incorporate any custom reasoning paradigms based on cognitive science, and we instantiate it with three such paradigms - Conceptual Chaining, Chunked Symbolism, and Expert Lexicons - each tailored to different reasoning tasks and selected dynamically via a lightweight routing model. Through comprehensive evaluation across 15 reasoning datasets with multiple languages and multimodal scenarios, we demonstrate that SoT achieves token reductions of 76% with negligible accuracy impact. In certain domains like mathematical and multi-hop reasoning, it even improves accuracy while using significantly fewer tokens. Our code is publicly available: https://www.github.com/SimonAytes/SoT.

Through comprehensive evaluation across 15 reasoning datasets with multiple languages and multimodal scenarios, we demonstrate that SoT achieves token reductions of 76% with negligible accuracy impact. In certain domains like mathematical and multi-hop reasoning, it even improves accuracy while using significantly fewer tokens. Our code is publicly available: https://www.github.com/SimonAytes/SoT."

An essential component of modern recurrent sequence models is the forget gate. While Transformers do not have an explicit recurrent form, we show that a forget gate can be naturally incorporated into Transformers by down-weighting the unnormalized attention scores in a data-dependent way. We name this attention mechanism the Forgetting Attention and the resulting model the Forgetting Transformer (FoX). We show that FoX outperforms the Transformer on long-context language modeling, length extrapolation, and short-context downstream tasks, while performing on par with the Transformer on long-context downstream tasks. Moreover, it is compatible with the FlashAttention algorithm and does not require any positional embeddings. Several analyses, including the needle-in-the-haystack test, show that FoX also retains the Transformer's superior long-context capabilities over recurrent sequence models such as Mamba-2, HGRN2, and DeltaNet. We also introduce a "Pro" block design that incorporates some common architectural components in recurrent sequence models and find it significantly improves the performance of both FoX and the Transformer. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhixuan-lin/forgetting-transformer.
