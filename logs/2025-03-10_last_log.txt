Text:"BEHAVIOR ROBOT SUITE: Streamlining Real-World Whole-Body Manipulation for Everyday Household Activities Yunfan Jiang, Ruohan Zhang, Josiah Wong, Chen Wang, Yanjie Ze, Hang Yin, Cem Gokmen, Shuran Song, Jiajun Wu, Li Fei-Fei Stanford University behavior-robot-suite.github.io 5 2 0 2 7 ] . [ 1 2 5 6 5 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r Fig. 1: Everyday household activities enabled by BEHAVIOR ROBOT SUITE (BRS), showcasing its three core capabilities: bimanual coordination (B), stable and accurate navigation (N), and extensive end-effector reachability (R). Each row illustrates the rollout trajectory of trained WB-VIMA policies, an imitation learning algorithm we developed, using data collected with JoyLo, our novel whole-body teleoperation interface. While every activity involves multiple capabilities, the most crucial capability for accomplishing each task is highlighted using B, N, and R. Activities from top to bottom are as follows. 1) Clean house after wild party (N): The robot navigates to dishwasher and opens it, then moves to gaming table to collect bowls. It returns to the dishwasher, places the bowls inside, and closes it. 2) Clean the toilet (R): The robot picks up sponge, opens the toilet cover, cleans the seat, then closes the cover and wipes it. Finally, it moves to press the flush button. 3) Take trash outside (N): The robot navigates to trash bag in the living room, picks it up, and carries it to closed door. It opens the door, moves outside, and deposits the trash bag into trash bin. 4) Put items onto shelves (R): The robot lifts box from the ground, moves to shelf, and places the box on the appropriate level based on available space. 5) Lay clothes out (B): The robot moves to wardrobe, opens it, picks up jacket on hanger, lays the jacket on sofa bed, then returns to the wardrobe and closes it.

Real-world household tasks present significant challenges for mobile manipulation robots. An analysis of existing robotics benchmarks reveals that successful task performance hinges on three key whole-body control capabilities: bimanual coordination, stable and precise navigation, and extensive end-effector reachability. Achieving these capabilities requires careful hardware design, but the resulting system complexity further complicates visuomotor policy learning. To address these challenges, we introduce the BEHAVIOR Robot Suite (BRS), a comprehensive framework for whole-body manipulation in diverse household tasks. Built on a bimanual, wheeled robot with a 4-DoF torso, BRS integrates a cost-effective whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection and a novel algorithm for learning whole-body visuomotor policies. We evaluate BRS on five challenging household tasks that not only emphasize the three core capabilities but also introduce additional complexities, such as long-range navigation, interaction with articulated and deformable objects, and manipulation in confined spaces. We believe that BRS's integrated robotic embodiment, data collection interface, and learning framework mark a significant step toward enabling real-world whole-body manipulation for everyday household tasks.
