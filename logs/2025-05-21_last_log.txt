LLM pruning has emerged as a promising technology for compressing LLMs, enabling their deployment on resource-limited devices. However, current methodologies typically require access to public calibration samples, which can be challenging to obtain in privacy-sensitive domains. To address this issue, we introduce FedPrLLM, a comprehensive federated pruning framework designed for the privacy-preserving compression of LLMs. In FedPrLLM, each client only needs to calculate a pruning mask matrix based on its local calibration data and share it with the server to prune the global model. This approach allows for collaborative pruning of the global model with the knowledge of each client while maintaining local data privacy. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore various possibilities within the FedPrLLM framework, including different comparison groups, pruning strategies, and the decision to scale weights. Our extensive evaluation reveals that one-shot pruning with layer comparison and no weight scaling is the optimal choice within the FedPrLLM framework. We hope our work will help guide future efforts in pruning LLMs in privacy-sensitive fields. Our code is available at https://github.com/Pengxin-Guo/FedPrLLM.

Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown substantially improved reasoning capabilities over traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating extended thinking processes prior to producing final responses. However, excessively lengthy thinking introduces substantial overhead in terms of token consumption and latency, which is particularly unnecessary for simple queries. In this work, we introduce Large Hybrid-Reasoning Models (LHRMs), the first kind of model capable of adaptively determining whether to perform thinking based on the contextual information of user queries. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training pipeline comprising Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) as a cold start, followed by online reinforcement learning with the proposed Hybrid Group Policy Optimization (HGPO) to implicitly learn to select the appropriate thinking mode. Furthermore, we introduce a metric called Hybrid Accuracy to quantitatively assess the model's capability for hybrid thinking. Extensive experimental results show that LHRMs can adaptively perform hybrid thinking on queries of varying difficulty and type. It outperforms existing LRMs and LLMs in reasoning and general capabilities while significantly improving efficiency. Together, our work advocates for a reconsideration of the appropriate use of extended thinking processes and provides a solid starting point for building hybrid thinking systems.

With the rapid advancement of powerful large language models (LLMs) in recent years, a wide range of software engineering tasks can now be addressed using LLMs, significantly enhancing productivity and scalability. Numerous benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these models, while they primarily focus on problem-solving and issue-resolution tasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MIGRATION-BENCH with a distinct focus: code migration. MIGRATION-BENCH aims to serve as a comprehensive benchmark for migration from Java 8 to the latest long-term support (LTS) versions (Java 17, 21), MIGRATION-BENCH includes a full dataset and its subset selected with 5,102 and 300 repositories respectively. Selected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty, offering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code migration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to facilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging task. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively tackle repository-level code migration to Java 17. For the selected subset with Claude-3.5-Sonnet-v2, SD-Feedback achieves 62.33% and 27.00% success rate (pass@1) for minimal and maximal migration respectively. The benchmark dataset and source code are available at: https://huggingface.co/collections/AmazonScience and https://github.com/amazon-science/self_debug respectively.

"With the rapid advancement of powerful large language models (LLMs) in recent years, a wide range of software engineering tasks can now be addressed using LLMs, significantly enhancing productivity and scalability. Numerous benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these models, while they primarily focus on problem-solving and issue-resolution tasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MIGRATION-BENCH with a distinct focus: code migration. MIGRATION-BENCH aims to serve as a comprehensive benchmark for migration from Java 8 to the latest long-term support (LTS) versions (Java 17, 21), MIGRATION-BENCH includes a full dataset and its subset selected with 5,102 and 300 repositories respectively. Selected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty, offering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code migration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to facilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging task. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively tackle repository-level code migration to Java 17.

Designing effective reasoning-capable LLMs typically requires training using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) or distillation with carefully curated Long Chain of Thoughts (CoT), both of which depend heavily on extensive training data. This creates a major challenge when the amount of quality training data is scarce. We propose a sample-efficient, two-stage training strategy to develop reasoning LLMs under limited supervision. In the first stage, we "warm up" the model by distilling Long CoTs from a toy domain, namely, Knights \& Knaves (K\&K) logic puzzles to acquire general reasoning skills. In the second stage, we apply RLVR to the warmed-up model using a limited set of target-domain examples. Our experiments demonstrate that this two-phase approach offers several benefits: (i) the warmup phase alone facilitates generalized reasoning, leading to performance improvements across a range of tasks, including MATH, HumanEval^{+}, and MMLU-Pro. (ii) When both the base model and the warmed-up model are RLVR trained on the same small dataset (leq100 examples), the warmed-up model consistently outperforms the base model; (iii) Warming up before RLVR training allows a model to maintain cross-domain generalizability even after training on a specific domain; (iv) Introducing warmup in the pipeline improves not only accuracy but also overall sample efficiency during RLVR training. The results in this paper highlight the promise of warmup for building robust reasoning LLMs in data-scarce environments.
