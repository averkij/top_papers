These results show that not all layers contribute equally during inference, and that selectively skipping most of them can improve the performance of models on certain tasks.In recent years, there have been remarkable advances in transformer-based language models (Vaswani, 2017), broadening their capabilities from natural language processing tasks to complex reasoning problems (OpenAI et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). However, despite these achievements, these models remain largely black boxes. Several approaches have been developed to make LMs more transparent, including circuit analysis (Elhage et al., 2021; Geva et al., 2020), activation analysis (Gurnee et al., 2023; Burns et al., 2022), probing (Alain and Bengio, 2018; Orgad et al., 2024), and mechanistic interpretability (Wang et al., 2022; Elhage et al., 2022; Bricken et al., 2023). In addition to the methods mentioned above, analyzing layer activation patterns in Language Models (LMs) offers valuable insights into how these models process inputs of varying complexity. We can pinpoint which layers get activated during the inference by employing Adaptive Computation techniques. These methods were originally designed to improve the efficiency (Dehghani et al., 2022) of neural networks (Bengio et al., 2016), recurrent neural networks (Graves, 2017; Banino et al., 2021), language models (Dehghani et al., 2019; Schuster et al., 2022; yikun jiang et al., 2024), and vision models (Bolukbasi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Xue et al., 2023). However, these techniques are not straightforward to use when analyzing layer activation patterns in LMs, since they need to be trained specifically for this purpose and often lead to degraded model performance. To address these limitations, we utilize L2 Adaptive Computation (LAC) (Shemiranifar and Dehghani, 2023), which offers simple approach compared to existing methods. LAC operates without requiring any training, making it particularly well-suited for analyzing LMs. This method functions by monitoring changes in the L2norm of layer activations to identify halting points. LAC provides three distinct halting stages: per-batch, perexample, and per-token. We focus on the per-token setting since we aim to observe which layers are activated while LMs process and generate tokens 1The code is available in https://github.com/manishemirani/void_in_language_models Our analysis examines layer activation patterns across two distinct phases: Prompt Processing (PP): We use LACs per-token setting to track activated layers as the model processes each token within the input prompts. Response Generation (RG): We use LACs per-token setting to track activated layers as the model generates each token based on the given input prompt. We evaluate our method on three distinct instruction-tuned Language Models from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families, across range of challenging benchmarks: MMLU, GPQA Diamond, and BoolQ. Our findings reveal that Language Models do not consistently activate all layers during inference. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that selectively skipping these detected Voids can lead to performance improvements on certain tasks, even when utilizing significantly reduced subset of the models total layers. For instance, on MMLU with zero-shot setting, skipping Voids in Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct resulted in an improvement from 69.24 to 71.29 accuracy while using only 30% of the models layers. Similarly, Mistral-7B-Instructv0.3 on GPQA Diamond saw an improvement from 13.88 to 18.36 accuracy when using approximately 70% of its layers across both PP and RG phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that distinct layers are activated during the Prompt Processing and Response Generation phases, highlighting task-dependent computational allocation within these models. The consistent presence of Voids across different models and tasks, coupled with the observed performance gains when selectively skipping them, strongly indicates that layers contribute unequally during inference. Our method, which precisely identifies these Voids, thus provides valuable insights into the inner workings of Language Models. This approach opens new avenues for interpretability, targeted knowledge editing, and hallucination detection by pinpointing layers that are less crucial for specific computations.In this section, we will review the core concept of L2 adaptive computation, detailing how measurements of the L2-norm (Section 2.1) can be applied at various levels of granularity. Next, we examine LACs halting mechanism (Section 2.2), which leverages these measurements to halt computations. We then analyze the threshold sensitivity (Section 2.3). Finally, we discuss the practical implementation of granular halting through masking (Section 2.4)."

Despite advances in transformer-based language models (LMs), a fundamental question remains largely unanswered: Are all layers activated during inference? We investigate this question by detecting unactivated layers (which we refer to as Voids) using a non-trainable and parameter-free adaptive computation method called L2 Adaptive Computation (LAC). We adapt LAC from its original efficiency-focused application to trace activated layers during inference. This method monitors changes in the L2-norm of activations to identify voids. We analyze layer activation in instruction-tuned LMs across two phases: Prompt Processing (PP), where we trace activated layers for each token in the input prompts, and Response Generation (RG), where we trace activated layers for each generated token. We further demonstrate that distinct layers are activated during these two phases. To show the effectiveness of our method, we evaluated three distinct instruction-tuned LMs from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families on three benchmarks: MMLU, GPQA Diamond, and BoolQ. For example, on MMLU with a zero-shot setting, skipping voids in Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct resulted in an improvement from 69.24 to 71.29 while the model uses only 30% of the layers. Similarly, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 on GPQA Diamond improved from 13.88 to 18.36 when using 70% of the layers during both the PP and RG phases. These results show that not all layers contribute equally during inference, and that selectively skipping most of them can improve the performance of models on certain tasks.
