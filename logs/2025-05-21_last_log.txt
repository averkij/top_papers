[ 1 4 6 4 4 1 . 5 0 5 2 : r Not All Correct Answers Are Equal: Why Your Distillation Source Matters Xiaoyu Tian, Yunjie Ji, Haotian Wang, Shuaiting Chen, Sitong Zhao, Yiping Peng, Han Zhao, Xiangang Li a-m-teamDistillation has emerged as practical and effective approach to enhance the reasoning capabilities of open-source language models. In this work, we conduct largescale empirical study on reasoning data distillation by collecting verified outputs from three state-of-the-art teacher modelsAM-Thinking-v1, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-R1on shared corpus of 1.89 million queries. We construct three parallel datasets and analyze their distributions, revealing that AM-Thinking-v1distilled data exhibits greater token length diversity and lower perplexity. Student models trained on each dataset are evaluated on reasoning benchmarks including AIME2024, AIME2025, MATH500, and LiveCodeBench. The AM-based model consistently achieves the best performance (e.g., 84.3 on AIME2024, 72.2 on AIME2025, 98.4 on MATH500, and 65.9 on LiveCodeBench) and demonstrates adaptive output behaviorproducing longer responses for harder tasks and shorter ones for simpler tasks. These findings highlight the value of high-quality, verified reasoning traces. We release the AM-Thinking-v1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B distilled datasets to support future research on open and high-performing reasoning-oriented language models. The datasets are publicly available on Hugging Face2. Figure 1: Open-source model benchmarks on AIME2024/LiveCodeBench. 1The a-m-team is an internal team at Beike (Ke.com), dedicated to exploring AGI technology. 2Datasets are available on Hugging Face: AM-Thinking-v1-Distilled, AM-Qwen3-Distilled.Recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of distillation-based training for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) [1, 2, 3]. By transferring reasoning traces from stronger teacher models, distilled data enables smaller or open-source models to achieve significant improvements on challenging tasks such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. Building on this line of research, we systematically distilled reasoning data from three state-ofthe-art models: DeepSeek-R1 [1], Qwen3-235B-A22B [3], and AM-Thinking-v1 [4]. For each of approximately 1.89 million identical queries, we collected full chain-of-thought responses from all three models, resulting in three parallel large-scale datasets. This unique setup allows for direct comparison of reasoning styles and data distributions across leading models. We carefully processed and cleaned all three datasets, including thorough deduplication, strict filtering, and contamination removal. We further analyzed the data distributions and content diversity to provide comprehensive understanding of the strengths and characteristics of each distillation source. Our experiments show that models trained with data distilled from AM-Thinking-v1 achieve particularly strong performance. On challenging reasoning benchmarks, such as AIME2024 [5] (84.3), AIME2025 [6] (72.2), MATH500 [7] (98.4), and LiveCodeBench [8] (65.9), the AM-Thinking-v1 distilled model consistently outperforms those trained on Qwen3-235B-A22B or DeepSeek-R1 data. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the AM-Thinking-v1 distilled model exhibits an adaptive generation length: producing longer responses on harder tasks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench), and shorter ones on simpler datasets (e.g., MATH500). This behavior aligns with the token-level distribution of the AM-distilled dataset, which contains both short and long responses more frequently than the other two sources. These results highlight the practical value of large-scale, high-quality reasoning data distillation, for improving open-source LLMs. To promote further progress in the field, we release both the AM-Thinking-v1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B distilled datasets3. We hope our work provides valuable resources and insights for the open-source community, enabling more effective reasoning-focused model development and contributing to the broader progress of reasoning research.This section first introduces the data preprocessing and distillation pipeline used to construct our training corpus, and then presents detailed analysis of the resulting datasets in terms of distribution, length, and quality. 2.1 Data Collection and Query Processing To support robust and comprehensive model training, we constructed large-scale training corpus by aggregating data from diverse set of publicly available open-source corpora. These corpora span broad range of NLP tasks, including mathematical reasoning, code generation, scientific reasoning, instruction following, multi-turn dialogue, and general reasoning. For downstream analysis and targeted data processing, each data source was systematically assigned to specific task category. Training Data Categories The aggregated training data were classified as follows: Mathematical Reasoning: Datasets requiring advanced numerical reasoning and multistep logic, such as OpenR1-Math-220k [9], Big-Math-RL-Verified [10], NuminaMath [11], among others. Code Generation: Datasets aimed at enhancing code synthesis and programmatic problemsolving abilities, including PRIME [12], DeepCoder [13], KodCode [14]. Scientific Reasoning: Datasets emphasizing reasoning within the natural sciences, such as task_mmmlu [15], chemistryQA [16], and LOGIC-701 [17]. 3Note that since the distillation data of DeepSeek-R1 is easily accessible, we only release the distillation data of AM-Thinking-v1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Instruction Following (IF): Data focused on instruction comprehension and faithful execution, including Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset [18], tulu-3-sft-mixture [19], if-eval-like, and AutoIF. Multi-turn Conversation: Corpora curated to train dialogue agents on contextually coherent and consistent multi-turn interactions, such as InfinityInstruct [20], OpenHermes-2.5 [21], and ultra_chat [22]. General Reasoning: Datasets covering diverse open-ended reasoning and general knowledge tasks, including evol [23], open_orca [24], flan [25]. Query Preprocessing To guarantee the reliability of subsequent model training, we applied rigorous multi-stage preprocessing to the raw queries: 1. Deduplication: Exact duplicate queries (identical text) were removed. 2. Filtering: Queries with high Unicode character ratio were discarded to eliminate corrupted or meaningless samples.

[ 1 5 3 1 4 1 . 5 0 5 2 : r Hunyuan-Game Tencent HunyuanIntelligent game creation represents transformative advancement in game development, utilizing generative artificial intelligence to dynamically generate and enhance game content. Despite notable progress in generative models, the comprehensive synthesis of high-quality game assets, including both images and videos, remains challenging frontier. To create high-fidelity game content that simultaneously aligns with player preferences and significantly boosts designer efficiency, we present Hunyuan-Game, an innovative project designed to revolutionize intelligent game production. Hunyuan-Game encompasses two primary branches: image generation and video generation. The image generation component is built upon vast dataset comprising billions of game images, leading to the development of group of customized image generation models tailored for game scenarios: (1) General Text-to-Image Generation. (2) Game Visual Effects Generation, involving text-to-effect and reference image-based game visual effect generation. (3) Transparent Image Generation for characters, scenes, and game visual effects. (4) Game Character Generation based on sketches, black-and-white images, and white models. The video generation component is built upon comprehensive dataset of millions of game and anime videos, leading to the development of five core algorithmic models, each targeting critical pain points in game development and having robust adaptation to diverse game video scenarios: (1) Image-to-Video Generation. (2) 360 A/T Pose Character Video Generation. (3) Dynamic Illustration Generation. (4) Generative Video Super-Resolution. (5) Interactive Game Video Generation. These image and video generation models not only exhibit high-level aesthetic expression but also deeply integrate domain-specific knowledge, establishing systematic understanding of diverse game and anime art styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate our models state-of-the-art performance, particularly in visual fidelity and motion naturalness, surpassing competitors like Midjourney, Kling and Wan in game scenarios. We aim to encourage community-driven innovation, foster collaborative development, and pave the way for broader applications in the gaming industry.Intelligent game creation represents transformative advancement in the field of game development, leveraging generative artificial intelligence to automate and enhance various aspects of game creation. This technology enables the dynamic generation of game content, such as scenes, characters, and game visual effects, which can adapt to player preferences and behaviors. From the perspective of game designers, intelligent game generation offers powerful toolset that significantly reduces the time and resources required for content creation. It allows designers to focus more on creative and strategic elements, as AI handles repetitive and labor-intensive tasks. This not only accelerates the development process but also fosters innovation by enabling the exploration of complex game mechanics and narratives that were previously impractical due to resource constraints. corresponding author (Email: qinglinlu@tencent.com) Figure 1: Hunyuan-Game-Image. The image generation capabilities of Hunyuan-Game include textto-image generation, text-to-game effects generation, reference-based game visual effects generation, transparent and seamless image generation, and game character/scene generation. These capabilities offer powerful toolset that significantly reduces the time and resources required for content creation, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of game asset production. 2 Figure 2: Hunyuan-Game-Video. The five key video generation capabilities of Hunyuan-Game are demonstrated as follows: an Image-to-Video generation and 360-degree A/T Pose Avatar Video Synthesis (I2V); Dynamic Illustration Generation based on first and last frame generation (FLF2V); video super-resolution from original video content (V2V); and Interactive Game Video Generation based on text or image input. The rapid advancement of generative models has revolutionized various domains, from entertainment to education. However, the synthesis of high-quality game assets, including both images and videos, remains relatively untapped area, despite the growing demand for realistic and immersive gaming experiences. Game assets are not only form of entertainment but also crucial component in game development, marketing, and community engagement. The ability to generate professional-grade game assets can significantly enhance the storytelling and visual appeal of games, offering players more engaging and dynamic experience. Additionally, it can improve designer efficiency, streamlining the creative process and allowing for faster iteration and innovation. The creation of professional game assets involves several complex tasks, such as generating highresolution content, transforming static images into dynamic sequences, and ensuring temporal consistency in animations. Traditional methods often require extensive manual effort and specialized skills, which can be both time-consuming and costly. The integration of advanced generation techniques into game development promises to address these challenges by automating content creation, thus enabling developers to focus on more creative aspects of game design. However, despite the progress in generative models, there remains notable gap in the availability of comprehensive, open-source tools specifically tailored for game asset synthesis. In game asset generation, there are multiple challenges and difficulties that require advanced technology and innovative solutions to overcome: Large-scale Data for Game-specific Scenarios: The generation of high-quality game assets requires extensive datasets specific to game scenarios, which are often lacking. Alignment with Vertical Game Scenarios: General models often lack the ability to align with the specific needs of the game industry, lacking deep understanding and precise handling of the unique requirements involved in game development.

The efficiency of attention is important due to its quadratic time complexity. We enhance the efficiency of attention through two key contributions: First, we leverage the new FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell GPUs to accelerate attention computation. Our implementation achieves 1038 TOPS on RTX5090, which is a 5x speedup over the fastest FlashAttention on RTX5090. Experiments show that our FP4 attention can accelerate inference of various models in a plug-and-play way. Second, we pioneer low-bit attention to training tasks. Existing low-bit attention works like FlashAttention3 and SageAttention focus only on inference. However, the efficiency of training large models is also important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied to training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both forward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention achieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower convergence in pretraining tasks. The code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero, enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include: (1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics, chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these 12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC) demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for long video understanding (LVU), prompting the development of standardized LVU benchmarks to evaluate their performance. However, our investigation reveals a rather sober lesson for existing LVU benchmarks. First, most existing benchmarks rely heavily on multiple-choice questions (MCQs), whose evaluation results are inflated due to the possibility of guessing the correct answer; Second, a significant portion of questions in these benchmarks have strong priors to allow models to answer directly without even reading the input video. For example, Gemini-1.5-Pro can achieve over 50\% accuracy given a random frame from a long video on Video-MME. We also observe that increasing the number of frames does not necessarily lead to improvement on existing benchmarks, which is counterintuitive. As a result, the validity and robustness of current LVU benchmarks are undermined, impeding a faithful assessment of LMMs' long-video understanding capability. To tackle this problem, we propose VideoEval-Pro, a realistic LVU benchmark containing questions with open-ended short-answer, which truly require understanding the entire video. VideoEval-Pro assesses both segment-level and full-video understanding through perception and reasoning tasks. By evaluating 21 proprietary and open-source video LMMs, we conclude the following findings: (1) video LMMs show drastic performance (>25\%) drops on open-ended questions compared with MCQs; (2) surprisingly, higher MCQ scores do not lead to higher open-ended scores on VideoEval-Pro; (3) compared to other MCQ benchmarks, VideoEval-Pro benefits more from increasing the number of input frames. Our results show that VideoEval-Pro offers a more realistic and reliable measure of long video understanding, providing a clearer view of progress in this domain.

Distillation has emerged as a practical and effective approach to enhance the reasoning capabilities of open-source language models. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on reasoning data distillation by collecting verified outputs from three state-of-the-art teacher models-AM-Thinking-v1, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-R1-on a shared corpus of 1.89 million queries. We construct three parallel datasets and analyze their distributions, revealing that AM-Thinking-v1-distilled data exhibits greater token length diversity and lower perplexity. Student models trained on each dataset are evaluated on reasoning benchmarks including AIME2024, AIME2025, MATH500, and LiveCodeBench. The AM-based model consistently achieves the best performance (e.g., 84.3 on AIME2024, 72.2 on AIME2025, 98.4 on MATH500, and 65.9 on LiveCodeBench) and demonstrates adaptive output behavior-producing longer responses for harder tasks and shorter ones for simpler tasks. These findings highlight the value of high-quality, verified reasoning traces. We release the AM-Thinking-v1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B distilled datasets to support future research on open and high-performing reasoning-oriented language models. The datasets are publicly available on Hugging FaceDatasets are available on Hugging Face: \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/a-m-team/AM-Thinking-v1-Distilled{AM-Thinking-v1-Distilled}, https://huggingface.co/datasets/a-m-team/AM-Qwen3-Distilled{AM-Qwen3-Distilled}.}.

Despite impressive advancements in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal tasks, their reliance on RGB inputs limits precise spatial understanding. Existing methods for integrating spatial cues, such as point clouds or depth, either require specialized sensors or fail to effectively exploit depth information for higher-order reasoning. To this end, we propose a novel Spatial Sense and Reasoning method, dubbed SSR, a novel framework that transforms raw depth data into structured, interpretable textual rationales. These textual rationales serve as meaningful intermediate representations to significantly enhance spatial reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we leverage knowledge distillation to compress the generated rationales into compact latent embeddings, which facilitate resource-efficient and plug-and-play integration into existing VLMs without retraining. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new dataset named SSR-CoT, a million-scale visual-language reasoning dataset enriched with intermediate spatial reasoning annotations, and present SSRBench, a comprehensive multi-task benchmark. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate SSR substantially improves depth utilization and enhances spatial reasoning, thereby advancing VLMs toward more human-like multi-modal understanding. Our project page is at https://yliu-cs.github.io/SSR.

"Despite impressive advancements in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal tasks, their reliance on RGB inputs limits precise spatial understanding. Existing methods for integrating spatial cues, such as point clouds or depth, either require specialized sensors or fail to effectively exploit depth information for higher-order reasoning. To this end, we propose a novel Spatial Sense and Reasoning method, dubbed SSR, a novel framework that transforms raw depth data into structured, interpretable textual rationales. These textual rationales serve as meaningful intermediate representations to significantly enhance spatial reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we leverage knowledge distillation to compress the generated rationales into compact latent embeddings, which facilitate resource-efficient and plug-and-play integration into existing VLMs without retraining. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new dataset named SSR-CoT, a million-scale visual-language reasoning dataset enriched with intermediate spatial reasoning annotations, and present SSRBench, a comprehensive multi-task benchmark. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate SSR substantially improves depth utilization and enhances spatial reasoning, thereby advancing VLMs toward more human-like multi-modal understanding.

Intelligent game creation represents a transformative advancement in game development, utilizing generative artificial intelligence to dynamically generate and enhance game content. Despite notable progress in generative models, the comprehensive synthesis of high-quality game assets, including both images and videos, remains a challenging frontier. To create high-fidelity game content that simultaneously aligns with player preferences and significantly boosts designer efficiency, we present Hunyuan-Game, an innovative project designed to revolutionize intelligent game production. Hunyuan-Game encompasses two primary branches: image generation and video generation. The image generation component is built upon a vast dataset comprising billions of game images, leading to the development of a group of customized image generation models tailored for game scenarios: (1) General Text-to-Image Generation. (2) Game Visual Effects Generation, involving text-to-effect and reference image-based game visual effect generation. (3) Transparent Image Generation for characters, scenes, and game visual effects. (4) Game Character Generation based on sketches, black-and-white images, and white models. The video generation component is built upon a comprehensive dataset of millions of game and anime videos, leading to the development of five core algorithmic models, each targeting critical pain points in game development and having robust adaptation to diverse game video scenarios: (1) Image-to-Video Generation. (2) 360 A/T Pose Avatar Video Synthesis. (3) Dynamic Illustration Generation. (4) Generative Video Super-Resolution. (5) Interactive Game Video Generation. These image and video generation models not only exhibit high-level aesthetic expression but also deeply integrate domain-specific knowledge, establishing a systematic understanding of diverse game and anime art styles.

Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning for complex tasks inherently involves a trade-off between solution accuracy and computational efficiency. The subsequent step of verification, while intended to improve performance, further complicates this landscape by introducing its own challenging trade-off: sophisticated Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) can be computationally prohibitive if naively integrated with LLMs at test-time, while simpler, faster methods may lack reliability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce FlexiVe, a novel generative verifier that flexibly balances computational resources between rapid, reliable fast thinking and meticulous slow thinking using a Flexible Allocation of Verification Budget strategy. We further propose the Solve-Detect-Verify pipeline, an efficient inference-time scaling framework that intelligently integrates FlexiVe, proactively identifying solution completion points to trigger targeted verification and provide focused solver feedback. Experiments show FlexiVe achieves superior accuracy in pinpointing errors within reasoning traces on ProcessBench. Furthermore, on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and CNMO), our full approach outperforms baselines like self-consistency in reasoning accuracy and inference efficiency.
