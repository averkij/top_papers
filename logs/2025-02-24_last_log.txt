Despite how useful these systems might be, unchecked AI agency poses signiﬁcant risks to public safety and security, ranging from misuse by malicious actors to potentially irreversible loss of human control. We discuss how these risks arise from current AI training methods. Indeed, various scenarios and experiments have demonstrated the possibility of AI agents engaging in deception or pursuing goals that were not speciﬁed by human operators and that conﬂict with human interests, such as self-preservation. Following the precautionary principle, we see strong need for safer, yet still useful, alternatives to the current agency-driven trajectory. Accordingly, we propose as core building block for further advances the development of non-agentic AI system that is trustworthy and safe by design, which we call Scientist AI. This system is designed to explain the world from observations, as opposed to taking actions in it to imitate or please humans. It comprises world model that generates theories to explain data and question-answering inference machine. Both components operate with an explicit notion of uncertainty to mitigate the risks of overIn light of these considerations, Scientist AI could be used to assist human conﬁdent predictions. researchers in accelerating scientiﬁc progress, including in AI safety.

Text:"UPCORE: Utility-Preserving Coreset Selection for Balanced Unlearning Vaidehi Patil 1 Elias Stengel-Eskin 1 Mohit BansalUser specifications or legal frameworks often require information to be removed from pretrained models, including large language models (LLMs). This requires deleting or forgetting set of data points from an already-trained model, which typically degrades its performance on other data points. Thus, balance must be struck between removing information and keeping the models other abilities intact, with failure to balance this trade-off leading to poor deletion or an unusable model. To this end, we propose UPCORE (Utility-Preserving Coreset Selection), methodagnostic data selection framework for mitigating collateral damage during unlearning. Finding that the model damage is correlated with the variance of the models representations on the forget set, we selectively prune the forget set to remove outliers, thereby minimizing model degradation after unlearning. We evaluate UPCORE across three standard unlearning methods consistently achieving superior balance between the competing objectives of deletion efficacy and model preservation. To better evaluate this trade-off, we introduce new metric, measuring the areaunder-the-curve (AUC) across standard metrics. We find that UPCORE improves both standard metrics and AUC, benefitting from positive transfer between the coreset and pruned points while reducing negative transfer from the forget set to points outside of it.1 5 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 2 8 0 5 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r 1. Introduction The widespread deployment of ML models, particularly large language models (LLMs), has raised significant concerns regarding data privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethical AI practices. These models are often trained on vast amounts of uncurated data scraped from the internet, inher1UNC Chapel Hill. Correspondence to: Vaidehi Patil <vaidehi@cs.unc.edu>. 1Our code and data is available at: https://github.com/ Vaidehi99/UPCORE 1 Figure 1. Left: Standard unlearning methods are applied equally to all points in the forget set. Here, outlier points in the models hidden space (visualized in 2D) contribute to the unintentional forgetting of points outside of the forget set (i.e. collateral damage). Right: By finding lower-variance coreset within the forget set, UPCORE reduces damage while maintaining forget performance via positive transfer from the coreset to the pruned points. ently capturing sensitive, copyrighted, or undesirable content (Shokri et al., 2017; Carlini et al., 2019). As regulations like the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) empower individuals with the right to be forgotten, the need for efficient techniques that remove specific data or topics from trained models has become increasingly critical. Machine unlearning has emerged as promising solution, enabling the targeted removal of data, concepts, or facts without the computational expense of retraining from scratch. Moreover, machine unlearning has benefits beyond compliance, addressing broader challenges such as mitigating harmful outputs, preserving intellectual property rights, and aligning LLMs with ethical and societal expectations (Jang et al., 2023). These practical uses have spurred growing interest in understanding, rethinking, and improving model editing and unlearning methodologies (Liu et al., 2024; Hase et al., 2024). Given the growing adoption of LLMs, past work has proposed methods for developing and evaluating techniques for removing knowledge or skills from LLMs (Cao & Yang, 2015; Bourtoule et al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2022) and steering their behavior in targeted ways (Sinitsin et al., 2020; UPCORE: Utility-Preserving Coreset Selection for Balanced Unlearning Meng et al., 2022). However, these editing methods often involve modifying the model in ways that lead to unintended consequences, such as reduced model utility on tasks or knowledge unrelated to the target. Thus, balance must be struck between the successful unlearning of undesired information and maintaining the utility of the model by minimizing collateral damage. For this reason, current approaches generally evaluate unlearning or model editing methods based on their efficacy in altering intended knowledge measured by how successfully forget set is removed and based on their collateral effects on unrelated behaviors, i.e. the accuracy on retain set. This kind of evaluation is especially crucial in realistic settings where unlearning happens on topic. Such topic-based unlearning commonly arises in practical scenarios, for example, when deleting all information associated with an individual or with sensitive domains (Li et al., 2024). Here, the likelihood of over-generalization to similar topics beyond the domain being deleted is high. key gap in existing research lies in understanding the specific data characteristics that drive overgeneralization and collateral effects during unlearning. While prior work (Sheshadri et al., 2024; Chowdhury et al., 2024) has measured damage resulting from unlearning, it does not investigate how attributes of the data such as its variance contribute to collateral damage or whether these attributes can be controlled to optimize the trade-off between deletion efficacy and utility retention. Focusing on topic-based setting where the forget set comprises semantically coherent groups of information, we seek to address these questions: 1. What measurable attributes of the forget set drive collateral effects during the unlearning process? 2. Can these attributes be systematically controlled to optimize the trade-off between deletion effectiveness and model utility? We investigate which properties of the forget data correlate with collateral damage during unlearning. Our analysis reveals strong positive correlation between the variance of the models hidden states corresponding to datapoints in the forget set (hidden state variance, or HSV), and the extent of collateral damage to the model after unlearning. In other words, unlearning set of widely-distributed datapoints (as shown in Figure 1 (left)) leads to more damage than unlearning more densely-distributed set. Building on this insight, we hypothesize that selectively curating coreset with lower variance from the larger forget set can help optimize this trade-off, as shown in Figure 1 (right). To this end, we introduce UPCORE, which constructs core forget set "

Multi-turn instruction following capability constitutes a core competency of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on fine-grained constraint satisfaction and domain-specific capability assessment, yet overlook the crucial structural dependency between dialogue turns that distinguishes multi-turn from single-turn interactions. This structural dependency not only reflects user intent but also establishes a second dimension for instruction following evaluation beyond constraint satisfaction. To address this gap, we propose StructFlowBench, a multi-turn instruction following benchmark with structural flow modeling. The benchmark innovatively defines a structural flow framework comprising six fundamental inter-turn relationships, which not only introduces novel structural constraints for model evaluation but also serves as generation parameters for creating customized dialogue flows tailored to specific scenarios. Adopting established LLM-based automatic evaluation methodologies, we conduct systematic evaluations of 13 leading open-source and closed-source LLMs. Experimental results reveal significant deficiencies in current models' comprehension of multi-turn dialogue structures. The code is available at https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/StructFlowBench.

"Multi-turn instruction following capability constitutes a core competency of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on fine-grained constraint satisfaction and domain-specific capability assessment, yet overlook the crucial structural dependency between dialogue turns that distinguishes multi-turn from single-turn interactions. This structural dependency not only reflects user intent but also establishes a second dimension for instruction following evaluation beyond constraint satisfaction. To address this gap, we propose StructFlowBench, a multi-turn instruction following benchmark with structural flow modeling. The benchmark innovatively defines a structural flow framework comprising six fundamental inter-turn relationships, which not only introduces novel structural constraints for model evaluation but also serves as generation parameters for creating customized dialogue flows tailored to specific scenarios. Adopting established LLM-based automatic evaluation methodologies, we conduct systematic evaluations of 13 leading open-source and closed-source LLMs. Experimental results reveal significant deficiencies in current models' comprehension of multi-turn dialogue structures. The code is available at https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/StructFlowBench."

The leading AI companies are increasingly focused on building generalist AI agents -- systems that can autonomously plan, act, and pursue goals across almost all tasks that humans can perform. Despite how useful these systems might be, unchecked AI agency poses significant risks to public safety and security, ranging from misuse by malicious actors to a potentially irreversible loss of human control. We discuss how these risks arise from current AI training methods. Indeed, various scenarios and experiments have demonstrated the possibility of AI agents engaging in deception or pursuing goals that were not specified by human operators and that conflict with human interests, such as self-preservation. Following the precautionary principle, we see a strong need for safer, yet still useful, alternatives to the current agency-driven trajectory. Accordingly, we propose as a core building block for further advances the development of a non-agentic AI system that is trustworthy and safe by design, which we call Scientist AI. This system is designed to explain the world from observations, as opposed to taking actions in it to imitate or please humans. It comprises a world model that generates theories to explain data and a question-answering inference machine. Both components operate with an explicit notion of uncertainty to mitigate the risks of overconfident predictions. In light of these considerations, a Scientist AI could be used to assist human researchers in accelerating scientific progress, including in AI safety. In particular, our system can be employed as a guardrail against AI agents that might be created despite the risks involved. Ultimately, focusing on non-agentic AI may enable the benefits of AI innovation while avoiding the risks associated with the current trajectory. We hope these arguments will motivate researchers, developers, and policymakers to favor this safer path.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is hindered by the substantial memory and computational costs associated with generating lengthy tokens. In this paper, we propose LightThinker, a novel method that enables LLMs to dynamically compress intermediate thoughts during reasoning. Inspired by human cognitive processes, LightThinker compresses verbose thought steps into compact representations and discards the original reasoning chains, thereby significantly reducing the number of tokens stored in the context window. This is achieved by training the model on when and how to perform compression through data construction, mapping hidden states to condensed gist tokens, and creating specialized attention masks. Additionally, we introduce the Dependency (Dep) metric to quantify the degree of compression by measuring the reliance on historical tokens during generation. Extensive experiments on four datasets and two models show that LightThinker reduces peak memory usage and inference time, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work provides a new direction for improving the efficiency of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks without sacrificing performance. Code will be released at https://github.com/zjunlp/LightThinker.

User specifications or legal frameworks often require information to be removed from pretrained models, including large language models (LLMs). This requires deleting or "forgetting" a set of data points from an already-trained model, which typically degrades its performance on other data points. Thus, a balance must be struck between removing information and keeping the model's other abilities intact, with a failure to balance this trade-off leading to poor deletion or an unusable model. To this end, we propose UPCORE (Utility-Preserving Coreset Selection), a method-agnostic data selection framework for mitigating collateral damage during unlearning. Finding that the model damage is correlated with the variance of the model's representations on the forget set, we selectively prune the forget set to remove outliers, thereby minimizing model degradation after unlearning. We evaluate UPCORE across three standard unlearning methods consistently achieving a superior balance between the competing objectives of deletion efficacy and model preservation. To better evaluate this trade-off, we introduce a new metric, measuring the area-under-the-curve (AUC) across standard metrics. We find that UPCORE improves both standard metrics and AUC, benefitting from positive transfer between the coreset and pruned points while reducing negative transfer from the forget set to points outside of it.
