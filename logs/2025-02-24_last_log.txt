Text:"Mol-LLaMA: Towards General Understanding of Molecules in Large Molecular Language Model Dongki Kim 1 Wonbin Lee 1 Sung Ju HwangUnderstanding molecules is key to understanding organisms and driving advances in drug discovery, requiring interdisciplinary knowledge across chemistry and biology. Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in interpreting molecular structures, their instruction datasets are limited to the specific knowledge from task-oriented datasets and do not fully cover the fundamental characteristics of molecules, hindering their abilities as general-purpose molecular assistants. To address this issue, we propose Mol-LLaMA, large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules via multi-modal instruction tuning. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental features of molecules, incorporating essential knowledge from molecular structures. In addition, to improve understanding of molecular features, we introduce module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of different molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that MolLLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and generating relevant responses to users queries with detailed explanations, implying its potential as general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis. 5 2 0 2 9 1 ] . [ 1 9 4 4 3 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r 1. Introduction Understanding molecules and their properties is fundamental to understanding chemical compounds and living organisms, driving scientific discovery. However, it remains challenging due to the complexity of molecules and their behaviors, necessitating comprehensive understanding 1Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Seoul, South Korea 2DeepAuto.ai. CorDongki Kim <cleverki@kaist.ac.kr>, respondence Wonbin Lee <smilelwb01@kaist.ac.kr>, Sung Ju Hwang <sungju.hwang@kaist.ac.kr>. to: Preliminary work. 1 of molecules. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) (Touvron et al., 2023; Grattafiori et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2024a;b) have demonstrated their potential in understanding core concepts in chemistry and biology (AI4Science & Quantum, 2023; Sadeghi et al., 2024). Further, LLMs have shown that language can play various roles, which is especially crucial to dealing with substantial complexity in chemistry, biology, and further pharmacology by readily obtaining external knowledge from users prompts. Nevertheless, LLMs can only process string representations such as SMILES (Weininger, 1988), struggling to understand the entire molecular structures. To integrate structural information into LLMs, recent works have developed molecular LLMs which are instructiontuned with the molecular modality, achieving notable success in task transfer. Specifically, recent works (Liu et al., 2023b; Cao et al., 2023; Fang et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Park et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024) adopt the multi-modal instruction tuning: 1) constructing moleculetext pairs from public databases or by utilizing GPTs to augment descriptions and 2) instruction-tuning LLMs with projectors in an end-to-end manner, as widely studied in multi-modal LLMs for image (Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024a), audio (Fathullah et al., 2024), and video (Chen et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Maaz et al., 2024). Despite their success, molecular LLMs still encounter difficulties in understanding the fundamental characteristics of molecules. Even though the molecular features span wide range including structural, chemical, and biological features, their understanding falls short as the scope of knowledge handled by the instruction datasets is narrow and typically task-specific, forgetting the general knowledge of molecules and losing their capabilities to handle the users requests. As result, recent molecular LLMs struggle to accurately reason molecular properties and provide detailed rationales in the zero-shot setting, hindering their ability to serve as versatile, general-purpose molecular assistants. To address this issue, we propose Mol-LLaMA, which learns fundamental knowledge centered on molecules, positioning it as general-purpose molecular assistant. To this end, we first establish an instruction dataset that encompasses the core levels for molecular understanding, proposMol-LLaMA: Towards General Understanding of Molecules in Large Molecular Language Model ing three data types including detailed structural descriptions, structure-to-feature relationship explanations, and comprehensive conversations. Our dataset is focused on not only the fundamental knowledge of molecules but also the reasoning ability as it is designed to explicitly provide causality by associating molecular features to the structures. Further, to improve the structural understanding, we introduce blending module that combines molecular information from both 2D and 3D encoders using the cross-attention mechanism. By integrating complementary information from different representations, the blending module facilitates alleviating the hallucination problem, improving to capture the structural information and thus enhancing the understanding of molecular features. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of MolLLaMA in explaining the general features of molecules at the structural, chemical, and biological levels. Our results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA outperforms baselines including LLMs and molecular LLMs, providing accurate, detailed, and helpful responses. We further evaluate MolLLaMA on the molecular property prediction task, where it not only accurately predicts molecular properties but also generates relevant and helpful explanations, highlighting its utility as general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose Mol-LLaMA that learns general knowledge for molecules across structural, chemical, and biological aspects, empowering to provide accurate and helpful responses with detailed explanations. We design three different data types for the general understanding of molecules, establishing large and informative instruction dataset centered on molecular features. We devise blending module to fully leverage the complementary information from different types of encoders, alleviating the hallucination and thus enhancing the understanding of molecular structures and a"

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional comprehension capabilities and a vast knowledge base, suggesting that LLMs can serve as efficient tools for automated survey generation. However, recent research related to automated survey generation remains constrained by some critical limitations like finite context window, lack of in-depth content discussion, and absence of systematic evaluation frameworks. Inspired by human writing processes, we propose SurveyX, an efficient and organized system for automated survey generation that decomposes the survey composing process into two phases: the Preparation and Generation phases. By innovatively introducing online reference retrieval, a pre-processing method called AttributeTree, and a re-polishing process, SurveyX significantly enhances the efficacy of survey composition. Experimental evaluation results show that SurveyX outperforms existing automated survey generation systems in content quality (0.259 improvement) and citation quality (1.76 enhancement), approaching human expert performance across multiple evaluation dimensions.

This paper identifies the misinterpretation of the context can be a significant issue during the reasoning process of large language models, spanning from smaller models like Llama3.2-3B-Instruct to cutting-edge ones like DeepSeek-R1. For example, in the phrase "10 dollars per kilo," LLMs might not recognize that "per" means "for each," leading to calculation errors. We introduce a novel, post-training approach called **Stick to the Facts (SIFT)** to tackle this. SIFT leverages increasing inference-time compute to ground LLM reasoning in contexts. At the core of SIFT lies the *Sticker*, which is generated by the model itself to explicitly emphasize the key information within the context. Given the curated Sticker, SIFT generates two predictions -- one from the original query and one from the query augmented with the Sticker. If they differ, the Sticker is sequentially refined via *forward* optimization (to better align the extracted facts with the query) and *inverse* generation (to conform with the model's inherent tendencies) for more faithful reasoning outcomes. Studies across diverse models (from 3B to 100B+) and benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, MATH-500) reveal consistent performance improvements. Notably, SIFT improves the pass@1 accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 on AIME2024 from 78.33% to **85.67**%, establishing a new state-of-the-art in the open-source community.

Understanding molecules is key to understanding organisms and driving advances in drug discovery, requiring interdisciplinary knowledge across chemistry and biology. Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in interpreting molecular structures, their instruction datasets are limited to the specific knowledge from task-oriented datasets and do not fully cover the fundamental characteristics of molecules, hindering their abilities as general-purpose molecular assistants. To address this issue, we propose Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules via multi-modal instruction tuning. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental features of molecules, incorporating essential knowledge from molecular structures. In addition, to improve understanding of molecular features, we introduce a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of different molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and generating relevant responses to users' queries with detailed explanations, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.

Large language models have demonstrated remarkable progress in mathematical reasoning, leveraging chain-of-thought and test-time compute scaling. However, many open questions remain regarding the interplay between reasoning token usage and accuracy gains. In particular, when comparing models across generations, it is unclear whether improved performance results from longer reasoning chains or more efficient reasoning. We systematically analyze chain-of-thought length across o1-mini and o3-mini variants on the Omni-MATH benchmark, finding that o3-mini (m) achieves superior accuracy without requiring longer reasoning chains than o1-mini. Moreover, we show that accuracy generally declines as reasoning chains grow across all models and compute settings, even when controlling for difficulty of the questions. This accuracy drop is significantly smaller in more proficient models, suggesting that new generations of reasoning models use test-time compute more effectively. Finally, we highlight that while o3-mini (h) achieves a marginal accuracy gain over o3-mini (m), it does so by allocating substantially more reasoning tokens across all problems, even the ones that o3-mini (m) can already solve. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between model capability and reasoning length, with implications for efficiency, scaling, and evaluation methodologies.

In this paper, we address the challenge of enforcing strict schema adherence in large language model (LLM) generation by leveraging LLM reasoning capabilities. Building on the DeepSeek R1 reinforcement learning framework, our approach trains structured reasoning skills of a 1.5B parameter model through a novel pipeline that combines synthetic reasoning dataset construction with custom reward functions under Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Specifically, we first perform R1 reinforcement learning on a 20K sample unstructured-to-structured dataset, mirroring the original DeepSeek R1 methods, to establish core reasoning abilities. Subsequently, we performed supervised fine-tuning on a separate 10K reasoning sample dataset, focusing on refining schema adherence for downstream tasks. Despite the relatively modest training scope, requiring approximately 20 hours on an 8xH100 GPU cluster for GRPO training and 3 hours on 1xA100 for SFT, our model demonstrates robust performance in enforcing schema consistency. We compare our ThinkJSON approach against the original DeepSeek R1 (671B), distilled versions of DeepSeek R1 (Qwen-1.5B and Qwen-7B), and Gemini 2.0 Flash (70B), showcasing its effectiveness in real-world applications. Our results underscore the practical utility of a resource-efficient framework for schema-constrained text generation.

Existing benchmarks do not test Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on their interactive intelligence with human users which is vital for developing general-purpose AI assistants. We design InterFeedback, an interactive framework, which can be applied to any LMM and dataset to assess this ability autonomously. On top of this, we introduce InterFeedback-Bench which evaluates interactive intelligence using two representative datasets, MMMU-Pro and MathVerse, to test 10 different open-source LMMs. Additionally, we present InterFeedback-Human, a newly collected dataset of 120 cases designed for manually testing interactive performance in leading models such as OpenAI-o1 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Our evaluation results show that even state-of-the-art LMM (like OpenAI-o1) can correct their results through human feedback less than 50%. Our findings point to the need for methods that can enhance the LMMs' capability to interpret and benefit from feedback.
