Over the past few decades, it has been extensively studied and has become crucial tool for Earth surface observation. CD plays significant role in various fields, including land-use change updates, natural disaster assessment, environmental monitoring, and urban planning. Early traditional CD methods primarily relied on image processing techniques, detecting changes by directly comparing pixel values or spectral features between multi-temporal images. Examples include Image Differencing [2], Change Vector Analysis (CVA) [3], Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [4], KauthThomas (KT) transforms [5], and Multivariate Alteration Detection (MAD) [6]. While these methods are simple and intuitive, they exhibit limited performance when handling complex change patterns, such as those affected by significant noise, lighting variations, or seasonal differences. With the rise of machine learning (ML), CD methods began to incorporate feature extraction and classifiers. Common techniques include Support Vector Machines (SVM) [7], Random Forest (RF) [8], K-means clustering [9] and so on. These machine learning approaches significantly improved detection Ziyuan Liu and Yuantao Gu are with the Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China (e-mail: liuziyua22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; gyt@tsinghua.edu.cn).

(Corresponding author: Yuantao Gu.) accuracy but heavily relied on high-quality labeled data and manually designed features. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning (DL) has revolutionized remote sensing CD, delivering substantial performance breakthroughs. DL-based CD methods generally involve three steps: (1) extracting change features from image pairs, (2) generating change maps based on the extracted features, and (3) predicting labels based on the feature maps. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which achieved remarkable success in image processing, were the first neural network architecture applied to remote sensing CD and remain widely optimized and utilized today [10] [12]. With the introduction of Transformers, some studies have explored their application in CD tasks [13], [14]. More recently, Foundational Model (FM) has emerged as novel paradigm, aiming to achieve multi-task and multidomain generalization through large-scale pretraining [15]. There have been works utilizing remote sensing data to finetune pretrained models such as Vision Transformers (ViT) [16], Segment Anything Model (SAM) [17], and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) [18], achieving higher performance in CD tasks [19][22]. Several semi-supervised methods have also been proposed, further improving CD performance under limited labeled data. Zhang et al. [23] propose novel multilevel consistency-regularization-based semi-supervised CD approach, incorporating Fourier-based frequency transformation and dynamic pseudolabel selection scheme to mitigate background noise and improve unlabeled data utilization. Xu et al. [24] introduce semi-supervised label and embedding consistency network (SS-LEC) for ORSI scene classification, which strategically enforces consistency across augmentations and stages of training. Li et al. [25] propose SemiCD-VL, VLM-guided semi-supervised change detection method that synthesizes pseudo labels via mixed change event generation strategy, achieving significant performance gains over FixMatch and SOTA unsupervised methods. However, DL-based CD methods generally face two major challenges: the scarcity of high-quality, high-resolution, all-inclusive CD datasets and limitations in handling highly dynamic change areas. Although numerous CD datasets have been constructed and proposed, they are often tailored to specific scenarios, which restricts the generalization capabilities of the algorithms. For instance, models trained on datasets focused on human-induced changes often fail to perform effectively when confronted with natural change scenarios. On the other hand, the learning capacity of these models IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING 2 Fig. 1. Timeline of the development of mainstream DL-based CD methods. is inherently limited. Most existing algorithms rely on single-phase training approach, typically end-to-end training, supplemented by techniques such as learning rate decay. While such training strategies can achieve satisfactory results within the models performance constrained range of changes, significantly degrades when addressing scenarios with wide variations in change areas, ranging from no change to complete change. To address the aforementioned challenges, we construct new large-scale, high-resolution, all-inclusive open-source CD dataset, named JL1-CD (named after the Jilin-1 satellite). This dataset comprises 5,000 pairs of 512 512 images captured"

Scaling the effective context length is essential for advancing large language models (LLMs) toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, the quadratic increase in computational complexity inherent in traditional attention mechanisms presents a prohibitive overhead. Existing approaches either impose strongly biased structures, such as sink or window attention which are task-specific, or radically modify the attention mechanism into linear approximations, whose performance in complex reasoning tasks remains inadequately explored.   In this work, we propose a solution that adheres to the ``less structure'' principle, allowing the model to determine where to attend autonomously, rather than introducing predefined biases. We introduce Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA), an innovative approach that applies the principles of Mixture of Experts (MoE) to the attention mechanism. This novel architecture demonstrates superior performance on long-context tasks while offering a key advantage: the ability to seamlessly transition between full and sparse attention, enhancing efficiency without the risk of compromising performance. MoBA has already been deployed to support Kimi's long-context requests and demonstrates significant advancements in efficient attention computation for LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/MoonshotAI/MoBA.

Deep learning has achieved significant success in the field of remote sensing image change detection (CD), yet two major challenges remain: the scarcity of sub-meter, all-inclusive open-source CD datasets, and the difficulty of achieving consistent and satisfactory detection results across images with varying change areas. To address these issues, we introduce the JL1-CD dataset, which contains 5,000 pairs of 512 x 512 pixel images with a resolution of 0.5 to 0.75 meters. Additionally, we propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation (MTKD) framework for CD. Experimental results on the JL1-CD and SYSU-CD datasets demonstrate that the MTKD framework significantly improves the performance of CD models with various network architectures and parameter sizes, achieving new state-of-the-art results. The code is available at https://github.com/circleLZY/MTKD-CD.
