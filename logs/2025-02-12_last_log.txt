[ 2 8 2 4 6 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aMulti-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to the need for excessive visual tokens. These tokens exceed massively the context length of MLLMs, resulting in filled by redundant task-irrelevant shots. How to select shots is an unsolved critical problem: sparse sampling risks missing key details, while exhaustive sampling overwhelms the model with irrelevant content, leading to video misunderstanding. To solve this problem, we propose Chain-ofShot prompting (CoS). The key idea is to frame shot selection as test-time visual prompt optimisation, choosing shots adaptive to video understanding semantic task by optimising shots-task alignment. CoS has two key parts: (1) binary video summary mechanism that performs pseudo temporal grounding, discovering binary coding to identify task-relevant shots, and (2) video coreasoning module that deploys the binary coding to pair (learning to align) task-relevant positive shots with irrelevant negative shots. It embeds the optimised shot selections into the original video, facilitating focus on relevant context to optimize long video understanding. Experiments across three baselines and five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of CoS. Code given in https://lwpyh.github.io/CoS. 1. Introduction Driven by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2023; Jiang et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025), researchers have extended LLMs to visual understanding tasks (Liu et al., 2024a; OpenAI, March 2024; Shu et al., 2024). By modality alignment and visual instruction tuning, MLLMs have demonstrated effectiveness in tasks such as captioning and visual question answering. Despite MLLMs perform well on single images and short videos (usually 1Queen Mary University of London 2Nanyang Technological University. Correspondence to: Jian Hu <jian.hu@qmul.ac.uk>. Preprint. Figure 1. The effects of changing shot-sampling rates on video understanding task performance on videos of different lengths in the VideoMME (Fu et al., 2024a) dataset. Two models are evaluated including LongVA (Zhang et al., 2024a) and VideoXL (Shu et al., 2024). As the number of sampled shots increased, performance did not consistently improve across various video lengths. That is because while sparse sampling may miss crucial details, exhaustive sampling often overwhelms the model with excessive irrelevant content. This illustrates the key challenge of optimal shot selection especially in long video understanding. That is, how to sample variable details in order to maximise semantic task information extraction whilst minimising distractions from irrelevant details (noise) in video understanding. under three minutes) (Zhu et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2024), understanding long videos, such as hour-long videos, remains significant problem unsolved (Zhang et al., 2024a). This challenge arises from the massive visual tokens generated in long videos by contemporary MLLMs, often exceeding the context length and computational capacity of these models, making it computationally intractable. Existing solutions to extend input capacity include token compression (Li et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024b; Xue et al., 2024) and specialised memory mechanisms (Song et al., 2024; He et al., 2024; Shu et al., 2024), all aimed at retaining critical information. However, as shown in Fig.1, task-relevant shots in long videos are sparsely distributed. Developing an effective sampling strategy is nontrivial and remains an open problem due to two main reasons. Sampling fewer shots reduces noise and helps the model focuses on relevant information but risks missing critical, sparsely distributed shots. Conversely, sampling more shots captures additional details CoS: Chain-of-Shot Prompting for Long Video Understanding Figure 2. The critical problem of how to select shots in video understanding. In video that depicts how boy gradually gains dragons trust, different sampling methods create two distinct narratives: split video shows the boy being attacked by the dragon, while split video shows him happily sharing food with the dragon. This shows that minor differences in video sampling leads to significant variations in semantic understanding (interpretation). but introduces significant noise, diluting critical insights. In essence, solution needs not only optimises (minimises) the number of shots by reducing redundancy and distractions, but also simultaneously captures (maximises) selectively task-relevant information by reducing omissions. Moreover, there is representation bias problem with existing methods: the role of visual shot selection in affecting models semantic reasoning process. Current MLLMs mainly process multi-modal inputs by encoding textual and visual information separately, before cross-modal alignment (Liu et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024a). While input quality can significantly affect performance, most research has focused only on optimising textual prompts for reasoning tasks, neglecting the importance of visual inputs. For example, VideoCoT (Wang et al., 2024c) relies on handcrafted textual prompts, while VoT (Fei et al., 2024a) uses video sense graphs or query decomposition to enhance reasoning. Such methods mainly refine text inputs but overlook the optimisation of visual inputs, which is essential for long videos when task-relevant information is sparsely distributed. As result, visual selection from the outset (input) becomes critical. That is illustrated in Fig.2, where different shot selections from the same video can lead to entirely different interpretations, demonstrating how video shots can serve as effective visual prompts to guide models reasoning process. However, this is missing in existing methods. This oversight highlights an unresolved issue: determining how to optimally sample shots that can effectively maximise task-relevant information selection whilst simultaneously minimise noise (distractions) in long-video understanding. In this work, we propose novel test-time optimisation strategy named Chain-of-Shot prompting (CoS). It consists of two parts: Binary Video Summary and Video CoReasoning. Binary Video Summary identifies sparsely distributed task-relevant shots by mosaicing based binary coding on long videos. It leverages MLLMs reasoning and sum"

Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to the need for excessive visual tokens. These tokens exceed massively the context length of MLLMs, resulting in filled by redundant task-irrelevant shots. How to select shots is an unsolved critical problem: sparse sampling risks missing key details, while exhaustive sampling overwhelms the model with irrelevant content, leading to video misunderstanding. To solve this problem, we propose Chain-of-Shot prompting (CoS). The key idea is to frame shot selection as test-time visual prompt optimisation, choosing shots adaptive to video understanding semantic task by optimising shots-task alignment. CoS has two key parts: (1) a binary video summary mechanism that performs pseudo temporal grounding, discovering a binary coding to identify task-relevant shots, and (2) a video co-reasoning module that deploys the binary coding to pair (learning to align) task-relevant positive shots with irrelevant negative shots. It embeds the optimised shot selections into the original video, facilitating a focus on relevant context to optimize long video understanding. Experiments across three baselines and five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of CoS. Code given in https://lwpyh.github.io/CoS.
