Text:"5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 7 0 8 6 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aOpenAIWe show that reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) significantly boosts performance on complex coding and reasoning tasks. Additionally, we compare two general-purpose reasoning models OpenAI o1 and an early checkpoint of o3 with domain-specific system, o1ioi, which uses hand-engineered inference strategies designed for competing in the 2024 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). We competed live at IOI 2024 with o1-ioi and, using hand-crafted test-time strategies, placed in the 49th percentile. Under relaxed competition constraints, o1-ioi achieved gold medal. However, when evaluating later models such as o3, we find that o3 achieves gold without hand-crafted domain-specific strategies or relaxed constraints. Our findings show that although specialized pipelines such as o1-ioi yield solid improvements, the scaled-up, general-purpose o3 model surpasses those results without relying on hand-crafted inference heuristics. Notably, o3 achieves gold medal at the 2024 IOI and obtains CodeForces rating on par with elite human competitors. Overall, these results indicate that scaling general-purpose reinforcement learning, rather than relying on domain-specific techniques, offers robust path toward state-of-the-art AI in reasoning domains, such as competitive programming.Competitive programming is widely recognized as challenging benchmark for evaluating reasoning and coding proficiency [2]. Solving complex algorithmic problems demands advanced computational thinking and problem solving skills. Moreover, these problems are also objectively gradable, making it an ideal testbed to assess the reasoning capabilities of AI systems. Recent work on program synthesis with large language models [1] has demonstrated that even relatively general models, ranging from 244M to 137B parameters, can generate short Python scripts from natural language instructions. Importantly, performance improves log-linearly with model size, and finetuning significantly boosts accuracy. Concurrently, Codex [2], an early code-focused LLM, excelled at Python program generation and powered GitHub Copilot. Further progress came from AlphaCode [7], which tackled competitive programming tasks using large-scale code generation and heuristics at inference, and the subsequent AlphaCode2[6], whose improvements nearly doubled AlphaCodes solved problems and placed it in the 85th percentile on the CodeForces platform. Both AlphaCode systems used large-scale sampling of up to million candidate solutions per problem before selecting their top 10 submissions with hand-engineered test-time strategy. Since then, significant progress has been made in harnessing reinforcement learning to improve LLMs language models reasoning skills. This has led to the emergence of large reasoning models (LRMs): trained via reinforcement learning to reason and think through extended chains of thought. In particular, OpenAIs o1 [4, 12] and its soon-to-be-released successor o3 [13] use chain-of-thought reasoning to tackle intricate tasks such as mathematics and coding. Work by DeepSeek-R1 [3] and Kimi k1.5 [15] independently illustrates how learning chain-of-thought boosts performance on both mathematical and programming challenges. An open question is how domain-specific, hand-engineered inference strategies compare to learned approaches that models generate and execute on their own. We have three systems available that can shed light on this question: o1, o1-ioi, and early checkpoints of o3. OpenAI o1 was the first large reasoning model and used general purpose methods to improve programming performance. Building on this foundation, o1-ioi was fine-tuned system tailored to compete in the 2024 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) and used test-time strategies similar to those used in the AlphaCode system. This specialization led to strong performance improvements on both the 2024 IOI and competitive programming platforms such as CodeForces. Subsequent advances led to the development of o3, which has Contributions listed in Appendix significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of AI models. Unlike o1-ioi or AlphaCode, o3 does not depend on coding-specific test-time strategies defined by humans. Instead, we found that complex testtime reasoning strategies emerged naturally from end-to-end RL, leading to unprecedented performance on competitive programming benchmarks. This report provides high-level overview of the importance of reasoning in coding tasks such as competitive programming, the progress of OpenAIs large reasoning models in programming ability, and our evaluation methodology and results on various competitive programming and coding benchmarks.We start with OpenAI o1, large language model trained with reinforcement learning to tackle complex reasoning tasks. By generating an extended internal chain of thought before answering [16], o1 resembles human who methodically works through challenging problem step by step. Reinforcement learning refines this chain-of-thought process, helping the model identify and correct errors, break down complex tasks into manageable parts, and explore alternate solution paths when an approach fails. These incontext reasoning capabilities substantially boost o1s overall performance on wide range of tasks. Additionally, OpenAI o1 is trained to use external tools [14], especially for writing and executing code in secure environment.1 This capability lets o1 verify whether its generated code compiles, passes provided test cases, and meets other correctness checks. By testing and refining its outputs, o1 iteratively improves its solutions over the course of single sample."

Text:"CODEI/O: Condensing Reasoning Patterns via Code Input-Output Prediction Junlong Li 1 2 3 * Daya Guo 1 Dejian Yang 1 Runxin Xu 1 Fan Zhou 2 Yu Wu 1 Junxian HeReasoning is fundamental capability of Large Language Models. While prior research predominantly focuses on enhancing narrow skills like math or code generation, improving performance on many other reasoning tasks remains challenging due to sparse and fragmented training data. To address this issue, we propose CODEI/O, novel approach that systematically condenses diverse reasoning patterns inherently embedded in contextually-grounded codes, through transforming the original code into code input-output prediction format. By training models to predict inputs/outputs given code and test cases entirely in natural language as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales, we expose them to universal reasoning primitiveslike logic flow planning, state-space searching, decision tree traversal, and modular decompositionwhile decoupling structured reasoning from code-specific syntax and preserving procedural rigor. Experimental results demonstrate CODEI/O leads to consistent improvements across symbolic, scientific, logic, math & numerical, and commonsense reasoning tasks. By matching the existing ground-truth outputs or re-executing the code with predicted inputs, we can verify each prediction and further enhance the CoTs through multi-turn revision, resulting in CODEI/O++ and achieving higher performance.

Current approaches, however, face fundamental paradox: while tasks like math problem solving (Shao et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2024; Ying et al., 2024; Toshniwal et al., 2024) and code generation (Roziere et al., 2023; Mistral-AI, 2024; Zhu et al., 2024; Hui et al., 2024) benefit from abundant structured training data, most other reasoning domainsincluding logical deduction, scientific inference, and symbolic reasoningsuffer from sparse and fragmented supervision signals. As result, it becomes crucial to identify training data that is rich in diverse reasoning patterns while remaining scalable to obtain. We believe that real-world code programs reflect the integration of wide range of reasoning patterns across diverse contexts, making them an ideal source for training while minimizing the risk of overfitting. However, conventional continual pre-training on raw code is suboptimal because the relevant reasoning signals are often implicit and intertwined with noisy information. Even the cleaner objective of directly training on text-to-code generation also faces challenges, as it is constrained by the requirement to generate code-specific syntax, making it difficult to generalize to tasks beyond code-specific ones. To address such limitations, we propose transforming raw code files into executable functions and designing more straightforward task: given function along with its corresponding textual query, the model needs to predict either the execution outputs given inputs or feasible inputs given outputs entirely in natural language as CoT rationales. This approach aims to disentangle core reasoning flow from code-specific syntax while preserving logical rigor. By gathering and transforming functions from diverse sources, the resulting data incorporates variety of foundational reasoning skills, such as logic flow orchestration, state-space exploration, recursive decomposition, and decision-making. Learning from these samples across the diverse contexts provided by the raw code files enables models to gain repeated exposure to these reasoning processes, allowing them to better internalize these skills. Similar to continual pre-training on raw code, our code input/output prediction learning is introduced as distinct training stage positioned before general instruction tuning CODEI/O: Condensing Reasoning Patterns via Code Input-Output Prediction Figure 1: Overview of our training data construction: Raw code files are gathered from various sources and converted into unified format. Input-output pairs are then generated by executing the code, while natural language CoTs for predictions are collected from DeepSeek-V2.5. The verified CoTs can undergo optional revisions to further enhance reasoning chains. in two-stage manner, serving as an intermediate step to enhance the reasoning abilities of the base model. The prompt includes the function, the textual query, and the given input or output, while the response is directly collected by prompting strong open-source model, DeepSeek-V2.5 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024). Notably, the instances for inputoutput prediction are highly scalable to collect, as we can sample hundreds of inputs from separate Python input generator for each function and execute the code to obtain ground-truth outputs. Finally, we collect over 450K functions from multiple sources, and for each function, several input-output pairs are generated by executing the corresponding code. Synthesizing CoTs for them results in total of 3.5M training samples, yielding the CODEI/O data. To further leverage the verifiable characteristics of code, we verify all predictions based on code execution and prompt DeepSeek-V2.5 for second turn of revisions on the responses it initially got wrong. These multi-turn revisions are concatenated into longer responses. The resulting CODEI/O++ dataset further enhances performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of this refinement process. We validate the effectiveness of CODEI/O and CODEI/O++ across four base models with parameter sizes ranging from 7B to 30B . Assessments across 14 different benchmarks show training on them enhances performance on diverse range of reasoning tasks, not only limited to code-related tasks but also more generalized"

Text:"February 2025 Scaling Pre-training to One Hundred Billion Data for Vision Language Models Xiao Wang, Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin, Daniel Salz, Zhe Li, Keran Rong and Xiaohua Zhai Corresponding Authors: {wangxiao, ibomohsin}@google.com We provide an empirical investigation of the potential of pre-training vision-language models on an unprecedented scale: 100 billion examples. We find that model performance tends to saturate at this scale on many common Western-centric classification and retrieval benchmarks, such as COCO Captions. Nevertheless, tasks of cultural diversity achieve more substantial gains from the 100-billion scale web data, thanks to its coverage of long-tail concepts. Furthermore, we analyze the models multilinguality and show gains in low-resource languages as well. In addition, we observe that reducing the size of the pretraining dataset via quality filters like using CLIP, typically used to enhance performance, may inadvertently reduce the cultural diversity represented even in large-scale datasets. Our results highlight that while traditional benchmarks may not benefit significantly from scaling noisy, raw web data to 100 billion examples, this data scale is vital for building truly inclusive multimodal systems. 1. Introduction The progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has been intrinsically linked to the availability of large-scale datasets. Larger datasets fuel the development of more powerful models, which are capable of understanding and generating complex relationships between images and text. In turn, such models have pushed boundaries in tasks like zero-shot image classification, image captioning and visual question answering. This relationship between data scale and model performance often follows power law 𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝛼 𝑥 𝑐 + 𝜀, where 𝑓 (𝑥) is model performance metric such as its error rate and 𝑥 is the data size [2, 8, 29, 33, 37, 38, 49, 58, 76].

However, the training techniques and data requirements to elicit Long CoT remain poorly understood. In this work, we find that Large Language model (LLM) can effectively learn Long CoT reasoning through data-efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA). With just 17k long CoT training samples, the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model achieves significant improvements on wide range of math and coding benchmarks, including 56.7% (+40.0%) on AIME 2024 and 57.0% (+8.1%) on LiveCodeBench, competitive to the proprietary o1preview models score of 44.6% and 59.1%. More importantly, we find that the structure of Long CoT is critical to the learning process, whereas the content of individual reasoning steps has minimal impact. Perturbations affecting content, such as training on incorrect samples or removing reasoning keywords, have little impact on performance. In contrast, structural modifications that disrupt logical consistency in the Long CoT, such as shuffling or deleting reasoning steps, significantly degrade accuracy. For example, model trained on Long CoT samples with incorrect answers still achieves only 3.2% lower accuracy compared to training with fully correct samples. These insights deepen our understanding of how to elicit reasoning capabilities in LLMs and highlight key considerations for efficiently training the next generation of reasoning models. This is the academic paper of our previous released Sky-T1-32B-Preview model. *Equal contribution 1Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley.

Introduction Large reasoning models (LRMs) leverage long chain-ofthoughts (Long CoTs) with reflection, backtracking, and self-validation to tackle challenging reasoning tasks (Jaech et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025; Team, 2024). However, the process of eliciting Long CoTs from available LLMs remains unclear, as existing methods are either closedsourced (Jaech et al., 2024; Team, 2024) or expensive to replicate (Guo et al., 2025). In this paper, we first show that, surprisingly, an LLM can be cheaply and easily taught to produce Long CoT responses, significantly improving its reasoning capabilities. In particular, we find that this learning process can be both dataefficient and parameter-efficient. By performing fully supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with only 17k samples generated by DeepSeek R1, the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model achieves performance competitive with OpenAI o1-preview across wide range of math and coding tasks (Team, 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Jaech et al., 2024). In particular, it achieves 90. 8% in Math-500 (+6.0%), 56.7% in AIME 2024 (+40.0%), 85.0% in AMC 2023 (+17.5%), 60.3% in OlympiadBench (+12.7%) and 57.0% in LiveCodeBench (+8.1%) (Jain et al., 2024). Even further, the model can achieve o1-preview performance by updating fewer than 5% parameters with LoRA fine-tuning (Hu et al., 2021). We show that the model successfully learns to reflect and revise its intermediate thoughts (e.g., frequently using reasoning keywords such as Alternatively and Wait, but) and adopts long, coherent CoTs to tackle challenging problems  (Fig. 1)  . Moreover, we identify the Long CoT structure as the key characteristic of distilled data for eliciting strong reasoning performance rather than the specific contents of individual reasoning steps within the Long CoT. To test this, we conduct two sets of controlled studies by altering either the content of individual reasoning steps or the overall logical structure. To alter content, we perturb samples by replacing numbers with random digits or deleting reasoning keywords. Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2025 (a) Responses of the base model, with Long CoT SFT, and with Long CoT LoRA. (b) Performance of different models on five difference reasoning benchmarks. Figure 1: Learning to reason is dataand parameter-efficient. When fine-tuned on small amount (17k) of Long CoT samples distilled and reject-sampled from DeepSeek-R1 with either LoRA or full-parameter tuning, the model easily learns to perform reflection and backtracking by using keywords such as However and Alternatively (Top). Consequently, the fine-tuned models improve significantly across five popular math and coding benchmarks (Bottom). For fine-tuning, the base model is Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct. Surprisingly, we find that these perturbations have little impact on the model performance: even when 50% of numbers in training samples are randomly changed, the model only observes 3.3% lower accuracy on the most challenging math benchmark, AIME 2024, as compared to training with correct samples. To alter the global reasoning structure, we separate responses into reasoning steps and randomly shuffle, insert, or delete these steps. We observe that the trained model is much more sensitive to structural perturbations that break logical coherency in the long CoT. For example, when 67% of the training samples reasoning steps are shuffled, accuracy drops by 13.3% on AIME 2024 problems relative to training with correct samples. In summary, our key contributions are: 1. We demonstrate that an LLM can learn Long CoT reasoning in data-efficient and parameter-efficient manner (i.e., LoRA). With fewer than 17k samples, we fine-tune the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to be competitive with o1-preview. 2. We identify the structure of Long CoT as critical to the learning process rather than the content of individual reasoning steps. To validate this finding, we perform two groups of controlled experiments that modify either the structure or contents of samples. 3. We conduct comprehensive ablations across model sizes and architectures, dataset sizes, data generation models (DeepSeek R1 and QwQ-32B-Preview), and on five popular math and coding reasoning benchmarks. 2 2.

[ 1 6 7 7 7 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract Prompt caching in large language models (LLMs) results in data-dependent timing variations: cached prompts are processed faster than noncached prompts. These timing differences introduce the risk of side-channel timing attacks. For example, if the cache is shared across users, an attacker could identify cached prompts from fast API response times to learn information about other users prompts. Because prompt caching may cause privacy leakage, transparency around the caching policies of API providers is important. To this end, we develop and conduct statistical audits to detect prompt caching in real-world LLM API providers. We detect global cache sharing across users in seven API providers, including OpenAI, resulting in potential privacy leakage about users prompts. Timing variations due to prompt caching can also result in leakage of information about model architecture. Namely, we find evidence that OpenAIs embedding model is decoder-only Transformer, which was previously not publicly known. 1. Introduction Transformer large language models (LLMs) are computationally expensive and slow to run. To address this challenge, recent work has developed optimizations to make LLM inference and serving more efficient, such as prompt caching (Zheng et al., 2024a; Gim et al., 2024). In prompt caching, reuse of the attention key-value (KV) cache across requests results in cache hits and faster response times for prompts that share prefix with cached prompt. However, prompt caching results in data-dependent timing variationscached prompts will be processed faster than non-cached prompts, introducing the risk of side-channel timing attacks and information leakage. In particular, an attacker could identify prompts that yield fast API response 1Stanford University. <cygu@cs.stanford.edu>, Gu <thashim@stanford.edu>. Correspondence to: Chenchen "

[ 1 7 2 5 7 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r NatureLM: Deciphering the Language of Nature for Scientific Discovery NatureLM team Microsoft Research AI for Science Abstract Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing and artificial intelligence, significantly enhancing how machines comprehend and generate human languages. Inspired by the success of these foundation models, researchers have developed foundation models for individual scientific domains, including small molecules, materials, proteins, DNA, and RNA. However, these models are typically trained in isolation, lacking the ability to integrate across different scientific domains. Recognizing that entities within these domains can all be represented as sequences, which together form the language of nature, we introduce Nature Language Model (briefly, NatureLM), sequence-based science foundation model designed for scientific discovery. Pre-trained with data from multiple scientific domains, NatureLM offers unified, versatile model that enables various applications including: (i) generating and optimizing small molecules, proteins, RNA, and materials using text instructions; (ii) cross-domain generation/design, such as protein-to-molecule and protein-to-RNA generation; and (iii) achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks like SMILES-to-IUPAC translation and retrosynthesis on USPTO-50k. NatureLM offers promising generalist approach for various scientific tasks, including drug discovery (hit generation/optimization, ADMET optimization, synthesis), novel material design, and the development of therapeutic proteins or nucleotides. We have developed NatureLM models in different sizes (1 billion, 8 billion, and 46.7 billion parameters) and observed clear improvement in performance as the model size increases.

We show that reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) significantly boosts performance on complex coding and reasoning tasks. Additionally, we compare two general-purpose reasoning models - OpenAI o1 and an early checkpoint of o3 - with a domain-specific system, o1-ioi, which uses hand-engineered inference strategies designed for competing in the 2024 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). We competed live at IOI 2024 with o1-ioi and, using hand-crafted test-time strategies, placed in the 49th percentile. Under relaxed competition constraints, o1-ioi achieved a gold medal. However, when evaluating later models such as o3, we find that o3 achieves gold without hand-crafted domain-specific strategies or relaxed constraints. Our findings show that although specialized pipelines such as o1-ioi yield solid improvements, the scaled-up, general-purpose o3 model surpasses those results without relying on hand-crafted inference heuristics. Notably, o3 achieves a gold medal at the 2024 IOI and obtains a Codeforces rating on par with elite human competitors. Overall, these results indicate that scaling general-purpose reinforcement learning, rather than relying on domain-specific techniques, offers a robust path toward state-of-the-art AI in reasoning domains, such as competitive programming.

To explore effective training protocols, we investigate scaling laws to identify the optimal recipe in data mixing ratios. By continual pre-training on Hephaestus-Forge, Hephaestus outperforms small- to medium-scale open-source LLMs and rivals commercial LLMs on three agent benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pre-training corpus in enhancing fundamental agentic capabilities and generalization of LLMs to new tasks or environments.

Reasoning is a fundamental capability of Large Language Models. While prior research predominantly focuses on enhancing narrow skills like math or code generation, improving performance on many other reasoning tasks remains challenging due to sparse and fragmented training data. To address this issue, we propose CodeI/O, a novel approach that systematically condenses diverse reasoning patterns inherently embedded in contextually-grounded codes, through transforming the original code into a code input-output prediction format. By training models to predict inputs/outputs given code and test cases entirely in natural language as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales, we expose them to universal reasoning primitives -- like logic flow planning, state-space searching, decision tree traversal, and modular decomposition -- while decoupling structured reasoning from code-specific syntax and preserving procedural rigor. Experimental results demonstrate CodeI/O leads to consistent improvements across symbolic, scientific, logic, math & numerical, and commonsense reasoning tasks. By matching the existing ground-truth outputs or re-executing the code with predicted inputs, we can verify each prediction and further enhance the CoTs through multi-turn revision, resulting in CodeI/O++ and achieving higher performance. Our data and models are available at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/CodeIO.

We provide an empirical investigation of the potential of pre-training vision-language models on an unprecedented scale: 100 billion examples. We find that model performance tends to saturate at this scale on many common Western-centric classification and retrieval benchmarks, such as COCO Captions. Nevertheless, tasks of cultural diversity achieve more substantial gains from the 100-billion scale web data, thanks to its coverage of long-tail concepts. Furthermore, we analyze the model's multilinguality and show gains in low-resource languages as well. In addition, we observe that reducing the size of the pretraining dataset via quality filters like using CLIP, typically used to enhance performance, may inadvertently reduce the cultural diversity represented even in large-scale datasets. Our results highlight that while traditional benchmarks may not benefit significantly from scaling noisy, raw web data to 100 billion examples, this data scale is vital for building truly inclusive multimodal systems.

Large reasoning models (LRMs) tackle complex reasoning problems by following long chain-of-thoughts (Long CoT) that incorporate reflection, backtracking, and self-validation. However, the training techniques and data requirements to elicit Long CoT remain poorly understood. In this work, we find that a Large Language model (LLM) can effectively learn Long CoT reasoning through data-efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA). With just 17k long CoT training samples, the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model achieves significant improvements on a wide range of math and coding benchmarks, including 56.7% (+40.0%) on AIME 2024 and 57.0% (+8.1%) on LiveCodeBench, competitive to the proprietary o1-preview model's score of 44.6% and 59.1%. More importantly, we find that the structure of Long CoT is critical to the learning process, whereas the content of individual reasoning steps has minimal impact. Perturbations affecting content, such as training on incorrect samples or removing reasoning keywords, have little impact on performance. In contrast, structural modifications that disrupt logical consistency in the Long CoT, such as shuffling or deleting reasoning steps, significantly degrade accuracy. For example, a model trained on Long CoT samples with incorrect answers still achieves only 3.2% lower accuracy compared to training with fully correct samples. These insights deepen our understanding of how to elicit reasoning capabilities in LLMs and highlight key considerations for efficiently training the next generation of reasoning models.

With just 17k long CoT training samples, the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model achieves significant improvements on a wide range of math and coding benchmarks, including 56.7% (+40.0%) on AIME 2024 and 57.0% (+8.1%) on LiveCodeBench, competitive to the proprietary o1-preview model's score of 44.6% and 59.1%. More importantly, we find that the structure of Long CoT is critical to the learning process, whereas the content of individual reasoning steps has minimal impact. Perturbations affecting content, such as training on incorrect samples or removing reasoning keywords, have little impact on performance. In contrast, structural modifications that disrupt logical consistency in the Long CoT, such as shuffling or deleting reasoning steps, significantly degrade accuracy. For example, a model trained on Long CoT samples with incorrect answers still achieves only 3.2% lower accuracy compared to training with fully correct samples. These insights deepen our understanding of how to elicit reasoning capabilities in LLMs and highlight key considerations for efficiently training the next generation of reasoning models. This is the academic paper of our previous released Sky-T1-32B-Preview model. Codes are available at https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyThought."

Prompt caching in large language models (LLMs) results in data-dependent timing variations: cached prompts are processed faster than non-cached prompts. These timing differences introduce the risk of side-channel timing attacks. For example, if the cache is shared across users, an attacker could identify cached prompts from fast API response times to learn information about other users' prompts. Because prompt caching may cause privacy leakage, transparency around the caching policies of API providers is important. To this end, we develop and conduct statistical audits to detect prompt caching in real-world LLM API providers. We detect global cache sharing across users in seven API providers, including OpenAI, resulting in potential privacy leakage about users' prompts. Timing variations due to prompt caching can also result in leakage of information about model architecture. Namely, we find evidence that OpenAI's embedding model is a decoder-only Transformer, which was previously not publicly known.

Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing and artificial intelligence, significantly enhancing how machines comprehend and generate human languages. Inspired by the success of these foundation models, researchers have developed foundation models for individual scientific domains, including small molecules, materials, proteins, DNA, and RNA. However, these models are typically trained in isolation, lacking the ability to integrate across different scientific domains. Recognizing that entities within these domains can all be represented as sequences, which together form the "language of nature", we introduce Nature Language Model (briefly, NatureLM), a sequence-based science foundation model designed for scientific discovery. Pre-trained with data from multiple scientific domains, NatureLM offers a unified, versatile model that enables various applications including: (i) generating and optimizing small molecules, proteins, RNA, and materials using text instructions; (ii) cross-domain generation/design, such as protein-to-molecule and protein-to-RNA generation; and (iii) achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks like SMILES-to-IUPAC translation and retrosynthesis on USPTO-50k. NatureLM offers a promising generalist approach for various scientific tasks, including drug discovery (hit generation/optimization, ADMET optimization, synthesis), novel material design, and the development of therapeutic proteins or nucleotides. We have developed NatureLM models in different sizes (1 billion, 8 billion, and 46.7 billion parameters) and observed a clear improvement in performance as the model size increases.
