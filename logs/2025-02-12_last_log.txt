Text:"5 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 0 4 6 7 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Technical Report Goedel-Prover: Frontier Model for Open-Source Automated Theorem Proving Yong Lin Shange Tang Bohan Lyu Jiayun Wu Hongzhou Lin Kaiyu Yang Jia Li Mengzhou Xia Danqi Chen Sanjeev Arora Chi JinWe introduce Goedel-Prover, an open-source large language model (LLM) that achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in automated formal proof generation for mathematical problems. The key challenge in this field is the scarcity of formalized math statements and proofs, which we tackle in the following ways. We train statement formalizers to translate the natural language math problems from Numina into formal language (Lean 4), creating dataset of 1.64 million formal statements. LLMs are used to check that the formal statements accurately preserve the content of the original natural language problems. We then iteratively build large dataset of formal proofs by training series of provers. Each prover succeeds in proving many statements that the previous ones could not, and these new proofs are added to the training set for the next prover. The final prover outperforms all existing open-source models in whole-proof generation. On the miniF2F benchmark, it achieves 57.6% success rate (Pass@32), exceeding the previous best open-source model by 7.6%. On PutnamBench, Goedel-Prover successfully solves 7 problems (Pass@512), ranking first on the leaderboard. Furthermore, it generates 29.7K formal proofs for Lean Workbook problems, nearly doubling the 15.7K produced by earlier works.Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks, especially in solving mathematical problems (Guo et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024a). These models excel at reasoning through natural language, which we refer to informal reasoning. However, natural language-based reasoning is difficult to automatically verify by machines, which undermines the reliability of informal reasoning in practical applications. This also makes it more difficult to further improve the reasoning capabilities of language models. In contrast to informal reasoning, formal reasoning allows reasoning in machine-verifiable format, opening up new possibilities for verification and automation. In particular, proof assistants such as Lean (De Moura et al., 2015; Moura & Ullrich, 2021), Isabelle (Paulson, 1994), and Coq (Barras et al., 1997) provide formal languages that can express reasoning in way that can be mechanically verified. Thus, it is of great interest to train LLMs to write proofs in these formal languages. significant challenge in training LLMs for theorem proving in formal languages is the scarcity of formalized math statements and proofs. Writing proofs for theorems expressed in formal languages is highly demanding and necessitates considerable domain expertise.

Numina. 1 Technical Report (Left) The performance of Pass@32 for whole-proof generation on miniF2F Figure 1: comparing with previous SOTA models. (Middle) comparison of Goedel-Prover-SFT and DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 in terms of miniF2F performance across different inference budgets, ranging from Pass@32, 64, 128, ..., to 4 6400. (Right) Goedel-Prover-SFT solve 29.7K problems in Lean Workbook. Previously, InternLM2.5-Step-Prover (Wu et al., 2024) and InternLM-Math-Plus (Ying et al., 2024b) collectively solved 15.7K samples. Therefore, existing publicly available datasets for formal languages are limited in size. For example, the Lean Workbook (including Lean Workbook Plus) dataset (Ying et al., 2024a; Wu et al., 2024) comprises total of 140K formal statements, where formal statements refer to problem statements in Lean without proofs. However, only 15.7K of these statements come with formal proofs, which were found by InternLM2.5-StepProver and InternLM-Math-Plus (Ying et al., 2024a; Wu et al., 2024; Ying et al., 2024b). Additionally, the Open Bootstrapped Theorems dataset (Wang et al., 2024) includes 107K statements with proofs sourced from Mathlib44 (mathlib4, 2023). However, we observe notable difference in the distribution of Mathlib4 compared to that of general problem-solving benchmarks, such as the widely used miniF2F (Zheng et al., 2021). For instance, statements in miniF2F are primarily from high school and require complex reasoning abilities to solve, whereas those in Mathlib4 focus on the simple manipulation of advanced mathematical concepts. (see Figure 7 and 8 in the appendix for comparison). Furthermore, we find that incorporating Mathlib4 data into training does not consistently improve performance on miniF2F (Section 4). In contrast to the scarcity of data in formal languages, there is vast amount of math problems and solutions written in informal language. For example, Numina (Li et al., 2024a) includes 860K high-quality question and answer pairs sourced from MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), AMC (aop), AIME (MAA, 2024), the AoPS Forum (aop), Chinese K-12 Exams (Shao et al., 2024), World Olympiads, and synthetic data (Mitra et al., 2024). We start by training LLMs to formalize the problem statements in these datasets into Lean language. To increase the diversity of the formalization styles, we train two formalizers. One is trained on informal and formal (I-F) statement pairs from Lean Workbook, while the other is trained on I-F statement pairs annotated by Claude-sonnet-3.5 (Anthropic, 2024). We use these two formalizers to formalize the statements and then employ LLMs to ensure that the formal statements preserve the content of the informal statements. Our efforts result in 1.64 million formal statements. Using this extensive dataset of formal statements, we employ expert iteration (Polu et al., 2022) to train the prover to generate proofs. Notably, we train model to generate complete proofs solely based on statements, without interacting with the Lean compiler during the generation process. This approach is referred to as the whole-proof generation method (Jiang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024a;b). At the beginning of the expert iteration, we generate 16 proof candidates using DeepSeek-Prover-V"

To truly understand vision models, we must not only interpret their learned features but also validate these interpretations through controlled experiments. Current approaches either provide interpretable features without the ability to test their causal influence, or enable model editing without interpretable controls. We present a unified framework using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) that bridges this gap, allowing us to discover human-interpretable visual features and precisely manipulate them to test hypotheses about model behavior. By applying our method to state-of-the-art vision models, we reveal key differences in the semantic abstractions learned by models with different pre-training objectives. We then demonstrate the practical usage of our framework through controlled interventions across multiple vision tasks. We show that SAEs can reliably identify and manipulate interpretable visual features without model re-training, providing a powerful tool for understanding and controlling vision model behavior. We provide code, demos and models on our project website: https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/SAE-V.

We introduce Goedel-Prover, an open-source large language model (LLM) that achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in automated formal proof generation for mathematical problems. The key challenge in this field is the scarcity of formalized math statements and proofs, which we tackle in the following ways. We train statement formalizers to translate the natural language math problems from Numina into formal language (Lean 4), creating a dataset of 1.64 million formal statements. LLMs are used to check that the formal statements accurately preserve the content of the original natural language problems. We then iteratively build a large dataset of formal proofs by training a series of provers. Each prover succeeds in proving many statements that the previous ones could not, and these new proofs are added to the training set for the next prover. The final prover outperforms all existing open-source models in whole-proof generation. On the miniF2F benchmark, it achieves a 57.6% success rate (Pass@32), exceeding the previous best open-source model by 7.6%. On PutnamBench, Goedel-Prover successfully solves 7 problems (Pass@512), ranking first on the leaderboard. Furthermore, it generates 29.7K formal proofs for Lean Workbook problems, nearly doubling the 15.7K produced by earlier works.

"We introduce Goedel-Prover, an open-source large language model (LLM) that achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in automated formal proof generation for mathematical problems. The key challenge in this field is the scarcity of formalized math statements and proofs, which we tackle in the following ways. We train statement formalizers to translate the natural language math problems from Numina into formal language (Lean 4), creating a dataset of 1.64 million formal statements. LLMs are used to check that the formal statements accurately preserve the content of the original natural language problems. We then iteratively build a large dataset of formal proofs by training a series of provers. Each prover succeeds in proving many statements that the previous ones could not, and these new proofs are added to the training set for the next prover. The final prover outperforms all existing open-source models in whole-proof generation. On the miniF2F benchmark, it achieves a 57.6% success rate (Pass@32), exceeding the previous best open-source model by 7.6%. On PutnamBench, Goedel-Prover successfully solves 7 problems (Pass@512), ranking first on the leaderboard. Furthermore, it generates 29.7K formal proofs for Lean Workbook problems, nearly doubling the 15.7K produced by earlier works."
