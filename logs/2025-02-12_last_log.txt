However, traditional texttrained or numeric similarity-based retrieval methods often struggle to handle the intricacies of financial data. To address this, we propose the first retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for financial time-series forecasting. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: fine-tuned 1B large language model (StockLLM) as its backbone, novel candidate selection method enhanced by LLM feedback, and training objective that maximizes the similarity between queries and historically significant sequences. These advancements enable our retriever, FinSeer, to uncover meaningful patterns while effectively minimizing noise in complex financial datasets. To support robust evaluation, we also construct new datasets that integrate financial indicators and historical stock prices. Experimental results demonstrate that our RAG framework outperforms both the baseline StockLLM and random retrieval methods, showcasing its effectiveness. FinSeer, as the retriever, achieves an 8% higher accuracy on the BIGDATA22 benchmark and retrieves more impactful sequences compared to existing retrieval methods. This work highlights the importance of tailored retrieval models in fin"

Text:"Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction: Pay Less Attention to Learn More Xialie Zhuang * 1 2 Zhikai Jia * 2 Jianjin Li * 3 Zhenyu Zhang 4 Li Shen 5 Zheng Cao 2 Shiwei Liu1. Introduction 5 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 0 9 4 7 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Large Language Models (LLMs) are discovered to suffer from accurately retrieving key information. To address this, we propose Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction (MEAP), simple yet effective training paradigm that seamlessly integrates Masked Language Modeling (MLM) into Next-Token Prediction (NTP) to enhance the latters in-context retrieval capabilities. Specifically, MEAP first randomly masks small fraction of input tokens and then directly performs the standard next-token prediction autoregressive using decoder-only Transformer. MEAP eliminates the need for bidirectional attention or encoderdecoder architectures for MLM, incurring no additional computational overhead during pre-training or inference. Intensive experiments demonstrate that MEAP substantially outperforms NTP on key information retrieval and long-context reasoning tasks, while performing on par or better on commonsense reasoning tasks. The benefits of MEAP also extend to supervised fine-tuning, where it shows remarkable advantages in lostin-the-middle scenarios, outperforming NTP by 11.77% percentage points. Our analysis indicates that MEAPs effectiveness arises from its ability to promote more distinguishable attention scores by concentrating on reduced set of non-masked tokens. This mechanism improves the models focus on task-relevant signals while mitigating the influence of peripheral context. These findings position MEAP as promising training paradigm for large language models.Code is provided in the link. *Equal contribution 1School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China 2SCITIX (SGP) TECH PTE.

Correspondence to: Zheng Cao <zcao@scitix.ai>, Shiwei Liu <shiwei.liu@maths.ox.ac.uk>. The entire development process relies on the Siflow platform (https://scitix.ai/), provided by SCITIX (SGP) TECH PTE. LTD. 1 Next-token prediction (NTP) (Radford, 2018) is the foundational training objective for many large language models (LLMs), including OpenAIs GPT series (Brown, 2020). NTP trains models to predict the next word (or token) in sequence, given all preceding tokens. Its scaling efficiency and exceptional performance in text generation have established it as the dominant paradigm for state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023), LLaMa3 (Dubey et al., 2024), Gemini 1.5 Pro (Team et al., 2024), and DeepSeekV3 (Liu et al., 2024a). However, recent studies highlight the limitations of NTP-based LLMs in accurately retrieving key information from context (Liu et al., 2024b; Kamradt, 2023). In contrast, masked language modeling (MLM), used in BERT (Devlin, 2018), adopts denoising objective that reconstructs masked inputs using bidirectional attention. This cloze-type nature makes MLM particularly effective for tasks requiring precise information retrieval and sentencelevel understanding. However, MLMs inherent focus on reconstructing masked tokens reduces its effectiveness in tasks requiring coherent and long-form text generation (Wang & Cho, 2019; Dong et al., 2019). While intuitively appealing, combining NTP and MLM to leverage their respective strengths remains non-trivial challenge. MLM typically operates best within two-stack encoder-decoder architectures, and performance degrades significantly when applied to decoder-only Transformers (Tay et al., 2022). Efforts to integrate the two often rely on unified pre-training pipelines where multiple objectives are alternated during the pretraining process (Dong et al., 2019; Tay et al., 2022). However, this multi-objective approach introduces substantial complexity to the training pipeline, making it cumbersome to scale, especially for models with billions or trillions of parameters. To this end, we propose Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction (MEAP), simple yet effective LLM training paradigm that seamlessly integrates masked tokens into next-token prediction. Specifically, we first randomly mask small fraction of the input tokens and then directly perform standard next-token prediction using decoder-only Transformer in an autoregressive manner. This straightforward modification eliminates the need for bidirectional attention Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction: Pay Less Attention to Learn More respectively. In Section 5, we further analyze the underlying reasons for MEAPs effectiveness. Section 6 provides an ablation study, and we conclude the paper in Section 7. 2. Related Work Masked Language Modeling. Pre-training is one of the most important pillars of LLMs. BERT first trained bidirectional, encoder-only Transformer with masked language modeling (MLM), where the model is trained to predict masked input tokens. XLNet (Yang, 2019) introduced the Permutation-based Language Modeling to account for dependencies between masked tokens during training. RoBERTa(Liu, 2019) further improves the pre-training of BERT by training the model longer, over more data, with longer sequences, etc. MLM was further advanced by T5 (Roberts et al., 2019). Specifically, T5 frames every text processing task as text-to-text problem, leveraging increased lengths of corrupted tokens to achieve improved performance on classification tasks, which has contributed to its growing popularity. However, these models have shown limited performance in open-text generation and in-context learning, limiting their usage in modern LLMs. Next Token Prediction. In parallel vein, Radford et al. (2019) proposed next-token prediction (NTP) where decoder-only Transformer is trained to predict the next token from left to right using unidirectional attention ensured by casual mask. By predicting the next token based on previously generated tokens and the given input context, NTP maintains coherence and logical flow in the generated text, well-suited for text generation. Moreover, NTP eliminates the need for an encoder, significantly improving the scalability of language models. Due to the above advantages, NTP serves as the most popular pre-training objective of modern LLMs (Brown, 2020; Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a)."

In practice, practitioners often take guidance from scaling laws that assume completely different design choices than their own implementation, often without understanding to degree to which these choices may impact optimal scaling. In this work, we produce vast array of model checkpoints 1University of Maryland 2Columbia University. Correspondence to: Sean McLeish <smcleish@umd.edu>. for studying how model design and model selection impact scaling laws. Our models, called the Gemstones because they are loosely based on scaled-down variants of the Gemma architecture, vary in their parameter count, width/depth ratio, learning rates, and training tokens, cooldown schedules. By fitting scaling laws to these checkpoints, we confirm that scaling law parameters and interpretations indeed depend strongly on the selection of models and fitting procedure used, and we quantify the degree to which these decisions impact predictions. By exploiting the variation among our model checkpoints, we also fit number of unique scaling laws and analyze their predictions to discern whether they are consistent with design choices we see in industry models. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We open-source more than 4000 checkpoints cumulatively trained on over 10 trillion tokens. The models we provide are diverse across architectural and training hyperparameter axes, enabling more granular studies than previous work (see Figure 2). We highlight the fragility and common pitfalls of prior scaling laws. There are many decisions to make when choosing points to fit scaling laws that significantly change the slope of the law (see Figure 6). We modify standard scaling laws to account for the width and depth of models. Our scaling laws estimate not only parameter count, but also the optimal aspect ratio for any given training budget. We compare our estimates to industrial models (see Figure 5). We modify scaling laws to account for practical considerations like GPU efficiency and overtraining. When distorted to account for training and inference costs, scaling laws predict considerably wider and shallower models (see Figure 7). We consider what happens when scaling laws are inaccurate. Given that scaling laws are quite sensitive to design decisions, it is natural to ask how best to cope with their imperfections. We find that it is much better to err on the side of wider models than narrow ones. We also find that it is better to err on the side of smaller models, as overtraining is quite efficient (see Figure 8). 1 Gemstones: Model Suite for Multi-Faceted Scaling Laws 2. Related Work 2.1. Scaling Laws Scaling laws address the trade-off between parameter count and number of training tokens, attempting to find the minimum loss possible for language model with constrained FLOP budget. Unfortunately, scaling laws treat model design and training as if it has single dimension (parameter count). In reality, training is sensitive to many choices. Notably, Hoffmann et al. (2022) find significantly different fitted laws (Equation (1)) compared to Kaplan et al. (2020). Pearce & Song (2024) and Porian et al. (2024) attribute most of this discrepancy to the choice to exclude embedding parameters from the parameter count, both showing one law can be transformed into the other via controlled changes. Kaplan et al. (2020) justify including embedding parameters by showing that non-embedding parameters have cleaner relationship with test loss. Scaling laws are also commonly included in many large model releases (Hu et al., 2024; Bi et al., 2024; Dubey et al., 2024). Choshen et al. (2024) collect both loss and benchmark performance metrics for multitude of models and offer practitioners guide to fitting scaling laws. Most notably, they suggest 5 models are ample to fit scaling law, and the early period of training should be excluded from the analysis. In contrast, Li et al. (2024b) show that selecting data according to different tokens-per-parameter ratios and using small grid searches when fitting scaling laws can cause big swings in outcomes. Hagele et al. (2024) suggest that constant learning rate plus cooldown is preferable to cosine learning rate schedule. The authors also find that stochastic weight averaging should be encouraged in scaling law analysis as it tends to lead to better models. Furthermore, Inbar & Sernau (2024) observe that FLOPs cannot be used to predict wall-clock time nor memory movement, and suggest that fast-training architectures may be preferred over those prescribed by scaling laws. There are multiple works analyzing whether scaling laws can be used to predict downstream performance. Ruan et al. (2024) show that scaling laws can be predictive of benchmar"

Stock movement prediction, a fundamental task in financial time-series forecasting, requires identifying and retrieving critical influencing factors from vast amounts of time-series data. However, existing text-trained or numeric similarity-based retrieval methods fall short in handling complex financial analysis. To address this, we propose the first retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for financial time-series forecasting, featuring three key innovations: a fine-tuned 1B parameter large language model (StockLLM) as the backbone, a novel candidate selection method leveraging LLM feedback, and a training objective that maximizes similarity between queries and historically significant sequences. This enables our retriever, FinSeer, to uncover meaningful patterns while minimizing noise in complex financial data. We also construct new datasets integrating financial indicators and historical stock prices to train FinSeer and ensure robust evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our RAG framework outperforms bare StockLLM and random retrieval, highlighting its effectiveness, while FinSeer surpasses existing retrieval methods, achieving an 8\% higher accuracy on BIGDATA22 and retrieving more impactful sequences. This work underscores the importance of tailored retrieval models in financial forecasting and provides a novel framework for future research.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are discovered to suffer from accurately retrieving key information. To address this, we propose Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction (MEAP), a simple yet effective training paradigm that seamlessly integrates Masked Language Modeling (MLM) into Next-Token Prediction (NTP) to enhance the latter's in-context retrieval capabilities. Specifically, MEAP first randomly masks a small fraction of input tokens and then directly performs the standard next-token prediction autoregressive using a decoder-only Transformer. MEAP eliminates the need for bidirectional attention or encoder-decoder architectures for MLM, incurring no additional computational overhead during pre-training or inference. Intensive experiments demonstrate that MEAP substantially outperforms NTP on key information retrieval and long-context reasoning tasks, while performing on par or better on commonsense reasoning tasks. The benefits of MEAP also extend to supervised fine-tuning, where it shows remarkable advantages in lost-in-the-middle scenarios, outperforming NTP by 11.77 percentage points. Our analysis indicates that MEAP's effectiveness arises from its ability to promote more distinguishable attention scores by concentrating on a reduced set of non-masked tokens. This mechanism improves the model's focus on task-relevant signals while mitigating the influence of peripheral context. These findings position MEAP as a promising training paradigm for large language models.

Scaling laws are typically fit using a family of models with a narrow range of frozen hyper-parameter choices. In this work we study scaling laws using a wide range of architecture and hyper-parameter choices, and highlight their impact on resulting prescriptions. As a primary artifact of our research, we release the Gemstones: the most comprehensive open-source scaling law dataset to date, consisting of over 4000 checkpoints from transformers with up to 2 billion parameters; these models have been trained with different learning rates, cooldown schedules, and architectural shapes. Our checkpoints enable more complex studies of scaling, such as a law that predicts language modeling performance as a function of model width and depth. By examining the various facets of our model suite, we find that the prescriptions of scaling laws can be highly sensitive to the experimental design process and the specific model checkpoints used during fitting.
