Text:"CAD-Editor: Locate-then-Infill Framework with Automated Training Data Synthesis for Text-Based CAD Editing Yu Yuan 1 Shizhao Sun 2 Qi Liu 1 Jiang BianComputer Aided Design (CAD) is indispensable across various industries. Text-based CAD editing, which automates the modification of CAD models based on textual instructions, holds great potential but remains underexplored. Existing methods primarily focus on design variation generation or text-based CAD generation, either lacking support for text-based control or neglecting existing CAD models as constraints. We introduce CAD-Editor, the first framework for text-based CAD editing. To address the challenge of demanding triplet data with accurate correspondence for training, we propose an automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline utilizes design variation models to generate pairs of original and edited CAD models and employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to summarize their differences into editing instructions.

Introduction In the modern digital era, Computer-Aided Design (CAD) has become indispensable across industries. Most modern CAD tools follow the Sketch-and-Extrude (SE) Operations paradigm (Shahin, 2008; Camba et al., 2016), where Work done during the internship at Microsoft Research Asia. The paper is the result of an open-source research project starting 1University of Science and Technology of from March 2024. China 2Microsoft Research Asia. Correspondence to: Shizhao Sun <shizsu@microsoft.com>. Preprint. Under review. 1 designers sketch 2D curves to define the outer and inner boundaries of profiles, extrude them into 3D shapes, and combine these shapes to create complex models. CAD model creation is an iterative process, where an initial draft undergoes multiple modifications until it aligns with user requirements. Natural language plays crucial role throughout this process, serving as key medium of communication. For non-experts, it offers the most intuitive way to express their needs, while for professionals, it enables fast, detailed, and precise instructions. Consequently, system capable of automatically editing CAD models based on textual instructions known as text-based CAD editing (Figure 1) has the potential to revolutionize the entire CAD design workflow. Such system could significantly accelerate CAD model development and empower broader range of individuals, especially those with limited design expertise, to create CAD models more effectively. While important, text-based CAD editing receives limited attention. Some studies explore design variation generation, where new CAD models are generated by randomly altering components of an existing model (Wu et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022; 2023; Zhang et al., 2024b). However, these approaches lack support for text-based control over the appearance of the generated CAD models, limiting their practical usability. Another line of research makes initial attempts at text-based CAD generation, focusing on generating new CAD models directly from textual descriptions (Khan et al., 2024b). Nonetheless, these methods do not incorporate an existing CAD model as input, which prevents them from leveraging the original designs context and constraints. Text-based CAD editing presents several distinct challenges. First, training for this task requires triplet data with accurate correspondence among an original CAD model, an editing instruction and an edited CAD model. However, such data does not naturally exist, and manually collection is both costly and difficult to scale. Second, text-based CAD editing is inherently composite problem. It demands comprehensive understanding of the textual description, the ability to locate the corresponding parts within the intricate structure of the CADs SE operations, and the capability to generate concrete modifications to these SE operations. CAD-Editor Figure 1. Text-based CAD editing achieved by CAD-Editor. Each sub-figure shows the editing instruction at the top, the original CAD model on the left, and the edited CAD model on the right. The rendered image is shown for better comprehension. The actual editing occurs on sketch-and-extrusion (SE) operations of CAD model to provide editability and reusability. In this work, we introduce CAD-Editor, the first framework for text-based CAD editing. We frame the task as sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) generation problem, where the input combines an editing instruction and the sequence representation of the original CAD model, and the output is the sequence of the edited CAD model (Figure 2). To address the need for triplet data with accurate correspondence, we propose an automated data synthesis pipeline that leverages existing design variation models and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) (Figure 3). Starting from an existing CAD model, design variation models generate edited CAD models by randomly altering parts while keeping others unchanged, producing pairs of original and edited CAD models. LVLMs then summarize the differences between these CAD models into editing instructions, resulting in triplets with strong correspondence. To tackle the composite nature of text-based CAD editing, we decompose the task into specialized sub-tasks: locating and infilling, each addressing specific aspect of the editing process (Figure 4). For both sub-tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as the backbone, leveraging their natural language understanding and CAD design knowledge (Makatura et al., 2023). In the locating stage, LLMs identify regions requiring modification by generating masked CAD sequence, where special tokens <mask> indicate the regions to be modified. In the infilling stage, LLMs generate appropriate edits for these masked regions, using the masked CAD sequence from the locating stage as context. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We introduce new task, text-based CAD editing, enabling precise edits through textual instruction"

[ 1 2 9 4 3 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aTeaching large language models (LLMs) to critique and refine their outputs is crucial for building systems that can iteratively improve, yet it is fundamentally limited by the ability to provide accurate judgments and actionable suggestions. In this work, we study LLM critics for code generation and propose CTRL, framework for Critic Training via Reinforcement Learning, which trains critic model to generate feedback that maximizes correction performance for fixed generator model without human supervision. Our results demonstrate that critics trained with CTRL significantly enhance pass rates and mitigate compounding errors across both base and stronger generator models. Furthermore, we show that these critic models act as accurate generative reward models and enable test-time scaling through iterative critique-revision, achieving up to 106.1% relative improvements across challenging code generation benchmarks. 1. Introduction Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential for self-improvement through iterative feedback mechanisms (Pan et al., 2023). Methods like Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2024) and Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2024) demonstrate that LLMs can, in principle, critique their own outputs and generate refined responses. This self-improvement paradigm offers promising direction toward more autonomous AI systems that can learn from their mistakes. However, the effectiveness of such self-improvement mechanisms remains challenging in practice. Huang et al. (2023) demonstrate that without appropriate external feedback, such self-improvement loops may lead to performance degradation. To address this, existing approaches primarily rely on reward models (Sun et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2024) *Equal contribution 1The University of Hong Kong 2Bytedance, Seed. Correspondence to: Zhihui Xie <zhxieml@gmail.com>. Figure 1. Performance scaling of our CTRL critic (finetuned on Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Ins, henceforth Qwen2.5-Coder) compared to other critics across different generators on CodeContests. CTRL demonstrates strong critiquing capabilities not only when paired with its base model but also with stronger generator (GPT-4o, right). Shaded regions indicate standard error across 5 seeds. or automated verification tools (Gou et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023). However, these mechanisms often fail to provide actionable guidance reward models compress complex evaluation criteria into simplified numerical signals (Gao et al., 2023; Pan et al., 2024), while verification tools generate low-level execution traces that do not directly translate to high-level fixes (Zhong et al., 2024). Even in domains like code generation (Li et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2024) where such feedback mechanisms are readily available, previous work (Zheng et al., 2024) as well as our experiment  (Table 1)  reveal that such feedback alone struggles to drive meaningful improvements. At the heart of this issue lies the feedback bottleneck: feedback needs to both accurately discriminate the correctness of solutions and provide informative yet actionable suggestions for improvement. To address these challenges, we propose CTRL (Critic Training via Reinforcement Learning), framework that decouples the critic model from the task-performing model (e.g., GPT-4o) and focus on developing specialized critic that can effectively drive the task-performing model toward optimal solution generation through iterative critiquerevisions (Figure 2). This decomposition naturally introduces well-defined proxy task for training the critic model: while directly evaluating the quality of generated critiques remains challenging, the effectiveness of critic can be 1 Teaching Language Models to Critique via Reinforcement Learning Figure 2. Illustration of the critique-correction process for coding problem. Top: An initial solution is proposed by the task-performing using min-heap approach. Bottom: The critic identifies flaws in the implementation (incorrect heap access and inefficient query handling) and suggests specific improvements, leading to corrected max-heap solution. This example is taken from critiques of CTRL on LiveCodeBench, which demonstrates how structured feedback from the critic can guide meaningful improvements in code generation. measured by its ability to drive the task-performing model toward correct outputs. Though such indirect optimization signals lead to large space of possible critiques and therefore high variance during training, we address this through two-stage pipeline: first synthesizing high-quality critiques using execution feedback for supervised finetuning, then optimizing the critic through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO; Shao et al. 2024). et Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks including CodeContests al., 2022), Live- (Li CodeBench (Jain et al., 2024), MBPP+ (Liu et al., 2024a), and JudgeBench (Tan et al., 2024), we demonstrate that training with CTRL significantly outperforms both self-critique approaches and methods using stronger critic models. Notably, we observe remarkable generalization capabilities of the decoupled critic LLM across different problem domains and model scales. Our experiments demonstrate that relatively weaker critic models can effectively guide stronger task-performing models such as GPT-4o  (Table 3)  , exhibiting similar phenomenon to weak-to-strong generalization (Christiano et al., 2018; Burns et al., 2023), where weaker models can be trained to effectively supervise more capable ones. Furthermore, CTRL enables efficient test-time scaling (Figure 1). By providing targeted and actionable feedback, our critic significantly reduces the number of revision iterations needed, leading to both lower token consumption and higher success rates. Our empirical analysis (Figure 4) demonstrates that this efficiency stems from reduced error compoundingthe critic effectively identifies and corrects mistakes early, guiding the model toward more direct solution paths without compromising solution quality. Our work makes four key contributions: (1) We propose CTRL, novel framework that decouples critic LLMs from task-performing models and trains them through two-stage GRPO to guide code improvement.

In this technical report, we present Magic 1-For-1 (Magic141), an efficient video generation model with optimized memory consumption and inference latency. The key idea is simple: factorize the text-to-video generation task into two separate easier tasks for diffusion step distillation, namely text-to-image generation and image-to-video generation. We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification. With those techniques, we are able to generate 5-second video clips within 3 seconds. By applying a test time sliding window, we are able to generate a minute-long video within one minute with significantly improved visual quality and motion dynamics, spending less than 1 second for generating 1 second video clips on average. We conduct a series of preliminary explorations to find out the optimal tradeoff between computational cost and video quality during diffusion step distillation and hope this could be a good foundation model for open-source explorations. The code and the model weights are available at https://github.com/DA-Group-PKU/Magic-1-For-1.

Computer Aided Design (CAD) is indispensable across various industries. Text-based CAD editing, which automates the modification of CAD models based on textual instructions, holds great potential but remains underexplored. Existing methods primarily focus on design variation generation or text-based CAD generation, either lacking support for text-based control or neglecting existing CAD models as constraints. We introduce CAD-Editor, the first framework for text-based CAD editing. To address the challenge of demanding triplet data with accurate correspondence for training, we propose an automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline utilizes design variation models to generate pairs of original and edited CAD models and employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to summarize their differences into editing instructions. To tackle the composite nature of text-based CAD editing, we propose a locate-then-infill framework that decomposes the task into two focused sub-tasks: locating regions requiring modification and infilling these regions with appropriate edits. Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as the backbone for both sub-tasks, leveraging their capabilities in natural language understanding and CAD knowledge. Experiments show that CAD-Editor achieves superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

DiT-based video generation has achieved remarkable results, but research into enhancing existing models remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce a training-free approach to enhance the coherence and quality of DiT-based generated videos, named Enhance-A-Video. The core idea is enhancing the cross-frame correlations based on non-diagonal temporal attention distributions. Thanks to its simple design, our approach can be easily applied to most DiT-based video generation frameworks without any retraining or fine-tuning. Across various DiT-based video generation models, our approach demonstrates promising improvements in both temporal consistency and visual quality.

Teaching large language models (LLMs) to critique and refine their outputs is crucial for building systems that can iteratively improve, yet it is fundamentally limited by the ability to provide accurate judgments and actionable suggestions. In this work, we study LLM critics for code generation and propose CTRL, a framework for Critic Training via Reinforcement Learning, which trains a critic model to generate feedback that maximizes correction performance for a fixed generator model without human supervision. Our results demonstrate that critics trained with CTRL significantly enhance pass rates and mitigate compounding errors across both base and stronger generator models. Furthermore, we show that these critic models act as accurate generative reward models and enable test-time scaling through iterative critique-revision, achieving up to 106.1% relative improvements across challenging code generation benchmarks.

Large language models (LLMs) often appear to excel on public benchmarks, but these high scores may mask an overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. We introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework that systematically distorts benchmark prompts via a parametric transformation and detects overfitting of LLMs. By rephrasing inputs while preserving their semantic content and labels, C-BOD exposes whether a model's performance is driven by memorized patterns. Evaluated on the MMLU benchmark using 26 leading LLMs, our method reveals an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 out of 26 models exhibiting statistically significant differences. Notably, models with higher baseline accuracy exhibit larger performance differences under perturbation, and larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasings indicating that both cases may overrely on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy show insignificant degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. Moreover, C-BOD's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows easy integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding. Our findings challenge the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.

Recent image-to-video generation methods have demonstrated success in enabling control over one or two visual elements, such as camera trajectory or object motion. However, these methods are unable to offer control over multiple visual elements due to limitations in data and network efficacy. In this paper, we introduce VidCRAFT3, a novel framework for precise image-to-video generation that enables control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction simultaneously. To better decouple control over each visual element, we propose the Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer, which integrates lighting direction, text, and image in a symmetric way. Since most real-world video datasets lack lighting annotations, we construct a high-quality synthetic video dataset, the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset. This dataset includes lighting direction annotations and objects of diverse appearance, enabling VidCRAFT3 to effectively handle strong light transmission and reflection effects. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training strategy that eliminates the need for training data annotated with multiple visual elements (camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction) simultaneously. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of VidCRAFT3 in producing high-quality video content, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of control granularity and visual coherence. All code and data will be publicly available. Project page: https://sixiaozheng.github.io/VidCRAFT3/.

"Recent image-to-video generation methods have demonstrated success in enabling control over one or two visual elements, such as camera trajectory or object motion. However, these methods are unable to offer control over multiple visual elements due to limitations in data and network efficacy. In this paper, we introduce VidCRAFT3, a novel framework for precise image-to-video generation that enables control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction simultaneously. To better decouple control over each visual element, we propose the Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer, which integrates lighting direction, text, and image in a symmetric way. Since most real-world video datasets lack lighting annotations, we construct a high-quality synthetic video dataset, the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset. This dataset includes lighting direction annotations and objects of diverse appearance, enabling VidCRAFT3 to effectively handle strong light transmission and reflection effects. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training strategy that eliminates the need for training data annotated with multiple visual elements (camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction) simultaneously. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of VidCRAFT3 in producing high-quality video content, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of control granularity and visual coherence. All code and data will be publicly available. Project page: https://sixiaozheng.github.io/VidCRAFT3/."
