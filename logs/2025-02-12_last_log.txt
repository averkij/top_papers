Text:"5 2 0 2 7 ] . [ 1 4 6 3 5 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Hypencoder: Hypernetworks for Information Retrieval Julian Killingback jkillingback@cs.umass.com University of Massachusetts Amherst Amherst, MA, USA Hansi Zeng hzeng@cs.umass.edu University of Massachusetts Amherst Amherst, MA, USA Hamed Zamani zamani@cs.umass.edu University of Massachusetts Amherst Amherst, MA, USA ABSTRACT The vast majority of retrieval models depend on vector inner products to produce relevance score between query and document. This naturally limits the expressiveness of the relevance score that can be employed. We propose new paradigm, instead of producing vector to represent the query we produce small neural network which acts as learned relevance function. This small neural network takes in representation of the document, in this paper we use single vector, and produces scalar relevance score. To produce the little neural network we use hypernetwork, network that produce the weights of other networks, as our query encoder or as we call it Hypencoder. Experiments on in-domain search tasks show that Hypencoder is able to significantly outperform strong dense retrieval models and has higher metrics then reranking models and models an order of magnitude larger. Hypencoder is also shown to generalize well to out-of-domain search tasks. To assess the extent of Hypencoders capabilities, we evaluate on set of hard retrieval tasks including tip-of-the-tongue retrieval and instructionfollowing retrieval tasks and find that the performance gap widens substantially compared to standard retrieval tasks. Furthermore, to demonstrate the practicality of our method we implement an approximate search algorithm and show that our model is able to search 8.8M documents in under 60ms. Motivated by this theoretical argument, we introduce new category of retrieval models that can capture complex relationship between query and document representations. Building upon the hypernetwork literature in machine learning [22, 59, 66]"

The vast majority of retrieval models depend on vector inner products to produce a relevance score between a query and a document. This naturally limits the expressiveness of the relevance score that can be employed. We propose a new paradigm, instead of producing a vector to represent the query we produce a small neural network which acts as a learned relevance function. This small neural network takes in a representation of the document, in this paper we use a single vector, and produces a scalar relevance score. To produce the little neural network we use a hypernetwork, a network that produce the weights of other networks, as our query encoder or as we call it a Hypencoder. Experiments on in-domain search tasks show that Hypencoder is able to significantly outperform strong dense retrieval models and has higher metrics then reranking models and models an order of magnitude larger. Hypencoder is also shown to generalize well to out-of-domain search tasks. To assess the extent of Hypencoder's capabilities, we evaluate on a set of hard retrieval tasks including tip-of-the-tongue retrieval and instruction-following retrieval tasks and find that the performance gap widens substantially compared to standard retrieval tasks. Furthermore, to demonstrate the practicality of our method we implement an approximate search algorithm and show that our model is able to search 8.8M documents in under 60ms.
