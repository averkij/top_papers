We detail the practices in building Kimi-Audio, including model architecture, data curation, training recipe, inference deployment, and evaluation.

Kimi-Audio Technical ReportAudio plays an indispensable role in human daily life, such as environment perception, speech conversation, emotion expression, and music appreciation, and is an important topic in artificial general intelligence. Traditional audio modeling, constrained by the development of artificial intelligence, handles each audio processing task (e.g., speech recognition, emotion recognition, sound event detection, and speech conversation) separately. However, audio is naturally sequential and speech has strict correspondence with text, which makes it suitable to take advantage of the rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) in audio modeling. Just as natural language processing has experienced, audio processing evolves quickly from separate models for separate tasks to universal model handling variety of tasks. For example, pioneer works introduce language models in audio generation [3, 77], audio understanding [10, 63, 9], speech recognition [58, 87], speech synthesis [70, 80], and end-to-end speech conversation [29, 14]. However, previous works fall short of building universal audio foundation model for variety of audio processing tasks in several aspects: 1) not universal but only focus on specific type of tasks, such as audio understanding [10, 11, 21, 63, 88, 35], audio generation [45, 77], or speech conversation [14, 84]; 2) not much emphasis on audio pre-training but only fine-tuning an LLM on downstream audio tasks [10, 63, 9]; 3) no access to source codes and checkpoints, with limited value to the community [29, 7]. In this report, we present Kimi-Audio, an open-source audio foundation model that handles variety of audio processing tasks. We detail our effort in building state-of-the-art (SOTA) audio foundation model in three espects: architecture, data, and training. Architecture. Our model consists of three components: an audio tokenizer and detokenizer as audio I/O, and an audio LLM as the core processing part (see Section 2.1). We use discrete semantic audio tokens as the basic representation for both the input and output of the audio LLM. Meanwhile, we concatenate the semantic audio token with continuous acoustic vectors in the input to enhance perception capability, and concatenate with discrete text tokens in the output to enhance the generation capability. In this way, we can achieve good audio perception and generation capabilities at the same time, facilitate universal audio modeling. We reduce the number of token per second in audio to bridge the gap between text and audio sequence and set the compression rate of both the semantic and acoustic audio tokens as 12.5Hz. The detailed design of the audio tokenizer for both discrete semantic tokens and continuous acoustic vectors, as well as the generation of both discrete semantic tokens and text tokens are introduced in Section 2.2 and 2.3 respectively. Data. To achieve SOTA universal audio modeling, we need to pre-train the model on large amount of audio data to see diverse scenarios. To this end, we crawl and process large-scale audio pre-training dataset. We develop data processing pipeline consisting of speech enhancement, diarization, transcription, filtering, etc, to enable high data quality (see Section 3.1). To support diverse audio processing tasks, we curate large amount of task-specific data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We demonstrate an economic way to construct most of SFT data with pure open and accessible data sources and processing tools to achieve SOTA performance, without relying on any data purchase (see Section 3.2). Training. To achieve good audio understanding/generation capability while maintaining high knowledge capacity and intelligence, we initialize the audio LLM with pre-trained LLM, and carefully design series of pre-training tasks to fully learn the audio data and bridge the gap 2 Kimi-Audio Technical Report between text and audio. Specifically, the pre-training tasks can be divided into three categories: 1) text-only and audio-only pre-training, which aims to learn the knowledge from text and audio domains separately; 2) audio-to-text mapping, which encourages the conversion between audio and text; 3) audio-text interleaving, which further bridge the gap between text and audio (see Section 4.1). In the supervised fine-tuning stage, we develop training recipe to improve fine-tuning efficiency and task generalization (see Section 4.2). Furthermore, we introduce the practices for deploying and serving our audio foundation model for inference in Kimi APP, as described in Section 5. Evaluating and benchmarking an audio foundation model in various downstream tasks such as speech recognition, audio understanding, and speech conversation is challenging. We encounter tricky issues in fairly comparing different audio models, such as non-standardized metric, evaluation protocol, and inference hyper-parameters. Therefore, we develop an evaluation toolkit that can faithfully eval"

"We present Kimi-Audio, an open-source audio foundation model that excels in audio understanding, generation, and conversation. We detail the practices in building Kimi-Audio, including model architecture, data curation, training recipe, inference deployment, and evaluation. Specifically, we leverage a 12.5Hz audio tokenizer, design a novel LLM-based architecture with continuous features as input and discrete tokens as output, and develop a chunk-wise streaming detokenizer based on flow matching. We curate a pre-training dataset that consists of more than 13 million hours of audio data covering a wide range of modalities including speech, sound, and music, and build a pipeline to construct high-quality and diverse post-training data. Initialized from a pre-trained LLM, Kimi-Audio is continual pre-trained on both audio and text data with several carefully designed tasks, and then fine-tuned to support a diverse of audio-related tasks. Extensive evaluation shows that Kimi-Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of audio benchmarks including speech recognition, audio understanding, audio question answering, and speech conversation. We release the codes, model checkpoints, as well as the evaluation toolkits in https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Audio."
