Our source code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/zaplm/DC-SAM. Index TermsSegment Anything Model, In-context Segmentation, Prompt Generation, Efficient Parameter TuningRecent visual foundation models such as Segment Anything models (SAM and SAM2) [1], [2] have attracted significant attention in recent years. Leveraging tens of millions of images and videos along with over billion masks, the SAM series demonstrates strong performance in interactive segmentation and proves to be valuable tool across wide range of applications, including medical image segmentation [3], open-vocabulary segmentation [4], [5], and more. In particular, numerous efforts [6], [7], [8] have been made to exploit the versatile segmentation capabilities of SAMs in specific domains, such as reasoning [6], extending the recognition ability, or combining with large language models [9]. Despite the state-of-the-art segmentation capabilities, SAMs lack the inherent ability to segment instances of the same category across multiple images given single instance prompt, an ability we refer to as in-context segmentation inspired by the NLP domain [10], [11]. In this task, the given image and object masks are called support or in-context examples, while the input images are called query images. Previous works explore such abilities with few-shot learning approaches [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], such as calculating the matching distance between query images and support images (known as visual prompts for in-context learning) or modeling object prototypes for better alignment. However, these methods explore in-context learning M. Qi, P. Zhu, X. Bi and H. Ma are with the State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China. X. Li is with Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Lu. Qi and M.-H. Yang are with the UC Merced, US. ability with only few examples and fail to generalize across diverse domains. Most recently, several models [19], [20], [21], [22] based on in-context learning have been developed where the prompts consist of input-output pairs of visual tasks. Specifically, SegGPT [20] explores in-context segmentation by co-training massive image-mask pairs, leading to good generalization ability across various one-shot segmentation benchmarks. Although this work achieves promising performance, substantial computational resources and extensive annotated segmentation data are required to build such system. In contrast, prompt tuning [23], [24], [25] offers an effectively alternative adaptive approach that has shown impressive generalization capabilities across diverse domains. This work proposes an adaptive SAM model for in-context image and video segmentation based on prompt tuning. We note that the existing approaches developed based on SAM [24], [25] mainly depend on the characteristics extracted from the backbone networks and do not fully take advantage of the distinctive properties of the SAM-derived representations, as shown in Figure 1(a). This limitation leads to an oversight of the differences between SAM and backbone network features during the prompt generation process, significantly impacting the accuracy of the generated results. Solely relying on SAM-extracted features for prompt generation often lacks sufficient utilization of the semantic priors of target categories, another critical factor contributing to suboptimal performance. In addition, no suitable benchmarks currently exist to evaluate the in-context segmentation capabilities of video data. Existing benchmarks [26], [27], [28], [29], [30] for video segmentation focus mainly on segmenting and tracking pixels over time. To the best of our knowledge, there are no benchmarks for evaluating this ability using in-context Fig. 1: Overview of the proposed DC-SAM method and IC-VOS benchmark. a) Comparison of the previous few-shot segmentation methods in 1), existing methods based on SAM/SAM2 in 2), and DC-SAM in 3).
