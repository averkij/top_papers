Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them!" Attributed to Albert Einstein For decades, AI research has focused on designing machine learning algorithms that learn from data (Pitts 1943; McCulloch et al. 1948; McCulloch 1949; Samuel 1959) or experience (Sutton et al. 1998; Connell et al. 1999; Silver et al. 2025); often by optimizing an objective (𝜽 ) over parameters 𝜽 Θ with gradient-based methods. While traditional machine learning techniques required careful engineering and domain expertise to design feature extractors, limiting their ability to directly process and learn from natural data (LeCun et al. 2015), deep representation learning offered fully automated alternative to discover the representations needed for the task. Thereafter, deep learning has been an inseparable part of the large-scale computational models with seminal success in chemistry and biology (Jumper et al. 2021), games (Silver et al. 2016, 2018), computer vision (Krizhevsky et al. 2012; Dosovitskiy et al. 2021), and multimodal and natural language understanding (Achiam et al. 2023; Liu et al. 2024a; Comanici et al. 2025). Stacking of multiple layers, as it is done in deep learning models, provides the models with better expressive power in representing complex features, and more internal computations (e.g., #FLOPS) (Montúfar et al. 2014; Poole et al. 2016; Hestness et al. 2017), all of which are critical and desirable characteristics for static tasks that require in-distribution predictions over an a-priori fixed set. This deep design, however, is not universal solution to all the challenges and cannot help the expressive power of the models in multiple aspects, for example: (i) The computational depth of deep models might not change with more layers (Merrill et al. 2022; Sanford et al. 2024), leaving their ability to implement complex algorithms untouched compared to traditional shallow approaches (Merrill et al. 2024); (ii) The capacity of some class of parameters might show marginal improvement with increasing the depth/width of the model (Kaplan et al. 2020); (iii) The training process might converge to suboptimal solution, mainly due to the suboptimal choice of the optimizer Correspondence to: {alibehrouz, razaviyayn, mirrokni}@google.com and peilin.zhong@columbia.edu. version of this work is published at Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025. Figure 1: The uniform and reusable structure as well as multi time scale update in the brain are the key components to unlock the continual learning in humans. Nested Learning (NL) allows for multi time-scale update for each component of the brain, while showing that well-known architectures such as Transformers are in fact linear layers with different frequency updates. or its hyperparameters; and (iv) The models ability to fast adapt to new task, continually learn, and/or generalize to out-of-distribution data might not change with stacking more layers and requires more careful designs. The core part of the efforts to overcome the above challenges and to enhance the capability of deep learning models concentrate on: (1) developing more expressive class of parameters (i.e., neural architectures) (Fukushima 1980; Schmidhuber et al. 1997; Krizhevsky et al. 2012; Vaswani et al. 2017; Behrouz et al. 2025c); (2) introducing objectives that can better model the tasks (Rumelhart et al. 1986; Kingma et al. 2014b; Hjelm et al. 2019; Goodfellow et al. 2020; Alshammari et al. 2025); (3) designing more efficient/effective optimization algorithms to find better solutions or with more resilience to forgetting (Kingma et al. 2014a; Gupta et al. 2018; Farajtabar et al. 2020; Jordan et al. 2024); and (4) scaling the model size to enhance its expressivity, when the right choice of architecture, objective, and optimization algorithms are made (Brown et al. 2020; Kaplan et al. 2020; Hoffmann et al. 2022). Collectively, these advancements and new findings on scaling patterns of deep models have established the foundations upon which Large Language Models (LLMs) have been built.

In this paper, we propose NeoVerse, a versatile 4D world model that is capable of 4D reconstruction, novel-trajectory video generation, and rich downstream applications. We first identify a common limitation of scalability in current 4D world modeling methods, caused either by expensive and specialized multi-view 4D data or by cumbersome training pre-processing. In contrast, our NeoVerse is built upon a core philosophy that makes the full pipeline scalable to diverse in-the-wild monocular videos. Specifically, NeoVerse features pose-free feed-forward 4D reconstruction, online monocular degradation pattern simulation, and other well-aligned techniques. These designs empower NeoVerse with versatility and generalization to various domains. Meanwhile, NeoVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance in standard reconstruction and generation benchmarks.

"In this paper, we propose NeoVerse, a versatile 4D world model that is capable of 4D reconstruction, novel-trajectory video generation, and rich downstream applications. We first identify a common limitation of scalability in current 4D world modeling methods, caused either by expensive and specialized multi-view 4D data or by cumbersome training pre-processing. In contrast, our NeoVerse is built upon a core philosophy that makes the full pipeline scalable to diverse in-the-wild monocular videos. Specifically, NeoVerse features pose-free feed-forward 4D reconstruction, online monocular degradation pattern simulation, and other well-aligned techniques. These designs empower NeoVerse with versatility and generalization to various domains. Meanwhile, NeoVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance in standard reconstruction and generation benchmarks. Our project page is available at https://neoverse-4d.github.io"

Despite the recent progresses, particularly in developing Language Models, there are fundamental challenges and unanswered questions about how such models can continually learn/memorize, self-improve, and find effective solutions. In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.

3D morphing remains challenging due to the difficulty of generating semantically consistent and temporally smooth deformations, especially across categories. We present MorphAny3D, a training-free framework that leverages Structured Latent (SLAT) representations for high-quality 3D morphing. Our key insight is that intelligently blending source and target SLAT features within the attention mechanisms of 3D generators naturally produces plausible morphing sequences. To this end, we introduce Morphing Cross-Attention (MCA), which fuses source and target information for structural coherence, and Temporal-Fused Self-Attention (TFSA), which enhances temporal consistency by incorporating features from preceding frames. An orientation correction strategy further mitigates the pose ambiguity within the morphing steps. Extensive experiments show that our method generates state-of-the-art morphing sequences, even for challenging cross-category cases. MorphAny3D further supports advanced applications such as decoupled morphing and 3D style transfer, and can be generalized to other SLAT-based generative models.
