Date: December 26, 2025 Code: https://github.com/TencentCloudADP/youtu-agentAs Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve towards general purpose agents, building systems that autonomously solve complex real-world tasks has become central pursuit in AI research. However, the current landscape of agent development is hindered by two primary bottlenecks. High Configuration Costs. Developing robust agent remains labor-intensive process. On one hand, practitioners must select appropriate tools and craft effective prompts, which require significant domain expertise and iterative refinement. On the other hand, implementing custom tools demands substantial engineering effort, including writing Python functions, integrating external APIs, and handling edge cases. This craftsman approach creates high barrier to entry and limits the scalability of agent deployment. Static Capabilities. Once deployed, most existing agents remain static and struggle to adapt to new environments. Improving their performance typically requires one of two approaches: (1) manual optimization of prompts or few-shot examples, which is costly and offers no guarantee of improvement; or (2) Supervised *Full author list in contributions. 1 Youtu-Agent Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL), which face substantial challenges including data scarcity, high computational costs, and training instability issues such as entropy explosion in long-horizon tasks. To overcome these challenges, we present Youtu-Agent, comprehensive framework that bridges the gap between automated construction and continuous optimization. To address high configuration costs, Youtu-Agent adopts layered, modular architecture that decouples Environment (execution context), Toolkits (atomic operations), and Agent (LLM-driven planning) into standardized components. This design enables YAML-based structured configuration system that facilitates component reuse and serves as the foundation for automated generation. Building on this architecture, we provide two generation paradigms: the Workflow mode offers deterministic pipeline for routine tasks, while the Meta-Agent mode deploys higher-level architect agent to handle complex, dynamic requirements. To address static capabilities, Youtu-Agent establishes hybrid policy optimization system. For low-cost scenarios where manual prompt optimization proves unreliable, we introduce the Agent Practice module, which enables agents to accumulate experience and self-evolve during runtime. By performing parallel rollouts on dozens of samples and leveraging group relative experiential knowledge optimization, the agent builds contextual memory that enhances future performance without gradient updates. For scenarios demanding significant and lasting performance improvement, the Agent RL module integrates with existing RL training frameworks and bridging protocols to provide an end-to-end reinforcement learning recipe. To ensure both stability and scalability during RL, our module tackles the concurrency bottleneck and entropy explosion/collapsing challenges respectively from the infrastructure and algorithm implementations. Our contributions are as follows: Framework Efficiency. Built entirely on open-source models and tools, Youtu-Agent achieves 71.47% pass@1 on WebWalkerQA and 72.8% pass@1 on GAIA (text-only subset), establishing strong opensource baseline and validating the frameworks general applicability. Automated Agent Generation. Through our two-paradigm generation mechanism, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to automatically generate tools and agent configurations, significantly reducing the burden of manual configuration. The automated tool synthesis achieves over 81% success rate. Continuous Experience Learning. Through the Agent Practice module, we enable low-cost continuous evolution of agents via in-context experience accumulation. This approach yields +2.7% and +5.4% absolute improvements for DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus on AIME 2024 and AIME 2025, respectively. Scalable and Stable Agent RL. Through the Agent RL module, we address the scalability and stability challenges in large-scale reinforcement learning training. Our optimizations achieve 40% speedup in training iteration time and improve Qwen2.5-7B accuracy on AIME 2024 from 10% to 45%, demonstrating the frameworks potential for building evolvable agents.Youtu-Agent is designed with modularity and automation at its core.

While this mechanism effectively mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, it imposes strictly additive inductive bias on feature transformations, thereby limiting the networks capacity to model complex state transitions. In this paper, we introduce Deep Delta Learning (DDL), novel architecture that generalizes the standard residual connection by modulating the identity shortcut with learnable, data-dependent geometric transformation. This transformation, termed the Delta Operator, constitutes rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by reflection direction vector k(X) and gating scalar β(X). We provide spectral analysis of this operator, demonstrating that the gate β(X) enables dynamic interpolation between identity mapping, orthogonal projection, and geometric reflection. Furthermore, we restructure the residual update as synchronous rank-1 injection, where the gate acts as dynamic step size governing both the erasure of old information and the writing of new features. This unification empowers the network to explicitly control the spectrum of its layer-wise transition operator, enabling the modeling of complex, non-monotonic dynamics while preserving the stable training characteristics of gated residual architectures. Project Page: https://github.com/yifanzhang-pro/deep-delta-learning Deep residual networks (He et al., 2016) represent paradigm shift in neural network design, enabling the stable training of models with unprecedented depth. Their core mechanism, the identity shortcut connection, reformulates layers to learn residual function F(X) with respect to their input X. In its canonical form, the residual update is an element-wise addition"

While Softmax attention offers unbounded storage at prohibitive quadratic costs, linear variants provide efficiency but suffer from limited, fixed-size storage. We propose Fast-weight Product Key Memory (FwPKM), novel architecture that resolves this tension by transforming the sparse Product Key Memory (PKM) from static module into dynamic, fast-weight episodic memory. Unlike PKM, FwPKM updates its parameters dynamically at both training and inference time via local chunk-level gradient descent, allowing the model to rapidly memorize and retrieve new key-value pairs from input sequences. Experiments reveal that FwPKM functions as an effective episodic memory that complements the semantic memory of standard modules, yielding significant perplexity reductions on long-context datasets. Notably, in Needle in Haystack evaluations, FwPKM generalizes to 128K-token contexts despite being trained on only 4K-token sequences. 1 Introduction 2 Product Key Memory 3 Fast-weight Product Key Memory 4 Experiments 5 Interpretability Analyses 6 Cost Analyses 7 Related Work 8 Conclusion Detailed Training Settings Ablation Study More Visualization Examples Corresponding author(s): Tianyu Zhao (tianyu@sakana.ai) 2 2 4 9 11 15 16 22 23 24 Fast-weight Product Key Memory 1.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve complex tasks through agentic reasoning, their capabilities remain largely constrained to text-oriented chain-of-thought or isolated tool invocation. They fail to exhibit the human-like proficiency required to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning, particularly in knowledge-intensive and visually complex scenarios that demand coordinated external tools such as search and image cropping. In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, SenseNova-MARS dynamically integrates the image search, text search, and image crop tools to tackle fine-grained and knowledge-intensive visual understanding challenges. In the RL stage, we propose the Batch-Normalized Group Sequence Policy Optimization (BN-GSPO) algorithm to improve the training stability and advance the model's ability to invoke tools and reason effectively. To comprehensively evaluate the agentic VLMs on complex visual tasks, we introduce the HR-MMSearch benchmark, the first search-oriented benchmark composed of high-resolution images with knowledge-intensive and search-driven questions. Experiments demonstrate that SenseNova-MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-source search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks. Specifically, on search-oriented benchmarks, SenseNova-MARS-8B scores 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch, surpassing proprietary models such as Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5. SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs by providing effective and robust tool-use capabilities. To facilitate further research in this field, we will release all code, models, and datasets.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise ell_1 advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.

The efficacy of deep residual networks is fundamentally predicated on the identity shortcut connection. While this mechanism effectively mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, it imposes a strictly additive inductive bias on feature transformations, thereby limiting the network's capacity to model complex state transitions. In this paper, we introduce Deep Delta Learning (DDL), a novel architecture that generalizes the standard residual connection by modulating the identity shortcut with a learnable, data-dependent geometric transformation. This transformation, termed the Delta Operator, constitutes a rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by a reflection direction vector k(X) and a gating scalar β(X). We provide a spectral analysis of this operator, demonstrating that the gate β(X) enables dynamic interpolation between identity mapping, orthogonal projection, and geometric reflection. Furthermore, we restructure the residual update as a synchronous rank-1 injection, where the gate acts as a dynamic step size governing both the erasure of old information and the writing of new features. This unification empowers the network to explicitly control the spectrum of its layer-wise transition operator, enabling the modeling of complex, non-monotonic dynamics while preserving the stable training characteristics of gated residual architectures.

A framework called Avatar Forcing uses diffusion forcing and direct preference optimization with synthetic losing samples to enable real-time, expressive multimodal interactions in talking head avatars without labeled data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Talking head generation creates lifelike avatars from static portraits for virtual communication and content creation. However, current models do not yet convey the feeling of truly interactive communication, often generating one-way responses that lack emotional engagement. We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables real-time interaction with low latency (approximately 500ms), achieving 6.8X speedup compared to the baseline, and produces reactive and expressive avatar motion, which is preferred over 80% against the baseline.

FwPKM introduces a dynamic, fast-weight episodic memory mechanism for sequence modeling that balances storage capacity and efficiency, achieving strong performance on long-context tasks like Needle in a Haystack evaluations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Sequence modeling layers in modern language models typically face a trade-off between storage capacity and computational efficiency. While Softmax attention offers unbounded storage at prohibitive quadratic costs, linear variants provide efficiency but suffer from limited, fixed-size storage. We propose Fast-weight Product Key Memory (FwPKM), a novel architecture that resolves this tension by transforming the sparse Product Key Memory (PKM) from a static module into a dynamic, "fast-weight" episodic memory. Unlike PKM, FwPKM updates its parameters dynamically at both training and inference time via local chunk-level gradient descent, allowing the model to rapidly memorize and retrieve new key-value pairs from input sequences. Experiments reveal that FwPKM functions as an effective episodic memory that complements the semantic memory of standard modules, yielding significant perplexity reductions on long-context datasets. Notably, in Needle in a Haystack evaluations, FwPKM generalizes to 128K-token contexts despite being trained on only 4K-token sequences.

Unlike PKM, FwPKM updates its parameters dynamically at both training and inference time via local chunk-level gradient descent, allowing the model to rapidly memorize and retrieve new key-value pairs from input sequences. Experiments reveal that FwPKM functions as an effective episodic memory that complements the semantic memory of standard modules, yielding significant perplexity reductions on long-context datasets. Notably, in Needle in a Haystack evaluations, FwPKM generalizes to 128K-token contexts despite being trained on only 4K-token sequences."
