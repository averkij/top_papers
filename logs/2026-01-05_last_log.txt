Text:"The ReasoningCreativity Trade-off: Toward Creativity-Driven Problem Solving6 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 7 4 7 0 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r alarge reasoning paths, State-of-the-art language model (LLM) pipelines rely on bootstrapped reasoning loopssampling diverse chains of thought and reinforcing the highest-scoring onesmainly optimizing correctness. We analyze how this design choice is sensitive to the collapse of the models distribution over slashing semantic entropy and undermining creative problemsolving. To analyze this failure, we introduce Distributional Creative Reasoning (DCR), unified variational objective that casts training as gradient flow through probability measures on solution traces. STaR, GRPO, and DPO, as well as entropy bonuses, and other methods, all constitute special cases of the same loss. The framework delivers three core results: (i) the diversity decay theorem, describing how correctness-based objectives lead to distinct modes of diversity decay for STaR, GRPO, and DPO; (ii) designs that ensure convergence to stable and diverse policy, effectively preventing collapse; and (iii) simple, actionable recipes to achieve this in practice. DCR thus offers the first principled recipe for LLMs that remain both correct and creative.Diversity collapse in modern training loops. canonical post-training pipeline for training reasoning LLMs includes two main stages: after supervised fine-tuning, the focus shifts to reinforcement learning (RL), which rewards the highest-scoring traces, typically based on correctness. recurring and detrimental side-effect of this process is creative collapse: the models output entropy plummets, resulting in distribution dominated by handful of semantic templates (Mohammadi, 2024). Creative collapse has been extensively reported across RL from human feedback (RLHF) stages (Kirk et al., 2024), when applying GRPO for mathematical reasoning (Shao et al., 2024), and during self-consistency tuning (Wang et al., 2023). In this paper, we examine why this collapse occurs and whether we can apply design choices that prevent it without sacrificing accuracy. Why diversity matters: Creativity as diverse portfolio for generalization. Especially for tasks outside the training distribution (OOD), creativity in problem-solving is not just nice-to-have but rather core requirement for high performance. single reasoning template will inevitably fail when under novel conditions. We therefore frame creativity as the ability to maintain diverse portfolio of high-utility reasoning strategies. This portfolio promotes OOD generalization, robust planning, and genuine discovery (Stanley and Lehman, 2020). The central question. Our work addresses the following question: Can we design framework that: 1. explains why diversity collapse occurs, 2. predicts the specific mode of collapse for different algorithms, and 3. provides provably effective designs that guarantee diverse portfolio of reasoning paths? Existing literature provides incomplete answers. KL penalties preserve diversity by constraining the policys proximity to base model, limiting drift at the cost of indiscriminately penalizing diverse, high-utility distant parameterizations. Sampling-based methods like Boltzmann sampling or top-k decoding also increase diversity at the cost of quality, and, more critically, they cannot recover strategies whose probabilities have vanished during training. The ReasoningCreativity Trade-off Our answer: Distributional Creative Reasoning. Our primary contribution is theoretical: we provide unified framework to analyze diversity decay and provably sufficient remedy. Since our object of study is not an individual trace, we analyze the dynamics of the entire conditional distribution pθ(π x) over the space of solution traces. By modeling training as gradient flow on this probability simplex, we develop framework, Distributional Creative Reasoning (DCR), to analyze diversity decay and uncover its various sources. The DCR objective is core component of this framework and encompasses multiple terms for utility, regularization, and crucial, strictly concave diversity energy: J(p) = U[p] + λD[p] βKL KL(cid:0)ppbase (cid:1). In particular, the diversity energy D[p] is composite functional with two distinct roles: D[p] = αH[p] βQ[p]. In this equation, αH[p], the Shannon entropy, promotes undiscriminated breadth, while βQ[p] is kernel coverage term that penalizes concentration on semantically similar traces, thereby promoting conceptual distinctiveness. This objective can recover various existing algorithms as specific instantiations, including STaR (Zelikman et al., 2022), GRPO (Shao et al., 2024), and DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023). DCR leads to three core theoretical insights: First, it leads to the Diversity Decay Theorem, which predicts distinct modes of collapse under scalar-only objectives for the most well-known reasoning algorithms: (i) winner-takes-all fixation for STaR, (ii) neutral drift for GRPO, and (iii) homogenization of correct strategies for DPO. Second, we prove that incorporating the DCR diversity energy fundamentally can alter the learning dynamics, guaranteeing convergence to unique, stable, and diverse interior equilibrium that neutralizes these collapse modes. Third, DCR provides set of design levers, the specific creativity kernel k(π, π) and the coefficients α and β. We analyze the effects of their choices, resulting in recipe for training models that are both correct and creative. Contributions. 1. Unified Dynamical Lens. We introduce variational framework based on Shahshahani gradient flow that encompasses STaR, GRPO, and DPO. Within this framework, we derive their diversity decay dynamics under scalar objectives and finitebatch noise. We also provide recipe for adapting the framework to new reward designs. 2. Remedy for Collapse. We prove that the DCR objective, with the diversity energy functional D[p] = αH[p] βQ[p] guarantees convergence to high utility and (under an appropriate design) diverse policy, preventing creative collapse. 3. Principled Design Space and Practical Recipes. We detail how to design the creativity kernel and provide guidance on tuning DCRs hyperparameters. We hope this will transform diversity preservation from ad-hoc heuristics to principled design process. Road-map. Section 2 discusses the literature on diversity collapse and related theoretical frameworks. Section 3 formally defines the DCR objective and its associated gradient flow dynamics. Section 4"

"Large language model training methods that optimize for correctness can cause reasoning path diversity collapse, but a new variational framework provides principled solutions to maintain both accuracy and creativity.  					AI-generated summary 				 State-of-the-art large language model (LLM) pipelines rely on bootstrapped reasoning loops: sampling diverse chains of thought and reinforcing the highest-scoring ones, mainly optimizing correctness. We analyze how this design choice is sensitive to the collapse of the model's distribution over reasoning paths, slashing semantic entropy and undermining creative problem-solving. To analyze this failure, we introduce Distributional Creative Reasoning (DCR), a unified variational objective that casts training as gradient flow through probability measures on solution traces. STaR, GRPO, and DPO, as well as entropy bonuses, and other methods, all constitute special cases of the same loss. The framework delivers three core results: (i) the diversity decay theorem, describing how correctness-based objectives lead to distinct modes of diversity decay for STaR, GRPO, and DPO; (ii) designs that ensure convergence to a stable and diverse policy, effectively preventing collapse; and (iii) simple, actionable recipes to achieve this in practice. DCR thus offers the first principled recipe for LLMs that remain both correct and creative."
