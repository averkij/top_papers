INTRODUCTION In recent years, supervised learning techniques have undergone significant advancements with sufficient high-quality labeled samples [1][4]. In practice, however, it is often prohibitive to collect abundant high-quality labeled samples due to concerns about privacy, confidentiality, copyright, etc. To mitigate this challenge, domain adaptation (DA) methods Yuan Yao is with the Beijing Teleinfo Technology Company Ltd., China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, Beijing 100095, China.

(e-mail: qyang@cse.ust.hk) Corresponding authors: Yu Zhang and Jian Jin. Fig. 1. Example scenario of SHDA with textual source domain and visual target domain. Here, all texts are labeled, but most images remain unlabeled, with only small number having labels. Also, there is no one-toone relationship between texts and images. We do not know what knowledge is transferred across heterogeneous domains. [5][8] have been proposed to improve the learning performance in label-insufficient target domain by drawing upon knowledge from related label-sufficient source domain. Those methods have achieved remarkable progress in various practical applications [9][14]. In general, most existing DA methods [15][21] assume that the original feature representation of source samples is identical to that of target ones. Accordingly, they cannot be directly utilized to handle the heterogeneous scenarios, where source and target samples are characterized by distinct feature representations. However, those heterogeneous scenarios are common in many practical applications [22], [23], such as cross-modal image recognition [24], [25] and cross-lingual text categorization [26][28]. To tackle those scenarios, researchers have formulated an important but challenging problem, i.e., semi-supervised heterogeneous domain adaptation (SHDA) [22], [23]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, under the SHDA setting, source and target samples originate from different feature spaces, such as text and image. Also, source samples are labeled, while the target domain has limited labeled samples and substantial amount of unlabeled ones. In addition, there is no one-toone correspondence, i.e., pair information, between source and target samples. Numerous SHDA methods have been developed [24], [25], [28][30], resulting in improved transfer performance across heterogeneous domains. Since samples from the two domains could be very dissimilar due to the heterogeneous feature spaces, we pose question: What is the transferable knowledge in SHDA? This is an essential issue of SHDA, and however, it has not been well-explored. To explore the above problem in depth, we perform comprewhich has the potential to inspire more intriguing research. Our observations indicate that the essence of transferable knowledge in SHDA primarily lies in the transferability and discriminability of the source domain, regardless of its origin (e.g., image, text, and noise). We open-source the codes and datasets used in this paper at https://github.com/yyyaoyuan/SHDA, including seven typical SHDA methods and several popular datasets, which, to our humble knowledge, is the first relatively comprehensive SHDA open-source repository. The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows. In Section II, we first provide an overview of SHDA. Then, Section III offers the detailed experimental setups. Next, we perform extensive experiments in Sections IV-VI to explore the transferable knowledge in SHDA. Subsequently, in Section VII, we present several insightful discussions. Finally, we make conclusions in Section VIII. II. OVERVIEW In this section, we begin by defining SHDA, followed by concise review. Finally, we summarize the pipeline of SHDA. TABLE NOTATIONS.

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently gained attention due to their distinctive performance and broad applicability. While it has been previously shown that their efficacy in usage scenarios involving non-Western contexts falls short, existing studies are limited in scope, covering just a narrow range of cultures, focusing exclusively on a small number of cultural aspects, or evaluating a limited selection of models on a single task only. Towards globally inclusive LVLM research, we introduce GIMMICK, an extensive multimodal benchmark designed to assess a broad spectrum of cultural knowledge across 144 countries representing six global macro-regions. GIMMICK comprises six tasks built upon three new datasets that span 728 unique cultural events or facets on which we evaluated 20 LVLMs and 11 LLMs, including five proprietary and 26 open-weight models of all sizes. We systematically examine (1) regional cultural biases, (2) the influence of model size, (3) input modalities, and (4) external cues. Our analyses reveal strong biases toward Western cultures across models and tasks and highlight strong correlations between model size and performance, as well as the effectiveness of multimodal input and external geographic cues. We further find that models have more knowledge of tangible than intangible aspects (e.g., food vs. rituals) and that they excel in recognizing broad cultural origins but struggle with a more nuanced understanding.

Semi-supervised heterogeneous domain adaptation (SHDA) addresses learning across domains with distinct feature representations and distributions, where source samples are labeled while most target samples are unlabeled, with only a small fraction labeled. Moreover, there is no one-to-one correspondence between source and target samples. Although various SHDA methods have been developed to tackle this problem, the nature of the knowledge transferred across heterogeneous domains remains unclear. This paper delves into this question from an empirical perspective. We conduct extensive experiments on about 330 SHDA tasks, employing two supervised learning methods and seven representative SHDA methods. Surprisingly, our observations indicate that both the category and feature information of source samples do not significantly impact the performance of the target domain. Additionally, noise drawn from simple distributions, when used as source samples, may contain transferable knowledge. Based on this insight, we perform a series of experiments to uncover the underlying principles of transferable knowledge in SHDA. Specifically, we design a unified Knowledge Transfer Framework (KTF) for SHDA. Based on the KTF, we find that the transferable knowledge in SHDA primarily stems from the transferability and discriminability of the source domain. Consequently, ensuring those properties in source samples, regardless of their origin (e.g., image, text, noise), can enhance the effectiveness of knowledge transfer in SHDA tasks. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/yyyaoyuan/SHDA.
