Text:"ActionPiece: Contextually Tokenizing Action Sequences for Generative Recommendation Yupeng Hou 1 * Jianmo Ni 2 Zhankui He 2 Noveen Sachdeva 2 Wang-Cheng Kang 2 Ed H. Chi 2 Julian McAuley 1 Derek Zhiyuan ChengGenerative recommendation (GR) is an emerging paradigm where user actions are tokenized into discrete token patterns and autoregressively generated as predictions. However, existing GR models tokenize each action independently, assigning the same fixed tokens to identical actions across all sequences without considering contextual relationships. This lack of context-awareness can lead to suboptimal performance, as the same action may hold different meanings depending on its surrounding context. To address this issue, we propose ActionPiece to explicitly incorporate context when tokenizing action sequences. In ActionPiece, each action is represented as set of item features, which serve as the initial tokens. Given the action sequence corpora, we construct the vocabulary by merging feature patterns as new tokens, based on their co-occurrence frequency both within individual sets and across adjacent sets. Considering the unordered nature of feature sets, we further introduce set permutation regularization, which produces multiple segmentations of action sequences with the same semantics. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that ActionPiece consistently outperforms existing action tokenization methods, improving NDCG@10 by 6.00% to 12.82%. 5 2 0 2 9 1 ] .

Introduction Generative recommendation (GR) (Geng et al., 2022; Rajput et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2024a; Zhai et al., 2024) is an emerging paradigm for the sequential recommendation task (Hidasi et al., 2016; Kang & McAuley, 2018). By tokenizing the user actions (typically represented by the interacted items) into discrete tokens, GR models learn to *Work done as student researcher at Google DeepMind. 1University of California, San Diego 2Google DeepMind. Correspondence to: Yupeng Hou <yphou@ucsd.edu>. Figure 1. Illustration of the tokenization process of ActionPiece. Each action is represented as an unordered feature set. This figure presents two possible tokenized sequences. The same action can be tokenized into different tokens depending on the surrounding context. detailed case study can be found in Section 4.5. autoregressively generate tokens, which are then parsed into recommended items. These tokens share compact vocabulary that does not scale with the item pool size, improving model scalability, memory efficiency, and recommendation performance (Rajput et al., 2023; Zhai et al., 2024). The input action sequence is vital in understanding user intentions (Li et al., 2017; Kang & McAuley, 2018), which organizes users historical interactions in chronological order. The same action (e.g., purchasing the same item) may have different meanings in different action sequences. Evidence of taking certain action can be found in the context, such as whether other items in the sequence share the same brand, color tone, or price range (Zhang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2020; Hou et al., 2022; 2023; Yuan et al., 2023). Despite the importance of contextual relations among actions, existing methods tokenize each action independently of its context (summarized in Table 1). The typical pipeline for tokenizing action sequences involves two steps: (1) Tokenizing each action/item individually into pattern of tokens; (2) Replacing each action in the input sequence with its corresponding token pattern. In this way, the tokens do not explicitly contain the context. Instead, they solely rely on the autoregressive models parameters being well-trained to generalize effectively in understanding the context, which challenges the capabilities of GR models. As comparison, tokenization in language modeling also originates from context-independent methods, such as word-level tokeniza1 ActionPiece: Contextually Tokenizing Action Sequences for Generative Recommendation tion (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). decade of progress has led to most tokenization methods for modern large language models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2022; Anil et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023) adopting context-aware approaches, including BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016) and Unigram tokenization (Kudo, 2018), which tokenize the same characters along with their adjacent context into different tokens. In this work, we aim to make the first step towards contextaware tokenization for modeling action sequences. In analogy to how characters or bytes serve as the basic units in language modeling, we consider the associated features of an item as initial tokens. The idea is to iteratively find the most commonly co-occurring pairs of tokens among the training action sequences, then merge them into new tokens to represent segments of context. However, its non-trivial to achieve this. Unlike text, where characters naturally form sequence, the features associated with an action form an unordered set (Zhang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2020). Thus, the proposed tokenization algorithm should be applied on sequences of token sets. We need to carefully consider which pairs of tokens should be counted, whether within single set or between two adjacent sets, and how much weight should be given to these different types of relationships. To this end, we propose ActionPiece, which enables the same actions to be tokenized into different tokens based on their surrounding context. (1) Vocabulary construction: We first initialize the vocabulary to include every unique feature as initial tokens. The vocabulary is then constructed by iteratively learning merge rules. Each merge rule specifies that pair of tokens can be merged into new token. In each iteration, we enumerate the training corpus to count the co-occurrence of existing tokens. Considering the structural differences between token pairs, e.g., whether they occur within single set or between two adjacent sets, we assign different weights to different pairs during the counting process. (2) Segmentation: The next step is to segment action sequences into token sequences for GR model training and inference. To fully exploit the unordered nature of the feature set for each action, we introduce set permutation regularization. By randomly permuting the features within each set, we can produce multiple token sequences of single action sequence that preserve the same semantics. These variations act as nat"

Generative recommendation (GR) is an emerging paradigm where user actions are tokenized into discrete token patterns and autoregressively generated as predictions. However, existing GR models tokenize each action independently, assigning the same fixed tokens to identical actions across all sequences without considering contextual relationships. This lack of context-awareness can lead to suboptimal performance, as the same action may hold different meanings depending on its surrounding context. To address this issue, we propose ActionPiece to explicitly incorporate context when tokenizing action sequences. In ActionPiece, each action is represented as a set of item features, which serve as the initial tokens. Given the action sequence corpora, we construct the vocabulary by merging feature patterns as new tokens, based on their co-occurrence frequency both within individual sets and across adjacent sets. Considering the unordered nature of feature sets, we further introduce set permutation regularization, which produces multiple segmentations of action sequences with the same semantics. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that ActionPiece consistently outperforms existing action tokenization methods, improving NDCG@10 by 6.00% to 12.82%.

We introduce Qwen2.5-VL, the latest flagship model of Qwen vision-language series, which demonstrates significant advancements in both foundational capabilities and innovative functionalities. Qwen2.5-VL achieves a major leap forward in understanding and interacting with the world through enhanced visual recognition, precise object localization, robust document parsing, and long-video comprehension. A standout feature of Qwen2.5-VL is its ability to localize objects using bounding boxes or points accurately. It provides robust structured data extraction from invoices, forms, and tables, as well as detailed analysis of charts, diagrams, and layouts. To handle complex inputs, Qwen2.5-VL introduces dynamic resolution processing and absolute time encoding, enabling it to process images of varying sizes and videos of extended durations (up to hours) with second-level event localization. This allows the model to natively perceive spatial scales and temporal dynamics without relying on traditional normalization techniques. By training a native dynamic-resolution Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch and incorporating Window Attention, we reduce computational overhead while maintaining native resolution. As a result, Qwen2.5-VL excels not only in static image and document understanding but also as an interactive visual agent capable of reasoning, tool usage, and task execution in real-world scenarios such as operating computers and mobile devices. Qwen2.5-VL is available in three sizes, addressing diverse use cases from edge AI to high-performance computing. The flagship Qwen2.5-VL-72B model matches state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, particularly excelling in document and diagram understanding. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL maintains robust linguistic performance, preserving the core language competencies of the Qwen2.5 LLM.
