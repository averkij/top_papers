Text:"High-Fidelity Novel View Synthesis via Splatting-Guided Diffusion XIANG ZHANG, ETH Zürich, Switzerland and DisneyResearchStudios, Switzerland YANG ZHANG, DisneyResearchStudios, Switzerland LUKAS MEHL, DisneyResearchStudios, Switzerland MARKUS GROSS, ETH Zürich, Switzerland and DisneyResearchStudios, Switzerland CHRISTOPHER SCHROERS, DisneyResearchStudios, Switzerland 5 2 0 2 8 1 ] . [ 1 2 5 7 2 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r Fig. 1. Performance comparison. Diffusion-based methods, e.g., ViewCrafter, usually hallucinate contents that are inconsistent with the input view. Splatting-based approaches, e.g., DepthSplat, often suffer from distorted geometry due to splatting errors. By contrast, our method produces novel views with consistent geometry and high-fidelity texture, achieving significantly better performance than previous arts on different tasks. Note that our model is trained only on the single-view novel view synthesis and is directly applied to the other tasks, showing promising cross-domain and cross-task performance. Despite recent advances in Novel View Synthesis (NVS), generating highfidelity views from single or sparse observations remains significant challenge. Existing splatting-based approaches often produce distorted geometry due to splatting errors. While diffusion-based methods leverage rich 3D priors to achieve improved geometry, they often suffer from texture hallucination. In this paper, we introduce SplatDiff, pixel-splatting-guided video diffusion model designed to synthesize high-fidelity novel views from single image. Specifically, we propose an aligned synthesis strategy for precise control of target viewpoints and geometry-consistent view synthesis. To mitigate texture hallucination, we design texture bridge module that enables high-fidelity texture generation through adaptive feature fusion. In this manner, SplatDiff leverages the strengths of splatting and diffusion to generate novel views with consistent geometry and high-fidelity details. Extensive "

Despite recent advances in Novel View Synthesis (NVS), generating high-fidelity views from single or sparse observations remains a significant challenge. Existing splatting-based approaches often produce distorted geometry due to splatting errors. While diffusion-based methods leverage rich 3D priors to achieve improved geometry, they often suffer from texture hallucination. In this paper, we introduce SplatDiff, a pixel-splatting-guided video diffusion model designed to synthesize high-fidelity novel views from a single image. Specifically, we propose an aligned synthesis strategy for precise control of target viewpoints and geometry-consistent view synthesis. To mitigate texture hallucination, we design a texture bridge module that enables high-fidelity texture generation through adaptive feature fusion. In this manner, SplatDiff leverages the strengths of splatting and diffusion to generate novel views with consistent geometry and high-fidelity details. Extensive experiments verify the state-of-the-art performance of SplatDiff in single-view NVS. Additionally, without extra training, SplatDiff shows remarkable zero-shot performance across diverse tasks, including sparse-view NVS and stereo video conversion.

We introduce TESS 2, a general instruction-following diffusion language model that outperforms contemporary instruction-tuned diffusion models, as well as matches and sometimes exceeds strong autoregressive (AR) models. We train TESS 2 by first adapting a strong AR model via continued pretraining with the usual cross-entropy as diffusion loss, and then performing further instruction tuning. We find that adaptation training as well as the choice of the base model is crucial for training good instruction-following diffusion models. We further propose reward guidance, a novel and modular inference-time guidance procedure to align model outputs without needing to train the underlying model. Finally, we show that TESS 2 further improves with increased inference-time compute, highlighting the utility of diffusion LMs in having fine-grained controllability over the amount of compute used at inference time. Code and models are available at https://github.com/hamishivi/tess-2.
