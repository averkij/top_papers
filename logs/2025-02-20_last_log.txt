Existing approaches often employ multi-stage generation procedures, resulting in cumbersome training and inference pipelines. In this paper, we propose SongGen, fully open-source, single-stage auto-regressive transformer designed for controllable song generation. The proposed model facilitates fine-grained control over diverse musical attributes, including lyrics and textual descriptions of instrumentation, genre, mood, and timbre, while also offering an optional three-second reference clip for voice cloning. Within unified auto-regressive framework, SongGen supports two output modes: mixed mode, which generates mixture of vocals and accompaniment directly, and dual-track mode, which synthesizes them separately for greater flexibility in downstream applications. We explore diverse token pattern strategies for each mode, leading to notable improvements and valuable insights. Furthermore, we design an automated data preprocessing pipeline with effective quality control. To foster community engagement and future research, we will release our model weights, training code, annotated data, and preprocessing pipeline.

Correspondence to: Jiaqi Wang <wangjiaqi@pjlab.org.cn>. Figure 1. Traditional methods often rely on multi-stage processes, making pipelines inflexible and complex. SongGen simplifies this with single-stage auto-regressive transformer that supports both mixed mode and dual-track mode song generation. 1. Introduction Songs, blending vocals with instrumental accompaniment, are cornerstone of musical expression. Unlike purely instrumental music, songs uniquely capture human emotions through emotive lyrics and diverse melodies. However, creating song is complex, multi-stage process involving composition, instrumental arrangement, vocal performance, and more. This process requires substantial time and expertise, making it challenging for most individuals. With the rise of AI Generated Content (AIGC), creative fields have been revolutionized, extending from text and image generation (Rombach et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023) to sophisticated artistic domains like music (Huang et al., 2019; Dhariwal et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2020). Building on these advancements, text-to-song generative models aim to transform natural language descriptions into full-song audio, making music creation more accessible and efficient. Song generation presents greater complexity than speech or instrumental music generation (Lyth & King, 2024; Chen et al., 2024b; Liu et al., 2024; Copet et al., 2024), and the scarcity of open-source data further limits research in this area. Current approaches (Hong et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024a) tackle this challenge by separating vocals and accompani1 SongGen: Single Stage Auto-regressive Transformer for Text-to-Song Generation ment into distinct tracks, relying on multi-stage generation processes. As illustrated in Figure 1, these models first generate the vocal track from lyrics, then produce the accompaniment using natural language prompts alongside the generated vocals. However, multi-stage generation results in cumbersome training and inference pipelines while lacking unified control over both vocals and accompaniment. To improve pipeline simplicity and control flexibility, an important question arises: Is it possible for single-stage model to achieve effective text-to-song generation? In this paper, we introduce SongGen, fully open-source, single-stage text-to-song generation model based on an autoregressive transformer architecture. SongGen transforms lyrics and descriptive text into songs with harmonized vocals and accompaniment, allowing fine-grained control over instruments, genre, mood, timbre, and other musical elements. With three-second reference vocal clip, it also supports zero-shot voice cloning. These user-defined controls are incorporated through modal-specific encoders, learnable projectors, and cross-attention mechanisms. SongGen offers two flexible generation modes: mixed mode, which blends vocals and accompaniment into single output, and dual-track mode, which synthesizes them separately to facilitate professional post-production editing. However, due to the sophisticated relationship between vocals and accompaniment in song, jointly predicting them with natural expressiveness is non-trivial task. To this end, we perform extensive explorations into output token patterns, yielding valuable insights. Specifically, (1) in mixed mode, while the model generates high-quality accompaniment, it struggles with natural-sounding vocals. Accompaniment, with higher energy and stable spectral distribution, is easier to produce, whereas vocals, with higher semantic density and lower signal-to-noise ratio due to overlap, pose greater challenge. This learning bias makes it difficult to generate vocals with clear lyrics, problem typically addressed by decoupling and multi-stage methods. To mitigate this issue, we introduce an auxiliary vocal token prediction target, enhancing the models focus on vocal features and significantly improving vocal clarity in mixed-token outputs. (2) In dual-track mode, vocals and accompaniment are treated as distinct yet interconnected sequences, generated in sync by single transformer decoder. We explore various track combination patterns to maintain precise frame-level alignment. Experimental results indicate that the optimal pattern yields well-coordinated vocals and accompaniment, achieving quality on par with mixed-mode generation. Moreover, the text-to-song generation community has long been constrained by data scarcity. To the best of our knowledge, no publicly available dataset currently includes paired audio, lyrics, and captions. To bridge this gap, we develop an automated pipeline for data cleanin"

The proposed model facilitates fine-grained control over diverse musical attributes, including lyrics and textual descriptions of instrumentation, genre, mood, and timbre, while also offering an optional three-second reference clip for voice cloning. Within a unified auto-regressive framework, SongGen supports two output modes: mixed mode, which generates a mixture of vocals and accompaniment directly, and dual-track mode, which synthesizes them separately for greater flexibility in downstream applications. We explore diverse token pattern strategies for each mode, leading to notable improvements and valuable insights. Furthermore, we design an automated data preprocessing pipeline with effective quality control. To foster community engagement and future research, we will release our model weights, training code, annotated data, and preprocessing pipeline. The generated samples are showcased on our project page at https://liuzh-19.github.io/SongGen/ , and the code will be available at https://github.com/LiuZH-19/SongGen .

  "desc": "SongGen - это новая модель машинного обучения для генерации песен на основе текстового ввода. Она использует архитектуру трансформера и позволяет контролировать различные музыкальные атрибуты, включая текст песни, инструментовку, жанр и настроение. Модель может работать в двух режимах: смешанном (генерация вокала и аккомпанемента вместе) и двухдорожечном (раздельная генерация). Авторы также разработали автоматизированный конвейер предобработки данных и планируют открыть исходный код и веса модели для дальнейших исследований.",

"Text-to-song generation, the task of creating vocals and accompaniment from textual inputs, poses significant challenges due to domain complexity and data scarcity. Existing approaches often employ multi-stage generation procedures, resulting in cumbersome training and inference pipelines. In this paper, we propose SongGen, a fully open-source, single-stage auto-regressive transformer designed for controllable song generation. The proposed model facilitates fine-grained control over diverse musical attributes, including lyrics and textual descriptions of instrumentation, genre, mood, and timbre, while also offering an optional three-second reference clip for voice cloning.
