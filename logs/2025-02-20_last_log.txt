[ 1 5 6 9 3 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r Autellix: An Efficient Serving Engine for LLM Agents as General Programs Michael Luo1,2 Xiaoxiang Shi3, Colin Cai1, Tianjun Zhang1 Justin Wong1 Yichuan Wang1 Chi Wang2 Yanping Huang2 Zhifeng Chen2 Joseph E. Gonzalez1 Ion Stoica1 1UC Berkeley 2Google DeepMind 3Shanghai Jiao Tong University Abstract Large language model (LLM) applications are evolving beyond simple chatbots into dynamic, general-purpose agentic programs, which scale LLM calls and output tokens to help AI agents reason, explore, and solve complex tasks. However, existing LLM serving systems ignore dependencies between programs and calls, missing significant opportunities for optimization. Our analysis reveals that programs submitted to LLM serving engines experience long cumulative wait times, primarily due to head-of-line blocking at both the individual LLM request and the program. To address this, we introduce Autellix, an LLM serving system that treats programs as first-class citizens to minimize their end-to-end latencies. Autellix intercepts LLM calls submitted by programs, enriching schedulers with programlevel context. We propose two scheduling algorithmsfor single-threaded and distributed programsthat preempt and prioritize LLM calls based on their programs previously completed calls. Our evaluation demonstrates that across diverse LLMs and agentic workloads, Autellix improves throughput of programs by 4-15 at the same latency compared to state-of-the-art systems, such as vLLM. Large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents enhance their problem solving capabilities by scaling their inference computationthat is, increasing the number of output tokens or LLM calls [9,12,22,30,31,65]. With more calls and tokens, LLMs endow agents with improved reasoning [19,76,84, 85], planning and search capabilities [56, 91], self-reflection from prior experiences [34,64,87], and collaboration between multiple agents [20, 78, 95].

Text:"AdaptiveStep: Automatically Dividing Reasoning Step through Model Confidence Yuliang Liu * 1 Junjie Lu * 2 Zhaoling Chen 1 Chaofeng Qu Jason Klein Liu Chonghan Liu Zefan Cai 3 Yunhui Xia Li Zhao 4 Jiang Bian 4 Chuheng Zhang 4 Wei Shen Zhouhan Lin 5 Abstract Current approaches for training Process Reward Models (PRMs) often involve breaking down responses into multiple reasoning steps using rule-based techniques, such as using predefined placeholder tokens or setting the reasoning steps length into fixed size. These approaches overlook the fact that specific words do not typically mark true decision points in text. To address this, we propose AdaptiveStep, method that divides reasoning steps based on the models confidence in predicting the next word. This division method provides more decision-making information at each step, enhancing downstream tasks, such as reward model learning. Moreover, our method does not require manual annotation. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with AdaptiveStep-trained PRMs in mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. Experimental results indicate that the outcome PRM achieves state-of-the-art Best-of-N performance, surpassing greedy search strategy with token-level value-guided decoding, while also reducing construction costs by over 30% compared to existing open-source PRMs. In addition, we provide thorough analysis and case study on the PRMs performance, transferability, and generalization capabilities.

Web crawl is a main source of large language models' (LLMs) pretraining data, but the majority of crawled web pages are discarded in pretraining due to low data quality. This paper presents Crawl4LLM, an efficient web crawling method that explores the web graph based on the preference of LLM pretraining. Specifically, it leverages the influence of a webpage in LLM pretraining as the priority score of the web crawler's scheduler, replacing the standard graph connectivity based priority. Our experiments on a web graph containing 900 million webpages from a commercial search engine's index demonstrate the efficiency of Crawl4LLM in obtaining high-quality pretraining data. With just 21% URLs crawled, LLMs pretrained on Crawl4LLM data reach the same downstream performances of previous crawls, significantly reducing the crawling waste and alleviating the burdens on websites. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/cxcscmu/Crawl4LLM.

"Web crawl is a main source of large language models' (LLMs) pretraining data, but the majority of crawled web pages are discarded in pretraining due to low data quality. This paper presents Crawl4LLM, an efficient web crawling method that explores the web graph based on the preference of LLM pretraining. Specifically, it leverages the influence of a webpage in LLM pretraining as the priority score of the web crawler's scheduler, replacing the standard graph connectivity based priority. Our experiments on a web graph containing 900 million webpages from a commercial search engine's index demonstrate the efficiency of Crawl4LLM in obtaining high-quality pretraining data. With just 21% URLs crawled, LLMs pretrained on Crawl4LLM data reach the same downstream performances of previous crawls, significantly reducing the crawling waste and alleviating the burdens on websites.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in general domains but often struggle with tasks requiring specialized knowledge. Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques typically retrieve external information from static knowledge bases, which can be outdated or incomplete, missing fine-grained clinical details essential for accurate medical question answering. In this work, we propose SearchRAG, a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by leveraging real-time search engines. Our method employs synthetic query generation to convert complex medical questions into search-engine-friendly queries and utilizes uncertainty-based knowledge selection to filter and incorporate the most relevant and informative medical knowledge into the LLM's input. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves response accuracy in medical question answering tasks, particularly for complex questions requiring detailed and up-to-date knowledge.

Current approaches for training Process Reward Models (PRMs) often involve breaking down responses into multiple reasoning steps using rule-based techniques, such as using predefined placeholder tokens or setting the reasoning step's length into a fixed size. These approaches overlook the fact that specific words do not typically mark true decision points in a text. To address this, we propose AdaptiveStep, a method that divides reasoning steps based on the model's confidence in predicting the next word. This division method provides more decision-making information at each step, enhancing downstream tasks, such as reward model learning. Moreover, our method does not require manual annotation. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with AdaptiveStep-trained PRMs in mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. Experimental results indicate that the outcome PRM achieves state-of-the-art Best-of-N performance, surpassing greedy search strategy with token-level value-guided decoding, while also reducing construction costs by over 30% compared to existing open-source PRMs. In addition, we provide a thorough analysis and case study on the PRM's performance, transferability, and generalization capabilities.
