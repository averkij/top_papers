Text:"5 2 0 2 1 2 ] . [ 1 3 9 4 5 1 . 7 0 5 2 : r GR-3 Technical ReportFull Author List in Contributions and AcknowledgementsWe report our recent progress towards building generalist robot policies, the development of GR-3. GR-3 is large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) model. It showcases exceptional capabilities in generalizing to novel objects, environments, and instructions involving abstract concepts. Furthermore, it can be efficiently fine-tuned with minimal human trajectory data, enabling rapid and cost-effective adaptation to new settings. GR-3 also excels in handling long-horizon and dexterous tasks, including those requiring bi-manual manipulation and mobile movement, showcasing robust and reliable performance. These capabilities are achieved through multi-faceted training recipe that includes co-training with web-scale vision-language data, efficient fine-tuning from human trajectory data collected via VR devices, and effective imitation learning with robot trajectory data. In addition, we introduce ByteMini, versatile bi-manual mobile robot designed with exceptional flexibility and reliability, capable of accomplishing wide range of tasks when integrated with GR-3. Through extensive real-world experiments, we show GR-3 surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline method, π0, on wide variety of challenging tasks. We hope GR-3 can serve as step towards building generalist robots capable of assisting humans in daily life. Date: July 22, 2025 Correspondence: wuhongtao.123@bytedance.com Project Page: https://seed.bytedance.com/GRThe pursuit of intelligent generalist robots that are capable of assisting humans with daily tasks has been long-standing goal in robotics research [3, 7, 911, 13, 67]. key challenge stems from the immense diversity of the real world, requiring robot policies to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle wide range of novel scenarios. Additionally, many daily tasks are inherently long-horizon and require complex dexterous manipulation, demanding robot policies to be highly robust and reliable. Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models [9, 11, 29, 37, 67] have paved promising path towards developing intelligent generalist robot policies. These models are built upon pre-trained visionlanguage models (VLMs) [4, 14, 19, 39] and integrate the action prediction capabilities, enabling robots to perform wide range of tasks following natural language instructions. Despite these progresses, instruction following remains significant challenge, especially for out-of-distribution instructions that involve novel object categories that are unseen in robot trajectory data and/or complex concepts that require sophisticated reasoning [11, 49]. Moreover, VLA models typically require large amounts of demonstrations for policy training, posing substantial challenges for efficient adaptation to novel settings. Finally, ensuring robustness in complex long-horizon tasks remains challenging due to accumulative errors, especially for tasks involving dexterous skills, such as manipulating deformable objects. 1 Figure 1 Overview. GR-3 is able to learn from three types of data: vision-language data, robot trajectory data, and human trajectory data. It is able to perform dexterous and long-horizon tasks with exceptional robustness and generalize well to novel objects, environments, and instructions. In this report, we introduce GR-3, large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) model that 1) strictly follows languages and generalizes well to novel objects, environments, and instructions, 2) efficiently learns from few-shot human trajectory data for rapid adaptation to novel settings, and 3) performs long-horizon and dexterous tasks with high robustness and reliability  (Fig. 1)  . GR-3 takes as inputs natural language instruction, observations from the environment, and the robot state. It outputs an action chunk to control bi-manual mobile robot in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, GR-3 is built upon pre-trained VLM [2] and predicts actions via flow-matching [47, 48]. We perform careful studies on model architecture, and introduce set of well-chosen design choices, which we find crucial for instruction following capabilities and long-horizon task performance. To enhance generalization capabilities, we co-train GR-3 on robot trajectory data and large-scale vision-language data covering wide variety of vision-language tasks. This training recipe enables GR-3 to not only handle objects from novel categories, but also understand abstract concepts relating to sizes, spatial relationships, and common-sense knowledge  (Fig. 2)  , which are unseen within the robot trajectory data. Besides, we showcase that GR-3 can be efficiently fine-tuned with minimal human trajectory data collected via VR devices, enabling rapid and cost-effective adaptation to novel settings. Alongside GR-3, we introduce ByteMini, versatile bi-manual mobile robot designed with high flexibility and reliability, capable of accomplishing wide range of challenging tasks in the real world. We perform extensive real-world experiments across three challenging tasks: 1) generalizable pick-and-place, 2) long-horizon table bussing, and 3) dexterous cloth manipulation. GR-3 consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, π0, across all tasks. It showcases strong capabilities in generalizing to objects from novel categories and understanding complex semantics. Moreover, it efficiently adapts to novel objects with only 10 human trajectories per objects. Finally, GR-3 excels in performing long-horizon and dexterous tasks with remarkable robustness, achieving high average task progress in the challenging tasks of table bussing and cloth manipulation. 2 Figure 2 Capabilities. GR-3 strictly follows instructions and is capable of understanding unseen instructions involving abstract concepts. It performs robustly and reliably on long-horizon table bussing and dexterous cloth manipulation. 3 Figure 3 The GR-3 Model. GR-3 is co-trained on both robot trajectories and vision-language data with flow-matching objective (left) and next-token-prediction objective (right), respectively.GR-3 is an end-to-end vision-language-action (VLA) model πθ. It controls bi-manual robot with mobile base by generating k-length action chunk at = at:t+k conditioned on the input language instruction l, observation ot, and robot state st, i.e., at = πθ(l, ot, st). GR-3 adopts the mixture-of-transformers architecture [45]. It processes the "

Prompt: Read an abstract of the ML paper and return a JSON with fields: 'desc': explanation of the paper in Russian (4 sentences), use correct machine learning terms. 'emoji': emoji that will reflect the theme of an article somehow, only one emoji. 'title': a slogan of a main idea of the article in Russian. Return only JSON and nothing else.

Human intelligence requires correctness and robustness, with the former being foundational for the latter. In video understanding, correctness ensures the accurate interpretation of visual content, and robustness maintains consistent performance in challenging conditions. Despite advances in video large language models (video LLMs), existing benchmarks inadequately reflect the gap between these models and human intelligence in maintaining correctness and robustness in video interpretation. We introduce the Video Thinking Test (Video-TT), to assess if video LLMs can interpret real-world videos as effectively as humans. Video-TT reflects genuine gaps in understanding complex visual narratives, and evaluates robustness against natural adversarial questions. Video-TT comprises 1,000 YouTube Shorts videos, each with one open-ended question and four adversarial questions that probe visual and narrative complexity. Our evaluation shows a significant gap between video LLMs and human performance.
