However, their ability to accurately simulate physical phenomena remains critical and unresolved challenge. This paper presents PhyWorldBench, comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion. Adco-advisor 1University of California, Santa Cruz 2NVIDIA Research 3Northeastern University. Correspondence to: Jing Gu <jgu110@ucsc.edu>. ditionally, we introduce novel Anti-Physics category, where prompts intentionally violate realworld physics, enabling the assessment of whether models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency. Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design simple yet effective method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with detailed comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050 curated promptsspanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarioswe identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical 1 and precise, allowing for more thorough assessment of video generation models capabilities. Furthermore, we present context-aware-prompt metric using MLLM (OpenAI Team, 2024; Gemini Team, 2024), which directly assesses if the video satisfies the physics standards or not. Such evaluation not only provided an unbiased metric but also significantly reduced the evaluation cost. To examine the current status of video generation models and provide detailed analysis, we selected five proprietary modelsSora-Turbo (OpenAI, 2024), Gen-3 (Runway Team, 2024), Kling 1.6 (KlingAI, 2024), Pika 2.0 (Pika Labs Team, 2024), and Luma (Luma AI Team, 2024)along with seven open-source models: Hunyuan 720p (Kong et al., 2024), Open-Sora 2.0 (Peng et al., 2025), Open-Sora-Plan 1.3 (Lin et al., 2024), CogVideo 14b (Hong et al., 2022), Step-video-T2V (Ma et al., 2025), Wanx-2.1 (WanTeam et al., 2025), and LTX-Video (HaCohen et al., 2024). We generated 12,600 videos to evaluate SOTA models and analyze their ability to simulate real-world physics. We identify challenges, difficult scenarios, and key physics categories while proposing structured approach to improve physical realism through prompt design. The insights obtained from this benchmark will contribute to the development of more robust and physically accurate video generation models, addressing both fundamental scientific questions and practical challenges in the field. Figure 2 presents the overall benchmark results on PhyWorldBench. Despite recent advancements, models continue to struggle with temporal consistency, realistic motion, and physical plausibility, emphasizing the need for further research to enhance their physics correctness for real-world simulation. Our work provides benchmark for video generation models with focus on physical realism. The key contributions are: We propose PhyWorldBench, large-scale, multidimensional physics benchmark for evaluating the physics ability of the video generation model. We conduct an extensive evaluation of twelve state-of-theart video generation models (five proprietary and seven open-source) with 12,600 generated videos and identified key challenges in simulating real-world physics. We study the effect of prompt variation on the performance of the video generation model and provided prompt guidelines for generating physics-following videos. 2. Related Work Benchmarks for Text-to-Video Generation. Proprietary video generators (OpenAI, 2024; KlingAI, 2024; Pika Labs Team, 2024; Runway Team, 2024; HailuoAI, 2024; Luma AI Team, 2024) achieve striking quality and temporal coherence but remain opaque. Open-source counterparts (Peng Figure 2. Success rates of video generation models on PhyWorldBench. Among open-source models, Wanx demonstrated the highest performance, while Pika achieved the best results among proprietary models with success rate of 0.262. Despite these advancements, substantial progress remains necessary to refine the capability of these models to accurately simulate the intricate dynamics of the real world. phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles. 1. Introduction The field of video generation has made remarkable progress, with models producing visually compelling and often photorealistic outputs. These advances have enabled transformative applications across industries such as entertainment, education, and scientific visualization. However, despite their visual fidelity, do video generation models truly understand the laws of physics in the real world? To answer this question, we introduce PhyWorldBench, rigorous benchmark designed to evaluate how well video generation models can simulate real-world physics. As illustrated in Figure 1, PhyWorldBench systematically tests models across multiple levels of physical phenomena, from fundamental concepts like object motion to complex dynamics, including rigid body interactions and human/animal motion. Additionally, we propose novel Anti-Physics category, where prompts del"

Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating high-quality, photorealistic content. However, their ability to accurately simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion. Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency. Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050 curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.
