Text:"Seedance 1.5 pro: Native Audio-Visual Joint Generation Foundation ModelRecent strides in video generation have paved the way for unified audio-visual generation. In this work, we present Seedance 1.5 pro, foundational model engineered specifically for native, joint audio-video generation. Leveraging dual-branch Diffusion Transformer architecture, the model integrates cross-modal joint module with specialized multi-stage data pipeline, achieving exceptional audio-visual synchronization and superior generation quality. To ensure practical utility, we implement meticulous post-training optimizations, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on high-quality datasets and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with multi-dimensional reward models. Furthermore, we introduce an acceleration framework that boosts inference speed by over 10. Seedance 1.5 pro distinguishes itself through precise multilingual and dialect lip-syncing, dynamic cinematic camera control, and enhanced narrative coherence, positioning it as robust engine for professional-grade content creation. Seedance 1.5 pro is now accessible on Volcano Engineα. Official Page: https://seed.bytedance.com/seedance1_5_pro αModel ID: Doubao-Seedance-1.5-pro 5 2 0 2 6 1 ] . [ 2 7 0 5 3 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r Figure 1 Overall Evaluation. Left: Video Evaluation; Right: Audio Evaluation.Over the past year, the field of visual (video) generation [2, 5, 9, 1113] has seen rapid development. The emergence of proprietary commercial systems, such as Veo, Sora, Kling series and Seedance [3], alongside open-source models like Wan [11] and Hunyuan Video 1.5 [6], has significantly propelled the widespread adoption of video generation technologies across both academia and industry. More recently, substantial progress has been made in joint audio-video generation. The release of Wan 2.5, Kling 2.6, and Sora 2 marks solid step forward, transforming video generation capabilities into practical, utility-driven tools. In this work, we present Seedance 1.5 pro, foundational model designed with native support for joint video-audio generation. It is capable of performing diverse range of tasks, including text-to-audio-video synthesis and image-guided audio-video generation. Seedance 1.5 pro incorporates the following key technical advancements: Comprehensive AudioVisual Data Framework. We present holistic data framework for high-quality videoaudio generation that integrates multi-stage curation pipeline, an advanced captioning system, and scalable infrastructure. The pipeline prioritizes videoaudio coherence, motion expressiveness, and curriculum-based data scheduling, while our captioning system provides rich, professional-grade descriptions for both video and audio modalities. This robust framework is underpinned by an efficient engineering infrastructure optimized for massive multi-modal data processing. Unified Multimodal Joint Generation Architecture. To achieve native videoaudio joint synthesis, we propose unified framework based on the MMDiT [1] architecture. This design facilitates deep crossmodal interaction, ensuring precise temporal synchronization and semantic consistency between visual and auditory streams. By leveraging multi-task pre-training on large-scale mixed-modality datasets, our model achieves robust generalization across diverse downstream tasks, including Text-to-Video-Audio (T2VA), Image-to-Video-Audio (I2VA), and unimodal video generation (T2V, I2V). Meticulous Post-training Optimization. We utilized high-quality audio-video datasets for Supervised FineTuning (SFT), followed by Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF[7, 1416]) algorithm specifically tailored for audio-video contexts. Specifically, our multi-dimensional reward model enhances performance in Text-to-Video (T2V) and Image-to-Video (I2V) tasks, improving motion quality, visual aesthetics, and audio fidelity. Moreover, targeted infrastructure optimizations to our RLHF pipeline have yielded nearly 3 improvement in training speed. Efficient Inference Acceleration. We further optimized multi-stage distillation framework [4, 8, 10] to substantially reduce the Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) required during generation. By integrating inference infrastructure optimizationssuch as quantization and parallelism, we achieved an end-to-end acceleration exceeding 10 while preserving model performance. Figure 2 Overview of training and inference pipeline of Seedance 1.5 pro. Seedance 1.5 pro aims to elevate the ceiling of visual impact and motion expressiveness. Seedance 1.5 pro demonstrates comprehensive advancements in multilingual adaptation, motion expressiveness, camera 2 scheduling, and dialect delivery. Its performance in scenarios such as Chinese film production, short dramas, and traditional performing arts demonstrates significant potential for practical application in multi-shot video generation workflows: Precise Audio-Visual Synchronization and Multilingual Support. The model realizes high audio-visual consistency during generation, significantly improving the alignment accuracy of lip movements, intonation, and performance rhythm. It natively supports multiple languages and regional dialects, accurately capturing their unique vocal prosody and emotional tension. This capability imparts natural performance quality to stylized narratives, such as comedies and animations, thereby greatly enhancing character atmosphere and expressiveness. Cinematic Camera Control and Dynamic Tension. The model possesses autonomous camera scheduling capabilities, enabling the execution of complex movements such as continuous long takes and dolly zooms (Hitchcock zoom). Additionally, it achieves cinematic scene transitions and professional color grading, substantially enhancing the dynamic tension of the video. Enhanced Semantic Understanding and Narrative Coherence. Through strengthened semantic understanding, Seedance 1.5 pro achieves precise analysis of narrative contexts. It significantly improves the overall narrative coordination of audio-visual segments, providing strong support for professional-grade content creation. Seedance 1.5 pro is scheduled to be integrated into multiple platforms, including Doubao1 and Jimeng2, by December 2025. We envision this model serving as vital productivity tool, designed to enhance both professional workflows and daily creative applications.As AIGC video generation evolves toward deeper multimodal integration, the incorporation of "

Generative pretraining using next embedding prediction outperforms traditional self-supervised methods in visual learning tasks, achieving high accuracy on ImageNet and effective transfer to semantic segmentation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Inspired by the success of generative pretraining in natural language, we ask whether the same principles can yield strong self-supervised visual learners. Instead of training models to output features for downstream use, we train them to generate embeddings to perform predictive tasks directly. This work explores such a shift from learning representations to learning models. Specifically, models learn to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones, using causal masking and stop gradient, which we refer to as Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA). We demonstrate that a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as its sole learning objective is effective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads. This formulation retains architectural simplicity and scalability, without requiring additional design complexity. NEPA achieves strong results across tasks, attaining 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transferring effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K. We believe generative pretraining from embeddings provides a simple, scalable, and potentially modality-agnostic alternative to visual self-supervised learning.

Alchemist, a meta-gradient-based framework, automatically selects high-quality subsets from large-scale text-image datasets to improve visual quality and training efficiency in Text-to-Image models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models, such as Imagen, Stable Diffusion, and FLUX, have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation. Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training. Experiments on both synthetic and web-crawled datasets demonstrate that Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance. Training on an Alchemist-selected 50% of the data can outperform training on the full dataset.

AuditDM, an automated framework using reinforcement learning, identifies and rectifies failure modes in multimodal LLMs by generating challenging examples, leading to improved performance across benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement.

RePlan, a plan-then-execute framework, enhances instruction-based image editing by combining a vision-language planner with a diffusion editor, achieving superior performance in complex and intricate editing tasks using limited data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Instruction-based image editing enables natural-language control over visual modifications, yet existing models falter under Instruction-Visual Complexity (IV-Complexity), where intricate instructions meet cluttered or ambiguous scenes. We introduce RePlan (Region-aligned Planning), a plan-then-execute framework that couples a vision-language planner with a diffusion editor. The planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and explicitly grounds them to target regions; the editor then applies changes using a training-free attention-region injection mechanism, enabling precise, parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. To strengthen planning, we apply GRPO-based reinforcement learning using 1K instruction-only examples, yielding substantial gains in reasoning fidelity and format reliability. We further present IV-Edit, a benchmark focused on fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits. Across IV-Complex settings, RePlan consistently outperforms strong baselines trained on far larger datasets, improving regional precision and overall fidelity.

To strengthen planning, we apply GRPO-based reinforcement learning using 1K instruction-only examples, yielding substantial gains in reasoning fidelity and format reliability. We further present IV-Edit, a benchmark focused on fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits. Across IV-Complex settings, RePlan consistently outperforms strong baselines trained on far larger datasets, improving regional precision and overall fidelity.

AdaTooler-V, a multimodal large language model, adaptively uses vision tools based on reinforcement learning, improving performance and reducing unnecessary tool invocations in visual reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) benefit from multimodal interleaved chain-of-thought (CoT) with vision tool interactions. However, existing open-source models often exhibit blind tool-use reasoning patterns, invoking vision tools even when they are unnecessary, which significantly increases inference overhead and degrades model performance. To this end, we propose AdaTooler-V, an MLLM that performs adaptive tool-use by determining whether a visual problem truly requires tools. First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements. Moreover, we construct two datasets to support training: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data. Experiments across twelve benchmarks demonstrate the strong reasoning capability of AdaTooler-V, outperforming existing methods in diverse visual reasoning tasks. Notably, AdaTooler-V-7B achieves an accuracy of 89.8\% on the high-resolution benchmark V*, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. All code, models, and data are released.

EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware Multimodal Large Language Model, enhances Visual Emotion Comprehension by verbalizing confidence in emotion predictions, leading to improved reliability and accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC) aims to infer sentiment polarities or emotion categories from affective cues embedded in images. In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems. Project page: https://github.com/wdqqdw/EmoCaliber.
