Text:"JustRL: Scaling 1.5B LLM with Simple RL Recipe 2025-12-19 JustRL: Scaling 1.5B LLM with Simple RL Recipe Bingxiang He1, Zekai Qu1 , Zeyuan Liu1 , Yinghao Chen1, Yuxin Zuo1, Cheng Qian2, Kaiyan Zhang1, Weize Chen1, Chaojun Xiao1, Ganqu Cui3, Ning Ding1, Zhiyuan Liu1 1Tsinghua University Corresponding Authors. # hebx24@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn 2University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign 3Shanghai AI Lab https://huggingface.co/collections/hbx/justrl https://github.com/thunlp/JustRL Abstract Recent advances in reinforcement learning for large language models have converged on increasing complexity: multi-stage training pipelines, dynamic hyperparameter schedules, and curriculum learning strategies. This raises fundamental question: Is this complexity necessary? We present JustRL, minimal approach using single-stage training with fixed hyperparameters that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 1.5B reasoning models (54.9% and 64.3% average accuracy across nine mathematical benchmarks) while using 2 less compute than sophisticated approaches. The same hyperparameters transfer across both models without tuning, and training exhibits smooth, monotonic improvement over 4,000+ steps without the collapses or plateaus that typically motivate interventions. Critically, ablations reveal that adding standard tricks like explicit length penalties and robust verifiers may degrade performance by collapsing exploration. These results suggest that the field may be adding complexity to solve problems that disappear with stable, scaled-up baseline. We release our models and code to establish simple, validated baseline for the community. Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

JustRL achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning models with minimal complexity, using single-stage training and fixed hyperparameters, outperforming sophisticated approaches in terms of compute and stability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in reinforcement learning for large language models have converged on increasing complexity: multi-stage training pipelines, dynamic hyperparameter schedules, and curriculum learning strategies. This raises a fundamental question: Is this complexity necessary? We present JustRL, a minimal approach using single-stage training with fixed hyperparameters that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 1.5B reasoning models (54.9\% and 64.3\% average accuracy across nine mathematical benchmarks) while using 2times less compute than sophisticated approaches. The same hyperparameters transfer across both models without tuning, and training exhibits smooth, monotonic improvement over 4,000+ steps without the collapses or plateaus that typically motivate interventions. Critically, ablations reveal that adding ``standard tricks'' like explicit length penalties and robust verifiers may degrade performance by collapsing exploration. These results suggest that the field may be adding complexity to solve problems that disappear with a stable, scaled-up baseline.

Hearing to Translate benchmarks SpeechLLMs and cascaded systems for speech-to-text translation, finding that cascaded systems are more reliable overall and highlighting the importance of integrating LLMs for high-quality translation.  					AI-generated summary 				 As Large Language Models (LLMs) expand beyond text, integrating speech as a native modality has given rise to SpeechLLMs, which aim to translate spoken language directly, thereby bypassing traditional transcription-based pipelines. Whether this integration improves speech-to-text translation quality over established cascaded architectures, however, remains an open question. We present Hearing to Translate, the first comprehensive test suite rigorously benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems that couple leading speech foundation models (SFM), with multilingual LLMs. Our analysis spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions, including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech. Across this extensive evaluation, we find that cascaded systems remain the most reliable overall, while current SpeechLLMs only match cascades in selected settings and SFMs lag behind both, highlighting that integrating an LLM, either within the model or in a pipeline, is essential for high-quality speech translation.

Исследование сравнивает 5 современных SpeechLLM с 16 сильными каскадными архитектурами, которые объединяют модели речевых основ с многоязычными LLM. Оценка проводилась на 16 бенчмарках, 13 языковых парах и 9 сложных условиях, включая невнятную, шумную и длинную речь. Результаты показывают, что каскадные системы остаются более надежными, а интеграция LLM либо внутри модели, либо в конвейере критически важна для высокого качества перевода речи.",
