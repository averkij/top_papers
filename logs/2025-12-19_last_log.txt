Introduction Mathematical problem-solving remains key benchmark for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike general natural language processing tasks, mathematical problems often require multi-step logical deduction, symbolic manipulation, and long-context understanding. Recent large-scale datasets, such as OpenMathInstruct-2 [21], Skywork-MathQA [24], and NuminaMath [11], have substantially advanced the study of mathematical reasoning in LLMs. Building on these efforts, subsequent datasets such as BackMATH [25] and OpenMathReasoning [15] extend this progress toward competition-level and olympiad-style reasoning. Despite these advances, most existing mathematical reasoning datasets are generated by single mode reasoning models, which produce relatively uniform solution styles and limited variation in reasoning depth or tool usage. At the same time, many recent efforts have focused primarily on increasing the difficulty of competition-style mathematical problems. While highly effective for constructing challenging reasoning data, these datasets tend to focus on formal, competition-style problems that cover relatively narrow range of mathematical domains. As result, current mathematical reasoning datasets capture correctness and complexity but only partially reflect the broader spectrum of reasoning behaviors encountered across diverse mathematical problems. The recently released GPT-OSS family of openweight reasoning models, with gpt-oss-120b [4] as the flagship, offers new opportunity to address these limitations. Unlike prior models, it provides three controllable reasoning modes, high, medium, and low, that produce solutions of varying depth and length, and it can generate exceptionally detailed toolintegrated reasoning traces through extensive Python calls. These capabilities make it possible to construct datasets that capture diverse reasoning styles, selfverification behaviors, and tool-usage patterns that were previously inaccessible. Building on this opportunity, we construct Nemotron-Math1, large-scale mathematical reasoning dataset designed to combine rich reasoning diversity with long-context supervision. On the data side, we curate high-quality mathematical problem set by combining structured, competition-style questions from OpenMathReasoning [15] with diverse, community-driven questions from Math Stack 1https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/NemotronMath-v2 2025 NVIDIA. All rights reserved. Nemotron-Math: Efficient Long-Context Distillation of Mathematical Reasoning from Multi-Mode Supervision Exchange [20] and MathOverflow [19], which together constitute the StackExchange-derived portion (StackExchange-Math) of our dataset. Following prior work, we remove proof-style items and further filter out problems that are too easy for gpt-oss-120b: for each question, the model generates 16 solutions with low reasoning mode (8 with and 8 without Python tool-integrated reasoning (TIR)), and any problem with high pass rate (>= 0.8) is discarded as trivial. This filtering reduces the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) [1] portion, corresponding to the AoPS problems included in [15], from the original 175K problems to 85K, and reduces the StackExchange-Math portion from 651K to 262K, resulting in balanced collection of challenging and nontrivial tasks. From this filtered problem pool, we retain the multimode trajectories generated by gpt-oss-120b under high, medium, and low reasoning modes, each both with and without Python TIR. After removing trajectories that fail to reach the reference answer, the final Nemotron-Math corpus contains 7.5M highquality long-form reasoning traces up to 128K tokens in length, capturing diverse reasoning depths, selfverification styles, and tool-usage behaviors. These properties make Nemotron-Math rich resource for studying long-context and tool-augmented mathematical reasoning. To further enhance the efficiency of long-context fine-tuning on such large-scale data, we propose sequential bucketed training strategy that groups samples by sequence length and trains the model progressively from 16K to 128K tokens. This staged approach enables optimized parallelism configurations at each length scale, significantly improving training throughput and resource utilization. Although it may introduce minor accuracy trade-offs compared to fulllength joint training, the method achieves 23 faster training while maintaining strong overall performance. Building on these developments, our "

MomaGraph-R1, a vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning, achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting task-oriented scene graphs and zero-shot task planning in household environments using the MomaGraph-Scenes dataset and MomaGraph-Bench evaluation suite.  					AI-generated summary 				 Mobile manipulators in households must both navigate and manipulate. This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models, reaching 71.6% accuracy on the benchmark (+11.4% over the best baseline), while generalizing across public benchmarks and transferring effectively to real-robot experiments.

Bidirectional Normalizing Flow (BiFlow) enhances generative modeling by approximating the noise-to-data inverse mapping, significantly improving generation quality and sampling speed compared to standard Normalizing Flows.  					AI-generated summary 				 Normalizing Flows (NFs) have been established as a principled framework for generative modeling. Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow (BiFlow), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude. BiFlow yields state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation ("1-NFE") methods. Following recent encouraging progress on NFs, we hope our work will draw further attention to this classical paradigm.

Nemotron-Math, a large-scale mathematical reasoning dataset, enhances performance and robustness through diverse problem integration and efficient long-context training strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 High-quality mathematical reasoning supervision requires diverse reasoning styles, long-form traces, and effective tool integration, capabilities that existing datasets provide only in limited form. Leveraging the multi-mode generation ability of gpt-oss-120b, we introduce Nemotron-Math, a large-scale mathematical reasoning dataset containing 7.5M solution traces across high, medium, and low reasoning modes, each available both with and without Python tool-integrated reasoning (TIR).   The dataset integrates 85K curated AoPS problems with 262K community-sourced StackExchange-Math problems, combining structured competition tasks with diverse real-world mathematical queries. We conduct controlled evaluations to assess the dataset quality.   Nemotron-Math consistently outperforms the original OpenMathReasoning on matched AoPS problems. Incorporating StackExchange-Math substantially improves robustness and generalization, especially on HLE-Math, while preserving accuracy on math competition benchmarks.   To support efficient long-context training, we develop a sequential bucketed strategy that accelerates 128K context-length fine-tuning by 2--3times without significant accuracy loss. Overall, Nemotron-Math enables state-of-the-art performance, including 100\% maj@16 accuracy on AIME 2024 and 2025 with Python TIR.
