[ 1 6 7 5 2 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r upled While reinforcement learning have achieved impressive progress in language model reasoning, they are constrained by the requirement for verifiable rewards. Recent verifier-free RL methods address this limitation by utilizing the intrinsic probabilities of LLMs generating reference answers as reward signals.

By constructing and optimizing composite distribution that integrates these two distributions, CoVRL enables efficient exploration while preserving strong thought-answer coherence. Extensive experiments on mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that CoVRL improves performance by 12.4% over the base model and achieves an additional 2.3% improvement over strong state-of-the-art verifierfree RL baselines, providing principled framework for enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of language models. ariational 1.

Correspondence to: Yaojie Lu <luyaojie@iscas.ac.cn>, Jie Lou <loujie0822@gmail.com>. Figure 1. Comparison between verifier-free RL with question-only training and CoVRL. Unlike prior methods that sample reasoning traces conditioned only on the question, CoVRL couples questionconditioned prior sampling with answer-conditioned posterior sampling via hybrid variational framework, enabling efficient exploration while preserving strong traceanswer coherence. ties, demonstrating impressive results in mathematical tasks. In this paradigm, the LLM generates chain of thought (Wei et al., 2023) followed by an answer, and rule-based program evaluates the final answer, assigning binary rewards based on correctness. The model is then optimized using policy gradient methods such as GRPO (Shao et al., 2024). However, these techniques require verifiable rewards, which restricts their applicability to other domains where formal verification of model answers is challenging or impossible. natural solution to this constraint is to introduce an LLM as verifier (Ma et al., 2025), which performs role similar to that of the reward model in reinforcement learning from human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022). However, this approach requires strong verifier and faces the risk of reward hacking (Skalse et al., 2025). As an alternative, verifier-free methods (Yu et al., 2025b; Tang et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025a; Chen et al., 2024) have emerged that utilize the probabilities LLMs assign to correct answers as reward signals. These methods view answer generation as process that relies on set of implicit reasoning steps. In this formulation, each potential reasoning trace is treated as latent 1 Coupled Variational Reinforcement Learning for Language Model General Reasoning variable contributing to the final answer. The probability of the correct answer is obtained by marginalizing over all plausible reasoning traces conditioned on the input question. In practice, the model is trained using reinforcement learning by sampling different intermediate thoughts for each question and using the probability of generating the correct answer from each thought as the reward. While these methods eliminate external verifiers, they typically rely on question-only generation, i.e., the model observes the question and then attempts to generate reasoning steps leading to the final answer. As shown in Figure 1, this strategy faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Low sample efficiency, particularly for difficult questions where the model struggles to produce useful reasoning traces without guidance; and (2) Potential incoherence between reasoning traces and final answers due to the lack of answer guidance during trace generation, where even correct reasoning may receive low rewards because the final answer is expressed in different format from the ground truth. In this work, we propose Coupled Variational Reinforcement Learning (CoVRL), which frames reasoning training as variational optimization problem that couples prior and posterior distributions. The core idea is to address the challenges of question-only training by establishing coupling between two complementary distributions for sampling reasoning traces during training. We leverage both prior and posterior distributions as variational components, corresponding to two complementary generation modes: (1) question-only generation, which samples traces from the prior distribution, reflecting real inference conditions; and (2) answer-guided generation, which samples traces from the posterior distribution to generate coherent reasoning that leads to the correct answer. This dual-mode strategy provides answer guidance during training while ensuring that the learned reasoning patterns transfer effectively to inference, thereby improving sample efficiency and mitigating incoherence between reasoning traces and answers. To implement this, we construct composite distribution that combines the prior and posterior probabilities, establishing coupled training framework. Since directly sampling from this composite distribution is computationally complex, we adopt hybrid sampling strategy where we randomly select between the two generation modes for each training example. We then maximize variational lower bound, which includes reconstruction term for answer prediction and regularization term to ensure transferability to inference. Through importance weighting, we enable seamless training across both modes using the same underlying language model with different prompt templates. In summary, our main contributions include: We formulate reasoning optimization as variational inference problem and introduce composite distr"

Generative Refocusing uses semi-supervised learning with DeblurNet and BokehNet to achieve high-quality single-image refocusing with controllable bokeh and text-guided adjustments.  					AI-generated summary 				 Depth-of-field control is essential in photography, but getting the perfect focus often takes several tries or special equipment. Single-image refocusing is still difficult. It involves recovering sharp content and creating realistic bokeh. Current methods have significant drawbacks. They need all-in-focus inputs, depend on synthetic data from simulators, and have limited control over aperture. We introduce Generative Refocusing, a two-step process that uses DeblurNet to recover all-in-focus images from various inputs and BokehNet for creating controllable bokeh. Our main innovation is semi-supervised training. This method combines synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, using EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics beyond what simulators can provide. Our experiments show we achieve top performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Additionally, our Generative Refocusing allows text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes.

N3D-VLM integrates native 3D perception and reasoning in vision-language models, enabling precise 3D localization and spatial understanding with a large-scale dataset.  					AI-generated summary 				 While current multimodal models can answer questions based on 2D images, they lack intrinsic 3D object perception, limiting their ability to comprehend spatial relationships and depth cues in 3D scenes. In this work, we propose N3D-VLM, a novel unified framework that seamlessly integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding. Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset. Moreover, the pipeline generates spatial question-answering datasets that target chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in 3D, facilitating joint training for both 3D object localization and 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D grounding tasks, but also consistently surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language model.

CoVRL, a hybrid approach combining variational inference and reinforcement learning, enhances language model reasoning by coupling prior and posterior distributions, improving performance and coherence.  					AI-generated summary 				 While reinforcement learning have achieved impressive progress in language model reasoning, they are constrained by the requirement for verifiable rewards. Recent verifier-free RL methods address this limitation by utilizing the intrinsic probabilities of LLMs generating reference answers as reward signals. However, these approaches typically sample reasoning traces conditioned only on the question. This design decouples reasoning-trace sampling from answer information, leading to inefficient exploration and incoherence between traces and final answers. In this paper, we propose \b{Coupled Variational Reinforcement Learning} (CoVRL), which bridges variational inference and reinforcement learning by coupling prior and posterior distributions through a hybrid sampling strategy. By constructing and optimizing a composite distribution that integrates these two distributions, CoVRL enables efficient exploration while preserving strong thought-answer coherence. Extensive experiments on mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that CoVRL improves performance by 12.4\% over the base model and achieves an additional 2.3\% improvement over strong state-of-the-art verifier-free RL baselines, providing a principled framework for enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of language models.
