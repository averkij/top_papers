Text:"FinForge: Semi-Synthetic Financial Benchmark Generation Glenn Matlin1 2 3, Akhil Theerthala1 *, Anant Gupta3 *, Anirudh Jaidev Mahesh2, Yi Mei Ng2, Rayan Castilla3, Sudheer Chava1 2 3 1Financial Services Innovation Lab, Georgia Institute of Technology 2College of Business, Georgia Institute of Technology 3College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology glenn@gatech.edu, akhiltvsn@gmail.com, agupta886@gatech.edu Abstract Evaluating Language Models (LMs) in specialized, highstakes domains such as finance remains significant challenge due to the scarcity of open, high-quality, and domainspecific datasets. Existing general-purpose benchmarks provide broad coverage but lack the depth and domain fidelity needed to assess LMs capabilities for real-world financial reasoning, which requires both conceptual understanding and quantitative rigor. To address this gap, we introduce FinForge, scalable, semi-synthetic pipeline for constructing finance-specific evaluation benchmarks through hybrid of expert-guided data curation and controlled LM-based synthesis. FinForge combines manual and programmatic corpus construction from authoritative financial sources with structured question generation and validation using Gemini 2.5 Flash. To demonstrate the pipelines efficacy, we produce FinForge-5k, snapshot *Equal Contribution Copyright 2026, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. benchmark comprising over 5,000 human-validated questionanswer pairs across 11 finance subdomains, derived from curated corpus of 100,000 verified documents totaling 143M tokens. Evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models on FinForge-5k reveals significant differences in financial reasoning, with leading models achieving accuracy levels near 80%. These findings underscore the frameworks utility for diagnosing current model limitations and guiding future improvements in financial domain competence. All code and data are avai"

EvoToken-DLM introduces a diffusion-based language modeling approach that uses soft token distributions and continuous trajectory supervision to enable revisable decoding and outperforms existing baselines.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative for language modeling by enabling parallel decoding through iterative refinement. However, most DLMs rely on hard binary masking and discrete token assignments, which hinder the revision of early decisions and underutilize intermediate probabilistic representations. In this paper, we propose EvoToken-DLM, a novel diffusion-based language modeling approach that replaces hard binary masks with evolving soft token distributions. EvoToken-DLM enables a progressive transition from masked states to discrete outputs, supporting revisable decoding. To effectively support this evolution, we introduce continuous trajectory supervision, which aligns training objectives with iterative probabilistic updates. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that EvoToken-DLM consistently achieves superior performance, outperforming strong diffusion-based and masked DLM baselines.

FinForge presents a scalable semi-synthetic pipeline for creating domain-specific financial evaluation benchmarks using expert curation and language model synthesis, demonstrating significant variations in financial reasoning capabilities among state-of-the-art models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Evaluating Language Models (LMs) in specialized, high-stakes domains such as finance remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of open, high-quality, and domain-specific datasets. Existing general-purpose benchmarks provide broad coverage but lack the depth and domain fidelity needed to assess LMs' capabilities for real-world financial reasoning, which requires both conceptual understanding and quantitative rigor. To address this gap, we introduce FinForge, a scalable, semi-synthetic pipeline for constructing finance-specific evaluation benchmarks through a hybrid of expert-guided data curation and controlled LM-based synthesis. FinForge combines manual and programmatic corpus construction from authoritative financial sources with structured question generation and validation using Gemini 2.5 Flash. To demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy, we produce FinForge-5k, a snapshot benchmark comprising over 5,000 human-validated question-answer pairs across 11 finance subdomains, derived from a curated corpus of 100,000 verified documents totaling 143M tokens. Evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models on FinForge-5k reveals significant differences in financial reasoning, with leading models achieving accuracy levels near 80%. These findings underscore the framework's utility for diagnosing current model limitations and guiding future improvements in financial domain competence. All code and data are available at https://github.com/gtfintechlab/FinForge.

"FinForge presents a scalable semi-synthetic pipeline for creating domain-specific financial evaluation benchmarks using expert curation and language model synthesis, demonstrating significant variations in financial reasoning capabilities among state-of-the-art models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Evaluating Language Models (LMs) in specialized, high-stakes domains such as finance remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of open, high-quality, and domain-specific datasets. Existing general-purpose benchmarks provide broad coverage but lack the depth and domain fidelity needed to assess LMs' capabilities for real-world financial reasoning, which requires both conceptual understanding and quantitative rigor. To address this gap, we introduce FinForge, a scalable, semi-synthetic pipeline for constructing finance-specific evaluation benchmarks through a hybrid of expert-guided data curation and controlled LM-based synthesis. FinForge combines manual and programmatic corpus construction from authoritative financial sources with structured question generation and validation using Gemini 2.5 Flash. To demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy, we produce FinForge-5k, a snapshot benchmark comprising over 5,000 human-validated question-answer pairs across 11 finance subdomains, derived from a curated corpus of 100,000 verified documents totaling 143M tokens. Evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models on FinForge-5k reveals significant differences in financial reasoning, with leading models achieving accuracy levels near 80%. These findings underscore the framework's utility for diagnosing current model limitations and guiding future improvements in financial domain competence. All code and data are available at https://github.com/gtfintechlab/FinForge."
