Text:"TODO: Fix the Mess Gemini Created: Towards Understanding GenAI-Induced Self-Admitted Technical Debt Abdullah Al Mujahid Mia Mohammad Imran Missouri University of Science and Technology Missouri University of Science and Technology Department of Computer Science Department of Computer Science Rolla, MO, USA Rolla, MO, USA amgzc@mst.edu imranm@mst.edu 6 2 0 2 2 1 ] . [ 1 6 8 7 7 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r Abstract As large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and Gemini become integrated into software development workflows, developers increasingly leave traces of AI involvement in their code comments. Among these, some comments explicitly acknowledge both the use of generative AI and the presence of technical shortcomings. Analyzing 6,540 LLM-referencing code comments from public Python and JavaScript-based GitHub repositories (November 2022July 2025), we identified 81 that also self-admit technical debt (SATD). Developers most often describe postponed testing, incomplete adaptation, and limited understanding of AI-generated code, suggesting that AI assistance affects both when and why technical debt emerges. We term GenAI-Induced Self-admitted Technical debt (GIST) as proposed conceptual lens to describe recurring cases where developers incorporate AI-generated code while explicitly expressing uncertainty about its behavior or correctness. CCS Concepts Software and its engineering Software maintenance tools; Maintaining software; General and reference Empirical studies; Human-centered computing Open source software. Keywords self-admitted technical debt, generative AI, large language models, AI-assisted software development, human-AI collaboration ACM Reference Format: Abdullah Al Mujahid and Mia Mohammad Imran. 2026.

A framework is presented that enables dynamic regulation of memory reliance in LLM-based agents, allowing users to control the balance between innovation and historical fidelity in long-term interactions.  					AI-generated summary 				 As LLM-based agents are increasingly used in long-term interactions, cumulative memory is critical for enabling personalization and maintaining stylistic consistency. However, most existing systems adopt an ``all-or-nothing'' approach to memory usage: incorporating all relevant past information can lead to Memory Anchoring, where the agent is trapped by past interactions, while excluding memory entirely results in under-utilization and the loss of important interaction history. We show that an agent's reliance on memory can be modeled as an explicit and user-controllable dimension. We first introduce a behavioral metric of memory dependence to quantify the influence of past interactions on current outputs. We then propose Steerable Memory Agent, SteeM, a framework that allows users to dynamically regulate memory reliance, ranging from a fresh-start mode that promotes innovation to a high-fidelity mode that closely follows interaction history. Experiments across different scenarios demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms conventional prompting and rigid memory masking strategies, yielding a more nuanced and effective control for personalized human-agent collaboration.

Analysis of AI-referencing code comments reveals that developers explicitly acknowledge technical debt in AI-assisted code, identifying patterns of postponed testing, incomplete adaptation, and limited understanding as key factors in AI-induced technical debt emergence.  					AI-generated summary 				 As large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and Gemini become integrated into software development workflows, developers increasingly leave traces of AI involvement in their code comments. Among these, some comments explicitly acknowledge both the use of generative AI and the presence of technical shortcomings. Analyzing 6,540 LLM-referencing code comments from public Python and JavaScript-based GitHub repositories (November 2022-July 2025), we identified 81 that also self-admit technical debt(SATD). Developers most often describe postponed testing, incomplete adaptation, and limited understanding of AI-generated code, suggesting that AI assistance affects both when and why technical debt emerges. We term GenAI-Induced Self-admitted Technical debt (GIST) as a proposed conceptual lens to describe recurring cases where developers incorporate AI-generated code while explicitly expressing uncertainty about its behavior or correctness.
