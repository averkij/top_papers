Text:"6 2 0 2 2 1 ] . [ 1 9 3 2 7 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r Tanmay Joshi1, Shourya Aggarwal1, Anusa Saha1, Aadi Pandey1, Shreyash Dhoot1, Vighnesh Rai1, Raxit Goswami2, Aman Chadha3, Vinija Jain4, Amitava Das 2Raapid Lab, USA 3Apple, USA 4Google, USA, 1Pragya Lab, BITS Pilani Goa, India Abstract Deterministic inference is comforting ideal in classical software: the same program on the same input should always produce the same output. As large language models (LLMs) move into real-world deployment, this ideal has been imported wholesale into inference stacks. Recent work from the Thinking Machines Lab has presented detailed analysis of nondeterminism in LLM inference, showing in widely discussed blog post how batch-invariant kernels and deterministic attention can be used to enforce bitwise-identical outputs for given prompt, effectively positioning deterministic inference as prerequisite for reproducibility, onpolicy RL, and enterprise reliability. In this paper, we take the opposite stance. We argue that, for LLMs, deterministic inference kills: it kills the ability to model uncertainty, makes emergent abilities vanish, disrupts reasoning abilities by killing multiple reasoning paths, and renders safety alignment brittle so that we lose honest generalization. LLMs implement conditional distributions pθ(y x), not fixed functions (x); collapsing these distributions to single canonical output per prompt may feel reassuring, but it systematically hides the very properties that matter for artificial cognition. We instead advocate Stochastic CHAOSand claim that distributional variability is the heart of artificial cognition. We begin by disentangling algorithmic stochasticityintentional sampling in decoding (temperature, top-k/top-p, self-consistency, tree-of-thought)from numerical and systems nondeterminism (batching and floating-point artifacts even at temperature 0), and introduce three distinct stability goals for LLM inference: bitwise determinism (same bits, any load), distributio"

Deterministic inference in large language models suppresses uncertainty modeling, emergent abilities, and safety awareness by enforcing single-output predictions instead of maintaining distributional variability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deterministic inference is a comforting ideal in classical software: the same program on the same input should always produce the same output. As large language models move into real-world deployment, this ideal has been imported wholesale into inference stacks. Recent work from the Thinking Machines Lab has presented a detailed analysis of nondeterminism in LLM inference, showing how batch-invariant kernels and deterministic attention can enforce bitwise-identical outputs, positioning deterministic inference as a prerequisite for reproducibility and enterprise reliability.   In this paper, we take the opposite stance. We argue that, for LLMs, deterministic inference kills. It kills the ability to model uncertainty, suppresses emergent abilities, collapses reasoning into a single brittle path, and weakens safety alignment by hiding tail risks. LLMs implement conditional distributions over outputs, not fixed functions. Collapsing these distributions to a single canonical completion may appear reassuring, but it systematically conceals properties central to artificial cognition. We instead advocate Stochastic CHAOS, treating distributional variability as a signal to be measured and controlled.   Empirically, we show that deterministic inference is systematically misleading. Single-sample deterministic evaluation underestimates both capability and fragility, masking failure probability under paraphrases and noise. Phase-like transitions associated with emergent abilities disappear under greedy decoding. Multi-path reasoning degrades when forced onto deterministic backbones, reducing accuracy and diagnostic insight. Finally, deterministic evaluation underestimates safety risk by hiding rare but dangerous behaviors that appear only under multi-sample evaluation.

GRPO-style fine-tuning with MTQE models as rewards improves idiom translation by 14 points while enhancing general translation and cross-lingual capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Non-compositional expressions (e.g., idioms, proverbs, and metaphors) pose significant challenges for neural machine translation systems because their meanings cannot be derived from individual words alone. These expressions encode rich, cultural meaning, and have both figurative and literal meanings, making accurate translation difficult. Because models are fairly good at translating compositional text, we investigate GRPO-style fine-tuning using Machine Translation Quality Estimation (MTQE) models as reward functions to train models to better translate idioms. Using Chinese and Hindi idiom datasets, we find that idiom translation abilities improve by ~14 points, general, non-idiomatic translation implicitly improves by ~8 points, and cross-lingual translation abilities (trained on one language, evaluated on another) improves by ~6 points. Overall, our work quantifies the non-compositional translation gap and offers insights for developing LLMs with stronger cross-cultural and figurative language understanding.

SPINAL diagnoses how DPO alignment reshapes representations layer by layer, revealing geometric localization of preference gradients in final decoder blocks and enabling practical auditing of alignment progress.  					AI-generated summary 				 Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a principled, scalable alternative to RLHF for aligning large language models from pairwise preferences, but its internal geometric footprint remains undercharacterized, limiting audits, checkpoint comparisons, and failure prediction. We introduce SPINAL (Scaling-law and Preference Integration in Neural Alignment Layers), a diagnostic that measures how alignment reshapes representations across depth by tracing localized structural change layer by layer. Across model families, DPO produces a layerwise calibration effect concentrated in the final decoder blocks (often layers 21-30), where preference gradients most directly affect the next-token distribution. SPINAL encodes each checkpoint as a depth trace over (layer index, contraction score, transport score). The contraction score summarizes how quickly the tail of a layer's spectrum decays (how fast small modes vanish); higher values indicate stronger contraction into fewer effective directions. The transport score summarizes how much the token distribution shifts between adjacent layers using a bounded overlap measure; lower values indicate shorter, smoother steps through representation space. Aligned checkpoints show a late-layer ramp-up in contraction and a smooth reduction in transport, consistent with tightened and stabilized policy mass, while unaligned models trace higher-curvature, more entropic, and geometrically incoherent depth paths. Overall, alignment is geometrically localized: the final layers encode the dominant preference-induced corrections. SPINAL turns this localization into a practical audit signal, quantifying where alignment concentrates, how strongly it manifests, and when it begins to destabilize during training.

Этот подход позволяет практически аудировать прогресс выравнивания и предсказывать нестабильность обучения.",

"SPINAL diagnoses how DPO alignment reshapes representations layer by layer, revealing geometric localization of preference gradients in final decoder blocks and enabling practical auditing of alignment progress.  					AI-generated summary 				 Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a principled, scalable alternative to RLHF for aligning large language models from pairwise preferences, but its internal geometric footprint remains undercharacterized, limiting audits, checkpoint comparisons, and failure prediction. We introduce SPINAL (Scaling-law and Preference Integration in Neural Alignment Layers), a diagnostic that measures how alignment reshapes representations across depth by tracing localized structural change layer by layer. Across model families, DPO produces a layerwise calibration effect concentrated in the final decoder blocks (often layers 21-30), where preference gradients most directly affect the next-token distribution. SPINAL encodes each checkpoint as a depth trace over (layer index, contraction score, transport score). The contraction score summarizes how quickly the tail of a layer's spectrum decays (how fast small modes vanish); higher values indicate stronger contraction into fewer effective directions. The transport score summarizes how much the token distribution shifts between adjacent layers using a bounded overlap measure; lower values indicate shorter, smoother steps through representation space. Aligned checkpoints show a late-layer ramp-up in contraction and a smooth reduction in transport, consistent with tightened and stabilized policy mass, while unaligned models trace higher-curvature, more entropic, and geometrically incoherent depth paths. Overall, alignment is geometrically localized: the final layers encode the dominant preference-induced corrections. SPINAL turns this localization into a practical audit signal, quantifying where alignment concentrates, how strongly it manifests, and when it begins to destabilize during training."
