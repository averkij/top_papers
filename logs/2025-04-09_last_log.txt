Text:"COIG-P: High-Quality and Large-Scale Chinese Preference Dataset for Alignment with Human Values M-A-P, 2077AIAligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has achieved remarkable success. However, existing Chinese preference datasets are limited by small scale, narrow domain coverage, and lack of rigorous data validation. Additionally, the reliance on human annotators for instruction and response labeling significantly constrains the scalability of human preference datasets. To address these challenges, we design an LLM-based Chinese preference dataset annotation pipeline with no human intervention. Specifically, we crawled and carefully filtered 92k high-quality Chinese queries and employed 15 mainstream LLMs to generate and score chosen-rejected response pairs. Based on it, we introduce COIG-P (Chinese Open Instruction Generalist - Preference), high-quality, large-scale Chinese preference dataset, comprises 1,006k Chinese preference pairs spanning 6 diverse domains: Chat, Code, Math, Logic, Novel, and Role. Building upon COIG-P, to reduce the overhead of using LLMs for scoring, we trained 8B-sized Chinese Reward Model (CRM) and meticulously constructed Chinese Reward Benchmark (CRBench). Evaluation results based on AlignBench [Liu et al., 2024a] show that that COIG-P significantly outperforms other Chinese preference datasets, and it brings significant performance improvements ranging from 2% to 12% for the Qwen2/2.5 and Infinity-Instruct-3M-0625 model series, respectively.

Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) [OpenAI, 2024, Yang et al., 2024b,a, Dubey et al., 2024] have achieved remarkable success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks [Wu et al., 2025, Team et al., 2025, Wu et al., 2024, Li et al., 2024b, Wang et al., 2023, Kalla et al., 2023, Ray, 2023, Firat, 2023, Bang et al., 2023]. To enable LLMs to be better applied in real-life scenarios, researchers utilize reinforcement learning (RL) technology (e.g., PPO [Schulman et al., 2017], DPO [Rafailov et al., 2023], RLHF [Ziegler et al., 2019]) to endow the LLMs with grasping the human intention and preference.

The human preference alignment datasets. The Quality Check means whether the author demonstrated the quality of the dataset on the downstream task by training model. As one of the most widely spoken languages, Chinese holds significant value in the development of open-source datasets, which are crucial for fostering progress within the Chinese open-source NLP community. However, as shown in Table 1, Chinese human value preference datasets remain scarce and lack rigorous data validation, especially when compared to their English counterparts. On one hand, existing Chinese human preference datasets are not only limited in quantity but also suffer from quality issues. Notably, many of these datasets are derived from single source (e.g., zhihu)1, leading to concerns about representativeness and diversity. Moreover, some datasets lack rigorous data filtering and quality control processes, raising questions about their reliability and validity. On the other hand, introducing human annotation for chosen and rejected responses requires substantial human resources, and the inconsistency of manual annotations significantly increases the cost of data labeling. Although UltraFeedback [Cui et al., 2023] also uses the LLMs to annotate and score responses, they only use single LLM to score responses, which is likely to introduce bias. Besides, it is hard to choose high-quality chosen-rejected response pairs because they annotate 4 different scores from different dimensions for each response. Inspired by UltraFeedback [Cui et al., 2023], we propose an LLM-based Chinese preference dataset annotation pipeline to curate Chinese preference datasets wi"

"Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has achieved remarkable success. However, existing Chinese preference datasets are limited by small scale, narrow domain coverage, and lack of rigorous data validation. Additionally, the reliance on human annotators for instruction and response labeling significantly constrains the scalability of human preference datasets. To address these challenges, we design an LLM-based Chinese preference dataset annotation pipeline with no human intervention. Specifically, we crawled and carefully filtered 92k high-quality Chinese queries and employed 15 mainstream LLMs to generate and score chosen-rejected response pairs. Based on it, we introduce COIG-P (Chinese Open Instruction Generalist - Preference), a high-quality, large-scale Chinese preference dataset, comprises 1,009k Chinese preference pairs spanning 6 diverse domains: Chat, Code, Math, Logic, Novel, and Role. Building upon COIG-P, to reduce the overhead of using LLMs for scoring, we trained a 8B-sized Chinese Reward Model (CRM) and meticulously constructed a Chinese Reward Benchmark (CRBench). Evaluation results based on AlignBench liu2024alignbenchbenchmarkingchinesealignment show that that COIG-P significantly outperforms other Chinese preference datasets, and it brings significant performance improvements ranging from 2% to 12% for the Qwen2/2.5 and Infinity-Instruct-3M-0625 model series, respectively. The results on CRBench demonstrate that our CRM has a strong and robust scoring ability. We apply it to filter chosen-rejected response pairs in a test split of COIG-P, and our experiments show that it is comparable to GPT-4o in identifying low-quality samples while maintaining efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Our codes and data are released in https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/COIG-P."

Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion/flow models have drawn considerable attention recently due to their remarkable ability to deliver flexible visual creations. Still, high-resolution image synthesis presents formidable challenges due to the scarcity and complexity of high-resolution content. To this end, we present HiFlow, a training-free and model-agnostic framework to unlock the resolution potential of pre-trained flow models. Specifically, HiFlow establishes a virtual reference flow within the high-resolution space that effectively captures the characteristics of low-resolution flow information, offering guidance for high-resolution generation through three key aspects: initialization alignment for low-frequency consistency, direction alignment for structure preservation, and acceleration alignment for detail fidelity. By leveraging this flow-aligned guidance, HiFlow substantially elevates the quality of high-resolution image synthesis of T2I models and demonstrates versatility across their personalized variants. Extensive experiments validate HiFlow's superiority in achieving superior high-resolution image quality over current state-of-the-art methods.
