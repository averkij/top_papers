Extensive experiments show that OmniSVG outperforms existing methods and demonstrates its potential for integration into professional SVG design workflows. 1. Introduction Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) have become cornerstone of modern digital design because of their resolution independence, compact file size, and inherent editability. Widely adopted in professional workflows from UI/UX design to industrial CAD systems, SVG enables precise manipulation of geometric primitives (e.g., Bezier curves, polygons) while maintaining high precision and consistent visual quality across varying resolutions. However, creating high-quality SVG content remains challenging for nonexperts, requiring mastery of specialized tools or intricate XML syntax. To generate SVG contents, existing methods adopt either optimization-based methods or auto-regressive approaches. 1 Optimization-based methods [19, 30, 56] iteratively refine the SVG parameters by optimizing differentiable vector graphics rasterizers. Though these methods are effective in generating SVG icons, they suffer from significant computational overhead when scaling up to intricate samples and produce unstructured outputs with redundant anchor points. In contrast, auto-regressive methods build transformer models or adapt pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly generate XML parameters [55] or codes [37, 53] to represent SVGs. Benefiting from an end-to-end learning pipeline, the auto-regressive method is more scalable approach [5] as it is able to learn directly from large collection of SVG samples. However, existing auto-regressive approaches are limited to basic SVG contents because of their limited context window length and the scarcity of complex SVG data [9, 20, 49]. To address these limitations, we propose OmniSVG, the first unified framework that harnesses pre-trained VLMs for end-to-end multimodal complex SVG generations. By parameterizing SVG coordinates and commands into discrete tokens, OmniSVG decouples structural logic from low-level geometry, mitigating the coordinate hallucination problem prevalent in code-based LLMs, and produces vivid and colorful SVG results. Benefiting from the next token prediction training objective, OmniSVG is also capable of completing SVGs with diverse generation results given some partial observations. Compared to traditional auto-regressive SVG generation, our method is able to parameterize the SVGs with token length up to 30k, facilitating the generation of complex and high-quality SVGs. Building upon pre-trained VLMs, our method natively integrates the ability to reason upon the visual and textual instructions to synthesize editable, high-fidelity SVGs across diverse domains, from icons to intricate illustrations and anime characters. To advance the development of SVG synthesis, we introduce MMSVG-2M, multi-modal SVG synthesis dataset with two million richly annotated assets, encompassing icons, illustrations, and anime designs. We also establish standardized evaluation protocol, MMSVG-Bench, for three key SVG generation tasks, i.e. Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG, and Character Reference SVG Generation. Extensive experiments show that OmniSVG produces highly detailed and complex SVG contents, surpassing prior arts both quantitatively and qualitatively. To summarize, our key contributions include: We introduce OmniSVG, the first family of end-to-end leverage pre-trained multimodal SVG generators that Vision-Language Models (VLMs), capable of generating complex and detailed SVGs, from simple icons to intricate anime characters. We present MMSVG-2M, large-scale dataset comprising two million SVG assets, along with standardized evaluation protocol for various conditional SVG generation tasks, providing comprehensive resource for future research. Extensive experiments show that OmniSVG surpasses prior SVG generation methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, highlighting its potential for integration into professional SVG design workflows. 2. Related Works Image Vectorization. Recent advances in vectorization leverage diffusion models paired with differentiable rasterizers, such as DiffVG [25]. These methods aim to convert raster images into SVG paths using score distillation sampling (SDS) [32]. Specifically, LIVE [30] employs layerwise optimization strategy with self-crossing loss and undirected distance-guided focus loss; VectorFusion [19] integrates pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model (Stable Diffusion [38]) with SVG-specific regularizers; and SVGDreamer [7] introduces semantic-driven image vectorization process and particle-based SDS loss to enhance visual quality.

Index TermsText-based image editing, diffusion model, latent optimization, attention-based constraint, tuning-free.ways for people to express their thoughts. Recent advancements in large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models [1] [3] have successfully bridged the gap between textual and visual modalities, facilitating the generation of high-quality images from free-form text prompts. However, in addition to creating images from scratch, there is an increasing need to modify existing images based on textual descriptions. This has led to the emergence of text-based image editing (TIE) [4][18], which aims to manipulate input images according to given text prompts while preserving the integrity of other content. Over the past years, diffusion models for TIE have been extensively developed, categorized into: instruction-based training [4], [5], fine-tuning [6], [7], and tuningfree [8][14] methods. This work focuses on tuning-free editing approaches, which adapt existing T2I models for manipulations without extensive retraining or fine-tuning. Two critical concepts in TIE, distinct from T2I generation, are fidelity and editability. Fidelity concerns preserving the original images content in areas that are not intended to be changed. Editability refers to the effectiveness of an editing method in making the desired changes specified by the text prompt. In the realm of diffusion models for TIE, dual-branch editing paradigm such as P2P [8] is commonly adopted, as demonstrated in Fig. 2(a). This approach involves source branch that reconstructs the original image based on the source prompt and target branch Qi Mao and Lan Chen are with the State Key Laboratory of Media Convergence and Communication, Communication University of China. (E-mail: qimao@cuc.edu.cn, chenlaneva@mails.cuc.edu.cn). Yuchao Gu and Mike Zheng Shou are with Show Lab, National University of Singapore. (E-mail: yuchaogu@u.nus.edu, mikeshou@nus.edu.sg). Ming-Hsuan Yang is with the University of California at Merced and Yonsei University. (E-mail: mhyang@ucmerced.edu). (Corresponding Author: Qi Mao) that generates the target image guided by the target prompt. Within this framework, fidelity is achieved through shared inverted noise latents [17], [19], [20] and structural information provided by the source branch [8], [9], [12], [16], [21]. Meanwhile, editability originates from the inherent ability of T2I models to align target text descriptions with visual outputs in the target branch. The fundamental challenge in achieving this balance stems from the varying trade-offs required by different types of edits. For instance, color edits (e.g., Fig. 1(a)) demand high degree of structural consistency to maintain the integrity of the original image. In contrast, object replacements (e.g., Fig. 1(c)) allow for greater editability, requiring only that the pose of the original elements be preserved. As such, poor balance can lead to two undesirable issues in Fig. 1: Over-editing (editability > fidelity): This occurs when the editing method makes excessive changes, prioritizing the text prompt over the original images content. For example, in the second row of Fig. 1(c), although the tiger aligns visually with the target prompt, its posture is heavily altered compared to the original. Under-editing (editability < fidelity): This situation arises when the method fails to sufficiently apply the desired changes in the edited regions, maintaining too much of the original image. As result, the edited image does not accurately reflect the changes specified in the text prompt. For instance, in the last row of Fig. 1(b), while the structure of the coat is well-preserved, its appearance does not align with the modifications required by the target prompt. The existing dual-branch editing paradigm, which mainly utilizes attention injections [8], [9], [12], [21] for structure preservation, lacks an explicit method to balance both fidelity and editability. However, adjustments can only be achieved through hyperparameters such as attention injection timesteps. To address these limitations, we introduce UnifyEdit to explicitly balUNDER REVIEW 2 Fig. 1: Illustration of balancing fidelity and editability. We demonstrate examples of over-, balanced, and under-editing across six types of edits: (a) color change, (b) texture modification (c) object replacement (d) background editing, (e) global style transfer, and (f) human face attribute editing. Over-editing occurs when excessive changes distort the original image, while under-editing results in changes too subtle to meet the text prompts requirements. In contrast, our UnifyEdit balances fidelity and editability within unified framework, ensuring edits "

"Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an important image format widely adopted in graphic design because of their resolution independence and editability. The study of generating high-quality SVG has continuously drawn attention from both designers and researchers in the AIGC community. However, existing methods either produces unstructured outputs with huge computational cost or is limited to generating monochrome icons of over-simplified structures. To produce high-quality and complex SVG, we propose OmniSVG, a unified framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for end-to-end multimodal SVG generation. By parameterizing SVG commands and coordinates into discrete tokens, OmniSVG decouples structural logic from low-level geometry for efficient training while maintaining the expressiveness of complex SVG structure. To further advance the development of SVG synthesis, we introduce MMSVG-2M, a multimodal dataset with two million richly annotated SVG assets, along with a standardized evaluation protocol for conditional SVG generation tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniSVG outperforms existing methods and demonstrates its potential for integration into professional SVG design workflows."

Balancing fidelity and editability is essential in text-based image editing (TIE), where failures commonly lead to over- or under-editing issues. Existing methods typically rely on attention injections for structure preservation and leverage the inherent text alignment capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models for editability, but they lack explicit and unified mechanisms to properly balance these two objectives. In this work, we introduce UnifyEdit, a tuning-free method that performs diffusion latent optimization to enable a balanced integration of fidelity and editability within a unified framework. Unlike direct attention injections, we develop two attention-based constraints: a self-attention (SA) preservation constraint for structural fidelity, and a cross-attention (CA) alignment constraint to enhance text alignment for improved editability. However, simultaneously applying both constraints can lead to gradient conflicts, where the dominance of one constraint results in over- or under-editing. To address this challenge, we introduce an adaptive time-step scheduler that dynamically adjusts the influence of these constraints, guiding the diffusion latent toward an optimal balance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its superiority in achieving a robust balance between structure preservation and text alignment across various editing tasks, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

With powerful large language models (LLMs) demonstrating superhuman reasoning capabilities, a critical question arises: Do LLMs genuinely reason, or do they merely recall answers from their extensive, web-scraped training datasets? Publicly released benchmarks inevitably become contaminated once incorporated into subsequent LLM training sets, undermining their reliability as faithful assessments. To address this, we introduce KUMO, a generative evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing reasoning in LLMs. KUMO synergistically combines LLMs with symbolic engines to dynamically produce diverse, multi-turn reasoning tasks that are partially observable and adjustable in difficulty. Through an automated pipeline, KUMO continuously generates novel tasks across open-ended domains, compelling models to demonstrate genuine generalization rather than memorization. We evaluated 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on 5,000 tasks across 100 domains created by KUMO, benchmarking their reasoning abilities against university students. Our findings reveal that many LLMs have outperformed university-level performance on easy reasoning tasks, and reasoning-scaled LLMs reach university-level performance on complex reasoning challenges. Moreover, LLM performance on KUMO tasks correlates strongly with results on newly released real-world reasoning benchmarks, underscoring KUMO's value as a robust, enduring assessment tool for genuine LLM reasoning capabilities.
