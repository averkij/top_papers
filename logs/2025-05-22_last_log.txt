[22.05.2025 05:12] Abstract 0. Web navigation is a unique domain that can automate many repetitive real-life tasks and is challenging as it requires long-horizon sequential decision making beyond typical multimodal large language model (MLLM) tasks.

Large language model (LLM)-based embedding models, benefiting from large scale pre-training and post-training, have begun to surpass BERT and T5-based models on general-purpose text embedding tasks such as document retrieval. However, a fundamental limitation of LLM embeddings lies in the unidirecti...

[22.05.2025 05:12] Abstract 6. Playing video games requires perception, memory, and planning, exactly the faculties modern large language model (LLM) agents are expected to master.

[22.05.2025 05:12] Abstract 7. Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models achieve promising results, but they fail on the scenarios where the knowledge implied in the text prompt is uncertain. For example, a T2I model released in February would struggle to generate a suitable poster for a movie premiering in April, because the...

[22.05.2025 05:12] Abstract 8. Acquiring detailed 3D scenes typically demands costly equipment, multi-view data, or labor-intensive modeling. Therefore, a lightweight alternative, generating complex 3D scenes from a single top-down image, plays an essential role in real-world applications. While recent 3D generative models have a...

[22.05.2025 05:12] Abstract 9. World models, which predict transitions based on history observation and action sequences, have shown great promise in improving data efficiency for sequential decision making. However, existing world models often require extensive domain-specific training and still produce low-fidelity, coarse pred...

[22.05.2025 05:12] Abstract 10. Human cognition typically involves thinking through abstract, fluid concepts rather than strictly using discrete linguistic tokens. Current reasoning models, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human language, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed point...

[22.05.2025 05:12] Abstract 11. Fine-tuning on open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with proprietary data is now a standard practice for downstream developers to obtain task-specific LLMs. Surprisingly, we reveal a new and concerning risk along with the practice: the creator of the open-source LLMs can later extract the privat...

[22.05.2025 05:12] Abstract 12. Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving complex problems through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly by generating long reasoning traces.

[22.05.2025 05:12] Abstract 13. Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success on reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematics and programming.

[22.05.2025 05:12] Abstract 14. Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in mathematical and logical reasoning.

[22.05.2025 05:12] Abstract 15. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have been seen as a promising competitor for autoregressive language models. However, diffusion language models have long been constrained by slow inference. A core challenge is that their non-autoregressive architecture and bidirectional attention preclude the key-v...

[22.05.2025 05:12] Abstract 16. Traditional visual grounding methods primarily focus on single-image scenarios with simple textual references.

[22.05.2025 05:12] Abstract 22. In standard autoregressive generation, an LLM predicts the next-token distribution, samples a discrete token, and then discards the distribution, passing only the sampled token as new input. To preserve this distribution's rich information, we propose Mixture of Inputs (MoI), a training-free method ...
