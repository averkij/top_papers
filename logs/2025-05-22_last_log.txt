Large language model (LLM)-based embedding models, benefiting from large scale pre-training and post-training, have begun to surpass BERT and T5-based models on general-purpose text embedding tasks such as document retrieval. However, a fundamental limitation of LLM embeddings lies in the unidirectional attention used during autoregressive pre-training, which misaligns with the bidirectional nature of text embedding tasks. To this end, We propose adopting diffusion language models for text embeddings, motivated by their inherent bidirectional architecture and recent success in matching or surpassing LLMs especially on reasoning tasks. We present the first systematic study of the diffusion language embedding model, which outperforms the LLM-based embedding model by 20% on long-document retrieval, 8% on reasoning-intensive retrieval, 2% on instruction-following retrieval, and achieve competitive performance on traditional text embedding benchmarks. Our analysis verifies that bidirectional attention is crucial for encoding global context in long and complex text.

Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in mathematical and logical reasoning. However, current LRMs rarely admit ignorance or respond with "I don't know". Instead, they often produce incorrect answers while showing undue confidence, raising concerns about their factual reliability. In this work, we identify two pathological reasoning patterns characterized by overthinking that contribute to the overconfident and incorrect answers: last-minute guessing and second-thought spiraling. To address these issues, we propose BARREL-a novel framework that promotes concise and boundary-aware factual reasoning. Our experiments show that BARREL-training increases the reliability of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 39.33% to 61.48%, while still achieving accuracy comparable to models finetuned on reasoning data generated by R1. These results demonstrate that our pilot study is inspiring to build more reliable and factual System 2 LRMs.

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving complex problems through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly by generating long reasoning traces. However, these extended outputs often exhibit substantial redundancy, which limits the efficiency of LRMs. In this paper, we investigate RL-based approaches to promote reasoning efficiency. Specifically, we first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient reasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on this perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method (LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target length. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal balance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based on two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during training, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and dynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of thought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be difficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries. This approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow thinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff. The resulting method is termed LASER-D (Dynamic and Difficulty-aware). Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B show that our approach significantly enhances both reasoning performance and response length efficiency. For instance, LASER-D and its variant achieve a +6.1 improvement on AIME2024 while reducing token usage by 63%. Further analysis reveals our RL-based compression produces more concise reasoning patterns with less redundant "self-reflections". Resources are at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/Laser.

"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving complex problems through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly by generating long reasoning traces. However, these extended outputs often exhibit substantial redundancy, which limits the efficiency of LRMs. In this paper, we investigate RL-based approaches to promote reasoning efficiency. Specifically, we first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient reasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on this perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method (LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target length. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal balance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based on two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during training, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and dynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of thought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be difficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries. This approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow thinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff. The resulting method is termed LASER-D (Dynamic and Difficulty-aware). Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B show that our approach significantly enhances both reasoning performance and response length efficiency. For instance, LASER-D and its variant achieve a +6.1 improvement on AIME2024 while reducing token usage by 63%. Further analysis reveals our RL-based compression produces more concise reasoning patterns with less redundant "self-reflections". Resources are at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/Laser."

Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools across various domains, yet tailoring pre-trained models to exhibit specific desirable properties remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution,current methods struggle to simultaneously achieve stable, efficient fine-tuning and support non-differentiable rewards. Furthermore, their reliance on sparse rewards provides inadequate supervision during intermediate steps, often resulting in suboptimal generation quality. To address these limitations, dense and differentiable signals are required throughout the diffusion process. Hence, we propose VAlue-based Reinforced Diffusion (VARD): a novel approach that first learns a value function predicting expection of rewards from intermediate states, and subsequently uses this value function with KL regularization to provide dense supervision throughout the generation process. Our method maintains proximity to the pretrained model while enabling effective and stable training via backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach facilitates better trajectory guidance, improves training efficiency and extends the applicability of RL to diffusion models optimized for complex, non-differentiable reward functions.

Playing video games requires perception, memory, and planning, exactly the faculties modern large language model (LLM) agents are expected to master. We study the major challenges in using popular video games to evaluate modern LLMs and find that directly dropping LLMs into games cannot make an effective evaluation, for three reasons -- brittle vision perception, prompt sensitivity, and potential data contamination. We introduce lmgame-Bench to turn games into reliable evaluations. lmgame-Bench features a suite of platformer, puzzle, and narrative games delivered through a unified Gym-style API and paired with lightweight perception and memory scaffolds, and is designed to stabilize prompt variance and remove contamination. Across 13 leading models, we show lmgame-Bench is challenging while still separating models well. Correlation analysis shows that every game probes a unique blend of capabilities often tested in isolation elsewhere. More interestingly, performing reinforcement learning on a single game from lmgame-Bench transfers both to unseen games and to external planning tasks. Our evaluation code is available at https://github.com/lmgame-org/GamingAgent/lmgame-bench.
