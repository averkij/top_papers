Text:"Streamline Without Sacrifice - Squeeze out Computation Redundancy in LMM Penghao Wu 1 Lewei Lu 2 Ziwei Liu 1 5 2 0 2 1 2 ] . [ 1 6 1 8 5 1 . 5 0 5 2 : r Abstract Large multimodal models excel in multimodal tasks but face significant computational challenges due to excessive computation on visual tokens. Unlike token reduction methods that focus on token-level redundancy, we identify and study the computation-level redundancy on vision tokens to ensure no information loss. Our key insight is that vision tokens from the pretrained vision encoder do not necessarily require all the heavy operations (e.g., self-attention, FFNs) in decoder-only LMMs and could be processed more lightly with proper designs. We designed series of experiments to discover and progressively squeeze out the vision-related computation redundancy. Based on our findings, we propose ProxyV, novel approach that utilizes proxy vision tokens to alleviate the computational burden on original vision tokens. ProxyV enhances efficiency without compromising performance and can even yield notable performance gains in scenarios with more moderate efficiency improvements. Furthermore, the flexibility of ProxyV is demonstrated through its combination with token reduction methods to boost efficiency further. The code will be made public here. 1. Introduction Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities by combining visual information with large language models (LLMs), but their computational overhead can be immense due to the large number of vision tokens. To mitigate this, most existing efforts address token-level redundancy by pruning or merging vision tokens with the risk of discarding fine-grained details. In this paper, we instead tackle the computation-level redundancy on vision tokens, an often-overlooked dimension.

Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory resources, creating deployment challenges. Quantization-aware training (QAT) addresses these challenges by reducing model precision while maintaining performance. However, the scaling behavior of QAT, especially at 4-bit precision (W4A4), is not well understood. Existing QAT scaling laws often ignore key factors such as the number of training tokens and quantization granularity, which limits their applicability. This paper proposes a unified scaling law for QAT that models quantization error as a function of model size, training data volume, and quantization group size. Through 268 QAT experiments, we show that quantization error decreases as model size increases, but rises with more training tokens and coarser quantization granularity. To identify the sources of W4A4 quantization error, we decompose it into weight and activation components. Both components follow the overall trend of W4A4 quantization error, but with different sensitivities. Specifically, weight quantization error increases more rapidly with more training tokens. Further analysis shows that the activation quantization error in the FC2 layer, caused by outliers, is the primary bottleneck of W4A4 QAT quantization error. By applying mixed-precision quantization to address this bottleneck, we demonstrate that weight and activation quantization errors can converge to similar levels. Additionally, with more training data, weight quantization error eventually exceeds activation quantization error, suggesting that reducing weight quantization error is also important in such scenarios. These findings offer key insights for improving QAT research and development.

We introduce MMaDA, a novel class of multimodal diffusion foundation models designed to achieve superior performance across diverse domains such as textual reasoning, multimodal understanding, and text-to-image generation. The approach is distinguished by three key innovations: (i) MMaDA adopts a unified diffusion architecture with a shared probabilistic formulation and a modality-agnostic design, eliminating the need for modality-specific components. This architecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data types. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities. By aligning reasoning processes between textual and visual domains, this strategy facilitates cold-start training for the final reinforcement learning (RL) stage, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex tasks from the outset. (iii) We propose UniGRPO, a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm specifically tailored for diffusion foundation models. Utilizing diversified reward modeling, UniGRPO unifies post-training across both reasoning and generation tasks, ensuring consistent performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that MMaDA-8B exhibits strong generalization capabilities as a unified multimodal foundation model. It surpasses powerful models like LLaMA-3-7B and Qwen2-7B in textual reasoning, outperforms Show-o and SEED-X in multimodal understanding, and excels over SDXL and Janus in text-to-image generation. These achievements highlight MMaDA's effectiveness in bridging the gap between pretraining and post-training within unified diffusion architectures, providing a comprehensive framework for future research and development.

Web navigation is a unique domain that can automate many repetitive real-life tasks and is challenging as it requires long-horizon sequential decision making beyond typical multimodal large language model (MLLM) tasks. Yet, specialized reward models for web navigation that can be utilized during both training and test-time have been absent until now. Despite the importance of speed and cost-effectiveness, prior works have utilized MLLMs as reward models, which poses significant constraints for real-world deployment. To address this, in this work, we propose the first process reward model (PRM) called Web-Shepherd which could assess web navigation trajectories in a step-level. To achieve this, we first construct the WebPRM Collection, a large-scale dataset with 40K step-level preference pairs and annotated checklists spanning diverse domains and difficulty levels. Next, we also introduce the WebRewardBench, the first meta-evaluation benchmark for evaluating PRMs. In our experiments, we observe that our Web-Shepherd achieves about 30 points better accuracy compared to using GPT-4o on WebRewardBench. Furthermore, when testing on WebArena-lite by using GPT-4o-mini as the policy and Web-Shepherd as the verifier, we achieve 10.9 points better performance, in 10 less cost compared to using GPT-4o-mini as the verifier. Our model, dataset, and code are publicly available at LINK.

Knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation seeks to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) caused by insufficient or outdated knowledge. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the prior knowledge embedded in knowledge graphs (KGs), particularly their structural information and explicit or implicit constraints. The former can enhance the faithfulness of LLMs' reasoning, while the latter can improve the reliability of response generation. Motivated by these, we propose a trustworthy reasoning framework, termed Deliberation over Priors (DP), which sufficiently utilizes the priors contained in KGs. Specifically, DP adopts a progressive knowledge distillation strategy that integrates structural priors into LLMs through a combination of supervised fine-tuning and Kahneman-Tversky optimization, thereby improving the faithfulness of relation path generation. Furthermore, our framework employs a reasoning-introspection strategy, which guides LLMs to perform refined reasoning verification based on extracted constraint priors, ensuring the reliability of response generation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DP achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially a Hit@1 improvement of 13% on the ComplexWebQuestions dataset, and generates highly trustworthy responses. We also conduct various analyses to verify its flexibility and practicality. The code is available at https://github.com/reml-group/Deliberation-on-Priors.

Scaling up high-quality trajectory data has long been a critical bottleneck for developing human-like computer use agents. We introduce PC Agent-E, an efficient agent training framework that significantly reduces reliance on large-scale human demonstrations. Starting with just 312 human-annotated computer use trajectories, we further improved data quality by synthesizing diverse action decisions with Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Trained on these enriched trajectories, our PC Agent-E model achieved a remarkable 141% relative improvement, surpassing the strong Claude 3.7 Sonnet with extended thinking on WindowsAgentArena-V2, an improved benchmark we also released. Furthermore, PC Agent-E demonstrates strong generalizability to different operating systems on OSWorld. Our findings suggest that strong computer use capabilities can be stimulated from a small amount of high-quality trajectory data.

Acquiring detailed 3D scenes typically demands costly equipment, multi-view data, or labor-intensive modeling. Therefore, a lightweight alternative, generating complex 3D scenes from a single top-down image, plays an essential role in real-world applications. While recent 3D generative models have achieved remarkable results at the object level, their extension to full-scene generation often leads to inconsistent geometry, layout hallucinations, and low-quality meshes. In this work, we introduce 3DTown, a training-free framework designed to synthesize realistic and coherent 3D scenes from a single top-down view. Our method is grounded in two principles: region-based generation to improve image-to-3D alignment and resolution, and spatial-aware 3D inpainting to ensure global scene coherence and high-quality geometry generation. Specifically, we decompose the input image into overlapping regions and generate each using a pretrained 3D object generator, followed by a masked rectified flow inpainting process that fills in missing geometry while maintaining structural continuity. This modular design allows us to overcome resolution bottlenecks and preserve spatial structure without requiring 3D supervision or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across diverse scenes show that 3DTown outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including Trellis, Hunyuan3D-2, and TripoSG, in terms of geometry quality, spatial coherence, and texture fidelity. Our results demonstrate that high-quality 3D town generation is achievable from a single image using a principled, training-free approach.

Machine learning-based interatomic potentials and force fields depend critically on accurate atomic structures, yet such data are scarce due to the limited availability of experimentally resolved crystals. Although atomic-resolution electron microscopy offers a potential source of structural data, converting these images into simulation-ready formats remains labor-intensive and error-prone, creating a bottleneck for model training and validation. We introduce AutoMat, an end-to-end, agent-assisted pipeline that automatically transforms scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images into atomic crystal structures and predicts their physical properties. AutoMat combines pattern-adaptive denoising, physics-guided template retrieval, symmetry-aware atomic reconstruction, fast relaxation and property prediction via MatterSim, and coordinated orchestration across all stages. We propose the first dedicated STEM2Mat-Bench for this task and evaluate performance using lattice RMSD, formation energy MAE, and structure-matching success rate. By orchestrating external tool calls, AutoMat enables a text-only LLM to outperform vision-language models in this domain, achieving closed-loop reasoning throughout the pipeline. In large-scale experiments over 450 structure samples, AutoMat substantially outperforms existing multimodal large language models and tools. These results validate both AutoMat and STEM2Mat-Bench, marking a key step toward bridging microscopy and atomistic simulation in materials science.The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/yyt-2378/AutoMat and https://huggingface.co/datasets/yaotianvector/STEM2Mat.

Human cognition typically involves thinking through abstract, fluid concepts rather than strictly using discrete linguistic tokens. Current reasoning models, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human language, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in the semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and upper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration of reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling one token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free method that emulates human-like "soft" reasoning by generating soft, abstract concept tokens in a continuous concept space. These concept tokens are created by the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the continuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer representations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence, each generated concept token encapsulates multiple meanings from related discrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge effectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse mathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points while simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard CoT. Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain highly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking to break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning.

"Human cognition typically involves thinking through abstract, fluid concepts rather than strictly using discrete linguistic tokens. Current reasoning models, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human language, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in the semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and upper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration of reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling one token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free method that emulates human-like "soft" reasoning by generating soft, abstract concept tokens in a continuous concept space. These concept tokens are created by the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the continuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer representations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence, each generated concept token encapsulates multiple meanings from related discrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge effectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse mathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points while simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard CoT. Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain highly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking to break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning. Code is available at https://github.com/eric-ai-lab/Soft-Thinking."

Fine-tuning on open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with proprietary data is now a standard practice for downstream developers to obtain task-specific LLMs. Surprisingly, we reveal a new and concerning risk along with the practice: the creator of the open-source LLMs can later extract the private downstream fine-tuning data through simple backdoor training, only requiring black-box access to the fine-tuned downstream model. Our comprehensive experiments, across 4 popularly used open-source models with 3B to 32B parameters and 2 downstream datasets, suggest that the extraction performance can be strikingly high: in practical settings, as much as 76.3% downstream fine-tuning data (queries) out of a total 5,000 samples can be perfectly extracted, and the success rate can increase to 94.9% in more ideal settings. We also explore a detection-based defense strategy but find it can be bypassed with improved attack. Overall, we highlight the emergency of this newly identified data breaching risk in fine-tuning, and we hope that more follow-up research could push the progress of addressing this concerning risk. The code and data used in our experiments are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/Backdoor-Data-Extraction.

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success on reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, their enhanced reasoning capabilities do not necessarily translate to improved safety performance-and in some cases, may even degrade it. This raises an important research question: how can we enhance the safety of LRMs? In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study on how to enhance the safety of LRMs through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our investigation begins with an unexpected observation: directly distilling safe responses from DeepSeek-R1 fails to significantly enhance safety. We analyze this phenomenon and identify three key failure patterns that contribute to it. We then demonstrate that explicitly addressing these issues during the data distillation process can lead to substantial safety improvements. Next, we explore whether a long and complex reasoning process is necessary for achieving safety. Interestingly, we find that simply using short or template-based reasoning process can attain comparable safety performance-and are significantly easier for models to learn than more intricate reasoning chains. These findings prompt a deeper reflection on the role of reasoning in ensuring safety. Finally, we find that mixing math reasoning data during safety fine-tuning is helpful to balance safety and over-refusal. Overall, we hope our empirical study could provide a more holistic picture on enhancing the safety of LRMs. The code and data used in our experiments are released in https://github.com/thu-coai/LRM-Safety-Study.

World models, which predict transitions based on history observation and action sequences, have shown great promise in improving data efficiency for sequential decision making. However, existing world models often require extensive domain-specific training and still produce low-fidelity, coarse predictions, limiting their applicability in complex environments. In contrast, video diffusion models trained on large, internet-scale datasets have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality videos that capture diverse real-world dynamics. In this work, we present Vid2World, a general approach for leveraging and transferring pre-trained video diffusion models into interactive world models. To bridge the gap, Vid2World performs casualization of a pre-trained video diffusion model by crafting its architecture and training objective to enable autoregressive generation. Furthermore, it introduces a causal action guidance mechanism to enhance action controllability in the resulting interactive world model. Extensive experiments in robot manipulation and game simulation domains show that our method offers a scalable and effective approach for repurposing highly capable video diffusion models to interactive world models.

"World models, which predict transitions based on history observation and action sequences, have shown great promise in improving data efficiency for sequential decision making. However, existing world models often require extensive domain-specific training and still produce low-fidelity, coarse predictions, limiting their applicability in complex environments. In contrast, video diffusion models trained on large, internet-scale datasets have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality videos that capture diverse real-world dynamics. In this work, we present Vid2World, a general approach for leveraging and transferring pre-trained video diffusion models into interactive world models. To bridge the gap, Vid2World performs casualization of a pre-trained video diffusion model by crafting its architecture and training objective to enable autoregressive generation. Furthermore, it introduces a causal action guidance mechanism to enhance action controllability in the resulting interactive world model. Extensive experiments in robot manipulation and game simulation domains show that our method offers a scalable and effective approach for repurposing highly capable video diffusion models to interactive world models."

Traditional visual grounding methods primarily focus on single-image scenarios with simple textual references. However, extending these methods to real-world scenarios that involve implicit and complex instructions, particularly in conjunction with multiple images, poses significant challenges, which is mainly due to the lack of advanced reasoning ability across diverse multi-modal contexts. In this work, we aim to address the more practical universal grounding task, and propose UniVG-R1, a reasoning guided multimodal large language model (MLLM) for universal visual grounding, which enhances reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) combined with cold-start data. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) grounding dataset, annotated with detailed reasoning chains, to guide the model towards correct reasoning paths via supervised fine-tuning. Subsequently, we perform rule-based reinforcement learning to encourage the model to identify correct reasoning chains, thereby incentivizing its reasoning capabilities. In addition, we identify a difficulty bias arising from the prevalence of easy samples as RL training progresses, and we propose a difficulty-aware weight adjustment strategy to further strengthen the performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of UniVG-R1, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIG-Bench with a 9.1% improvement over the previous method. Furthermore, our model exhibits strong generalizability, achieving an average improvement of 23.4% in zero-shot performance across four image and video reasoning grounding benchmarks.

Large multimodal models excel in multimodal tasks but face significant computational challenges due to excessive computation on visual tokens. Unlike token reduction methods that focus on token-level redundancy, we identify and study the computation-level redundancy on vision tokens to ensure no information loss. Our key insight is that vision tokens from the pretrained vision encoder do not necessarily require all the heavy operations (e.g., self-attention, FFNs) in decoder-only LMMs and could be processed more lightly with proper designs. We designed a series of experiments to discover and progressively squeeze out the vision-related computation redundancy. Based on our findings, we propose ProxyV, a novel approach that utilizes proxy vision tokens to alleviate the computational burden on original vision tokens. ProxyV enhances efficiency without compromising performance and can even yield notable performance gains in scenarios with more moderate efficiency improvements. Furthermore, the flexibility of ProxyV is demonstrated through its combination with token reduction methods to boost efficiency further. The code will be made public at this https://github.com/penghao-wu/ProxyV URL.

Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific discovery. Existing approaches, however, often automate scientific discovery using predefined workflows that lack rationality constraints. This often leads to aimless hypothesizing and a failure to consistently link hypotheses with evidence, thereby hindering systematic uncertainty reduction. Overcoming these limitations fundamentally requires systematic uncertainty reduction. We introduce PiFlow, an information-theoretical framework, treating automated scientific discovery as a structured uncertainty reduction problem guided by principles (e.g., scientific laws). In evaluations across three distinct scientific domains -- discovering nanomaterial structures, bio-molecules, and superconductor candidates with targeted properties -- our method significantly improves discovery efficiency, reflected by a 73.55\% increase in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of property values versus exploration steps, and enhances solution quality by 94.06\% compared to a vanilla agent system. Overall, PiFlow serves as a Plug-and-Play method, establishing a novel paradigm shift in highly efficient automated scientific discovery, paving the way for more robust and accelerated AI-driven research. Code is publicly available at our https://github.com/amair-lab/PiFlow{GitHub}.

Overall, PiFlow serves as a Plug-and-Play method, establishing a novel paradigm shift in highly efficient automated scientific discovery, paving the way for more robust and accelerated AI-driven research. Code is publicly available at our https://github.com/amair-lab/PiFlow{GitHub}."

"Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific discovery. Existing approaches, however, often automate scientific discovery using predefined workflows that lack rationality constraints. This often leads to aimless hypothesizing and a failure to consistently link hypotheses with evidence, thereby hindering systematic uncertainty reduction. Overcoming these limitations fundamentally requires systematic uncertainty reduction. We introduce PiFlow, an information-theoretical framework, treating automated scientific discovery as a structured uncertainty reduction problem guided by principles (e.g., scientific laws). In evaluations across three distinct scientific domains -- discovering nanomaterial structures, bio-molecules, and superconductor candidates with targeted properties -- our method significantly improves discovery efficiency, reflected by a 73.55\% increase in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of property values versus exploration steps, and enhances solution quality by 94.06\% compared to a vanilla agent system.

World models predict state transitions in response to actions and are increasingly developed across diverse modalities. However, standard training objectives such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) often misalign with task-specific goals of world models, i.e., transition prediction metrics like accuracy or perceptual quality. In this paper, we present RLVR-World, a unified framework that leverages reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to directly optimize world models for such metrics. Despite formulating world modeling as autoregressive prediction of tokenized sequences, RLVR-World evaluates metrics of decoded predictions as verifiable rewards. We demonstrate substantial performance gains on both language- and video-based world models across domains, including text games, web navigation, and robot manipulation. Our work indicates that, beyond recent advances in reasoning language models, RLVR offers a promising post-training paradigm for enhancing the utility of generative models more broadly.
