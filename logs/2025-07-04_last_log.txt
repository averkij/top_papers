Text:"Can LLMs Identify Critical Limitations within Scientific Research? Systematic Evaluation on AI Research Papers Zhijian XuY Yilun Zhao Manasi Patwardhan T5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 4 9 6 2 0 . 7 0 5 2 : r aPeer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of publications has intensified the challenges of this expertiseintensive process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations, remains understudied. We first present comprehensive taxonomy of limitation types in scientific research, with focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for studying limitations, we present LIMITGEN, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs capability to support early-stage feedback and complement human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LIMITGEN-Syn, synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of highquality papers, and LIMITGEN-Human, collection of real human-written limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers, enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback. Data Code yale-nlp/LimitGen yale-nlp/LimitGenPeer review plays crucial role in ensuring the quality and integrity of scientific research. However, it is often time-consuming and expertise-intensive process, posing significant challenges, especially as the volume of published papers continues to grow. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across variety of scientific tasks, such as answering questions about scientific papers (Xu Equal Contributions. Figure 1: Overview of the research: the limitation generation task and three research questions investigated. et al., 2024), writing scientific papers (Chamoun et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024), retrieving related works (Ajith et al., 2024; Press et al., 2024), improving idea generation (Wang et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024b; Si et al., 2024), and generating code to perform data-driven discovery (Huang et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2024). Meanwhile, there is increasing interest in exploring the potential of LLMs to assist with or generate peer reviews (Liang et al., 2024; Liu and Shah, 2023; DArcy et al., 2024; Lou et al., 2024), which can be used to provide quick and early feedback to researchers and potentially alleviate some of the burdens associated with traditional review processes. High-quality reviews are supposed to pinpoint the limitations of paper and provide concrete, actionable suggestions, assisting researchers in improving their work. Existing benchmarks for peerreview generation collect papers and their corresponding entire reviews from AI conferences (Du et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024; Tan et al., 2024), but these benchmarks generally do not emphasize the importance of limitation identifications. Instead, they compare the overall quality of LLM-generated versus human-written reviews (Liang et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024) and assess adherence to conference guidelines (Tyser et al., 2024). As opposed to other aspects of review generation, such as summary, strengths, syntactic or structural errors or request for elaboration, identification of limitations is the key aspect to facilitate future technical enhancement of the work and it is of utmonst importance from the research growth point of view. To address this gap, we present the first in-depth study and evaluation of LLM systems in identifying the limitations of scientific papers. To do so, we first provide comprehensive taxonomy of types of limitations in scientific fields of study, with focus on AI.1 Then guided by this taxonomy, we propose LIMITGEN-Syn, synthetic benchmark focusing on various categories of limitations. LIMITGEN-Syn systematically introduces controlled perturbations to high-quality papers to create scenarios where specific limitations are present. These perturbations include selective removal of crucial information such as experimental details, inadequate evaluation metrics, omission of key baseline comparisons, and constraints on datasets or methodologies. By carefully controlling these modifications, we can reliably evaluate how well LLM agents detect different types of limitations. In addition, LIMITGEN-Syn also allows capturing suggestions on how to resolve the identified limitation. To assess whether our taxonomy and the synthetic benchmark can effectively capture the diverse categories of limitations identified by humans in real-world peer review settings, we then collect human-written limitations from ICLR 2025 submissions as LIMITGEN-Human. We chose ICLR 2025 to mitigate contamination and also because ICLR peer reviews are often of high-quality due to the public nature of reviews and an extensive rebuttal process. Together, these two datasets form comprehensive benchmark for advancing identification of limitations in papers. Limitation identification is knowledgeintensive task, requiring years of expertise and staying current with rapidly evolving literature. In 1We chose AI as this is the field we are familiar with. In 6.3 we also perform user study to how our findings generalize to other domains. terms of modeling, in such settings, retrieval plays crucial role as it is challenging to keep LLM agents up-to-date in rapidly evolving fields. While Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been applied to enhancing scientific workflow, such as conducting literature reviews (Agarwal et al., 2024; Asai et al., 2024) and answering domain-specific questions (Xu et al., 2024; Skarlinski et al., 2024), it has not yet been explored in the context of peerreviews. RAG also simulates how human identify limitations of papers by implicitly or explicitly referring to existing body of (often recent) literature and thus facilitate in grounding the generated limitations in existing scientific findings. We enhance limitation generation by leveraging RAG techniques. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to query the Semantic Scholar API to retrieve papers related to the one under review, extracting relevant content to enrich their domain understanding. Our results demonstrate that incorporating RAG improves the ability of LLM systems to generate limitations i"
