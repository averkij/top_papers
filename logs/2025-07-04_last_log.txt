Text:"5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 8 7 7 2 0 . 7 0 5 2 : r SELF-CORRECTION BENCH: REVEALING AND ADDRESSING THE SELF-CORRECTION BLIND SPOT IN LLMS PREPRINT Ken Tsui Independent kenhktsui@gmail.com July 4,Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is an important capability for trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit systematic Self-Correction Blind Spot - failing to correct identical error in their own outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction Bench, systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences, unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback. Remarkably, simply appending Wait reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving their reliability and trustworthiness. have not failed. Ive just found 10,000 ways that wont work. Thomas A. EdisonLarge Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced natural language processing, achieving state-of-the-art results on diverse range of tasks (OpenAI et al., 2024; Anthropic, 2024; Gemini Team, 2025; Yang et al., 2025; Meta, 2025; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a). However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are known to exhibit unpredictable failures and generate inaccurate information (Huang et al., 2025; Bang et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Nezhurina et al., 2025). particularly concerning issue is the tendency of LLMs to make seemingly random errors even on simple tasks, despite possessing the underlying knowledge required for correct solutions. This raises fundamental questions about their reliability and trustworthiness, hindering their deployment in critical applications. Observing LLM self-correction behavior in natural settings is challenging due to their inherent accuracy; the rarity of naturally occurring errors makes systematic evaluation challenging. To address this limitation, we construct SelfCorrection Bench by systematically injecting error into the LLM reasoning traces. This allows us to create controlled environments for testing self-correction and reliably quantifying performance using dedicated benchmarks. This approach also allows us to simulate real-world imperfections and assess the robustness of LLMs in realistic scenarios. Our results reveal that LLMs are not good at self-correction, not because of knowledge. We refer to the phenomenon as Self-Correction Blind Spot. We further demonstrate that appending simple Wait and other correction markers can induce self-correction performance without finetuning, suggesting that the core issue is not knowledge deficiency, but rather lack of activation for self-correction. We provide behavioral explanation for why Wait works, supported by systematic analysis of Self-Correction Bench: Revealing and Addressing the Self-Correction Blind Spot in LLMs PREPRINT correction marker patterns and post training data. We also analyze why the RL trained reasoning model does not have the blind spot. Our contributions are as follows. Discover and quantify the Self-Correction Blind Spot - LLMs systematically fail to correct their own error while succeeding on identical external error (64.5% average across 14 models) Establish systematic evaluation methodology - Self-Correction Bench with controlled error injection across three complexity levels, enabling fair cross-model comparison Human demonstrations rarely include self-correction sequences, unlike RL models that learn error-correction through outcome feedback Demonstrate simple yet effective intervention - Appending Wait reduces blind spots by 89.3%, with behavioral explanation supported by correction marker analysisIntrinsic Self-correction in LLMs: Recent work has shown that intrinsic self-correction improves performance by prompting the same LLM to generate feedback on their own responses (Kim et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Kamoi et al., 2024). In particular, it indicates that LLMs struggle to rectify mistakes because the quality of the models self-feedback is bounded by existing knowledge. (Kim et al., 2023) and (Shinn et al., 2023) use an oracle label to guide feedback. However, without access to the oracle label Huang et al. (2024) has identified limitations in the LLMs ability to self-correct error, while Tyen et al. (2024) demonstrates that poor self-correction performance is due to the inability to localize rather than correct an error. Most works require multiple-step prompting, while our focus is on single-pass inference, in which LLM is expected to self-correct in one completion. We further study self-correction from cognitive perspective rather than the limitation due to model knowledge. Recent work understands why some LLMs thrive and some do not in outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) from cognitive point of view (Gandhi et al., 2025). The study uses supervised finetuning (SFT) to elicit backtracking behavior, while our focus is on self-correction, including backtracking, and we use correction markers to elicit such cognitive behavior without finetuning. Kumar et al. (2024) tackles self-correction with RL, leads to significantly positive intrinsic self-correction, while DeepSeek-AI et al. (2025a)s training does not explicitly single out self-correction but instead rely on ground truth to provide signal. They observe that the aha moment when LLM learns to allocate more time to re-evaluate its initial approach (i.e. self correction). Prompt Injection for Evaluation: Traditional prompt injection technique focuses on adversarial scenarios in which attackers inject malicious instruction or prefix to manipulate LLM output (Wei et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024). However, controlled error injection has not been systematically explored to test the self-correction capability. Lanham et al. (2023) injects mistakes into reasoning chains to evaluate the faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning. However, their focus is on measuring co"

InnerControl enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps by training lightweight convolutional probes to improve control fidelity and generation quality in text-to-image diffusion models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps. Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents, enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++, InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning methods (e.g., edges, depth).
