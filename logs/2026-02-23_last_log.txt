[ 1 3 9 6 0 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aTraining stability remains central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs). Policy staleness, asynchronous training, and mismatches between training and inference engines all cause the behavior policy to diverge from the current policy, risking training collapse. Importance sampling provides principled correction for this distribution shift but suffers from high variance; existing remedies such as token-level clipping and sequence-level normalization lack unified theoretical foundation. We propose Variational sEquence-level Soft Policy Optimization (VESPO). By incorporating variance reduction into variational formulation over proposal distributions, VESPO derives closedform reshaping kernel that operates directly on sequence-level importance weights without length normalization. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that VESPO maintains stable training under staleness ratios up to 64 and fully asynchronous execution, and delivers consistent gains across both dense and Mixtureof-Experts models. Code is available at https: //github.com/FloyedShen/VESPO. 1. Introduction Reinforcement learning (RL) has become key technique for tackling complex problem-solving tasks with large language models (LLMs), enabling capabilities such as multistep mathematical reasoning and code generation (OpenAI, 2024; Anthropic, 2025; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025). In practice, off-policy updates arise naturally in RL pipelines for LLMs. common source is that systems split large rollout batches into mini-batches for sequential updates (Yang 1Xiaohongshu Inc. Shen <floyed shen@outlook.com>, shan2@xiaohongshu.com>. Preprint. February 12, 2026. Correspondence to: Guobin Xing Yu <yuanFigure 1. Left: VESPO reformulates IS weight reshaping as finding proposal that balances proximity to µ and π under variance constraint. Right: Training reward (gbs/mbs=4) on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base. et al., 2025), causing later batches to become stale relative to the evolving policy. Asynchronous systems (Fu et al., 2025; Zhong et al., 2025; Noukhovitch et al., 2025) amplify this by decoupling rollout from training entirely. Traininginference mismatches introduce further discrepancies, especially in MoE models where routing decisions compound through layers. To stabilize training under such distribution mismatch, existing works adopt truncated importance sampling (TIS) (Liu et al., 2025), mask out off-policy samples from training (Hu, 2025), or replay expert routing for target policy inference (Zheng et al., 2025b; Ma et al., 2025). While PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) enforces trust region constraints via clipping, it does not directly address the variance challenge of sequence-level importance sampling (IS). Existing methods address this challenge through various importance weight transformations. Most operate at the token level: GRPO (Shao et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) applies PPO-style clipping to per-token ratios; other methods such as SAPO (Gao et al., 2025) design heuristic transformations for off-policy importance weights (Xi et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025c; Dwyer et al., 2025; Roux et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025). However, token-level transformations are compromise to avoid the multiplicative variance explosion of sequence-level weights, and have been shown to be merely first-order approximation to their sequencelevel counterparts (Zheng et al., 2025b). Sequence-level approaches (Zheng et al., 2025b; Zhao et al., 2025) introduce length normalization to control variance, but this normal1 VESPO: Variational Sequence-Level Soft Policy Optimization ization makes the IS estimator biased; hard clipping is still required on top. Despite these efforts, principled guidance for designing importance weight transformations remains limited. We propose Variational sEquence-level Soft Policy Optimization (VESPO), which takes fundamentally different approach: rather than designing reshaping heuristics, we explicitly incorporate variance reduction for off-policy importance sampling into variational formulation, yielding principled closed-form solution (Figure 1). Additionally, we find that the resulting transformation is particularly friendly to sequence-level optimization: unlike previous methods that rely on length normalization to avoid variance explosion, VESPO operates directly on sequence-level importance weights without approximation or normalization. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We explicitly incorporate variance reduction into variational formulation for importance weight reshaping and derive principled closed-form solution. The resulting algorithm, VESPO, operates directly on sequence-level importance weights, preserving intertoken dependencies while remaining free from lengthdependent bias. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that VESPO remains stable under staleness ratios up to 64 and in fully asynchronous training, delivering consistent improvements across both dense and MoE architectures. 2. Preliminaries Notation. We consider an autoregressive language model parameterized by θ as policy πθ. Let denote query sampled from dataset D. In off-policy settings, responses = (y1, . . . , yT ) are sampled from behavior policy µ (e.g., an earlier checkpoint or different inference engine). The likelihood of generating given factorizes as: πθ(y x) = (cid:89) t=1 πθ(yt x, y<t). (1) We write τ = (x, y) for query-response pair, and R(τ ) for the sequence-level reward assigned to the complete response. Policy Gradient with Off-Policy Correction. The goal is to maximize the expected reward under the current policy: (θ) = Eτ πθ (cid:2)R(τ )(cid:3). (2) When samples are drawn from behavior policy µ instead, importance sampling provides an unbiased correction. Taking the gradient yields the off-policy policy gradient: θJ (θ) = Eτ µ [W (τ ) R(τ ) θ log πθ(τ )] , (3) where (τ ) = πθ(τ )/µ(τ ) is the importance weight. This classical policy gradient view (Sutton et al., 1999) reveals that the importance weight serves as gradient weighting factor: it determines how much each sample contributes to the parameter update. More generally, any modification to the importance weight can be understood as defining reshaping function ϕ(W ) that re"
