[ 1 4 5 3 8 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aRecent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have greatly improved their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through long Chains of Thought (CoTs). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy, impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time applications. Recent studies show that longer reasoning chains are frequently uncorrelated with correctness and can even be detrimental to accuracy. In further in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, we surprisingly uncover and empirically verify that LRMs implicitly know the appropriate time to stop thinking, while this capability is obscured by current sampling paradigms. Motivated by this, we introduce SAGE (Self-Aware Guided Efficient Reasoning), novel sampling paradigm that unleashes this efficient reasoning potential. Furthermore, integrating SAGE as mixed sampling into groupbased reinforcement learning (SAGE-RL) effectively incorporates SAGE-discovered efficient reasoning patterns into standard pass@1 inference, markedly enhancing both the reasoning accuracy and efficiency of LRMs across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks. 1. Introduction Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) algorithms, such as GRPO (Shao et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2026) and GSPO (Zheng et al., 2025a), have played pivotal role in enabling test-time scaling. This capability allows large reasoning models (LRMs) like o3 (OpenAI, 2025a) and DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025) to think longer. Longer CoTs enable LRMs to explore intermediate steps in greater depth and reduce abrupt logical leaps, thereby achieving unprecedented performance on challenging rea1Beihang University 2Bytedance China 3Renmin University of China. Correspondence to: Yikun Ban <yikunb@buaa.edu.cn>, Deqing Wang <dqwang@buaa.edu.cn>. Preprint. February 10, 2026. Figure 1. SAGE unleashes the efficient reasoning potential of LRMs obscured by pass@1 and identifies the optimal completions within the models capability hidden in pass@k. By enabling LRMs to learn these efficient reasoning patterns, SAGE-RL-tuned models simultaneously enhance reasoning capacity and conciseness on multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks. soning benchmarks such as AIME (Art of Problem Solving, 2024), OlympiadBench (Chaoqun et al., 2024) and IMO (Luong et al., 2025). While longer reasoning chains are expected for solving harder problems, prior work shows that length inflation can be uncorrelated with correctness, and that shorter chains may in fact yield better accuracy. For example, Balachandran et al. (2025) observe that on AIME 2025, DeepSeek-R1 produces responses nearly 5 longer than Claude 3.7 Sonnet while achieving comparable accuracy; Hassid et al. (2025) show that on AIME and HMMT, the shortest responses from QwQ-32B outperform randomly sampled ones by 2 percentage points using 31% fewer tokens. These findings collectively reveal that current CoT outputs often contain substantial redundancy and irrelevant tokens that do not Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2026 contribute to the final solution. These unnecessary tokens dramatically reduce reasoning efficiency. This naturally raises pertinent question: do LRMs know the appropriate time to terminate thinking? We find that, during the exploration of multiple reasoning chains, LRMs consistently assign high confidence to concise yet effective reasoning paths. However, current samplingbased inference strategies typically overlook or fail to select these short and effective chains. Moreover, this phenomenon exhibits clear convergence behavior and becomes increasingly pronounced as the exploration space expands. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that reasoning models implicitly know the appropriate moment to terminate their reasoning process, but this capability is obscured by current pass@1 training and inference paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SAGE (Self-Aware Guided Efficient Reasoning), simple yet effective decoding strategy that leverages the reasoning models selfconfidence to discover relatively precise reasoning chains. By incorporating SAGE as mixed sampling into groupbased reinforcement learning (SAGE-RL), we enable the reasoning model to learn concise yet effective thinking patterns without altering its original reasoning paradigm. In summary, our contributions in this work are as follows: We uncover and demonstrate that LRMs implicitly know the appropriate time to stop thinking, but this capability is obscured by current sampling paradigms. We propose SAGE, novel sampling paradigm that unleashes the efficient reasoning potential of LRMs, simultaneously improving both accuracy and conciseness of reasoning chains. We propose SAGE-RL, simple modification to RLVR frameworks that integrates SAGE into the rollout process. As shown in Figure 1, SAGE-RL-tuned models achieve consistent gains across six challenging reasoning benchmarks, including MATH-500, AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AMC23, OlympiaBench and Minerva. 2. Dilemmas of Reasoning Models underTo investigate whether reasoning models possess the ability to recognize the appropriate moment to terminate thinking, we first need to re-examine the dilemmas faced by these models under current sampling paradigms. Pass@k: Scaling CoT length does not lead to correct answers. Assuming that LRMs using current sampling paradigms can reliably stop thinking at the appropriate moment, longer CoTs should outperform shorter ones in leading to correct solutions. However, extensive experiments involving multiple samplings of the same problem refute this assumption. Balachandran et al. (2025) observes that on AIME 2025, DeepSeek-R1 produces responses nearly 5 longer than Claude 3.7 Sonnet while achieving comparable accuracy; Hassid et al. (2025) also shows that on AIME and HMMT, the shortest responses from QwQ-32B outperform randomly sampled ones by 2 percentage points using 31% fewer tokens. Shrivastava et al. (2025) found that, on AIME 2025, in 72% of problems where both correct and incorrect answers were generated, the longer response was more likely to be incorrect than the shorter one.

Text:"EgoPush: Learning End-to-End Egocentric Multi-Object Rearrangement for Mobile Robots Boyuan An, Zhexiong Wang*, Yipeng Wang*, Jiaqi Li, Sihang Li, Jing Zhang, Chen Feng New York University 6 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 1 7 0 8 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Fig. 1: EgoPush: From only egocentric observations, mobile robot builds goal object configurations in the real world (left) and demonstrates structured behaviors in simulation (right), including obstacle avoidance, forming diverse target configurations (e.g., cross/line), and handling objects with varied geometries (cube/prism/cylinder). AbstractHumans can rearrange objects in cluttered environments using egocentric perception, navigating occlusions without global coordinates. Inspired by this capability, we study longhorizon multi-object non-prehensile rearrangement for mobile robots using single egocentric camera. We introduce EgoPush, policy learning framework that enables egocentric, perceptiondriven rearrangement without relying on explicit global state estimation that often fails in dynamic scenes. EgoPush designs an object-centric latent space to encode relative spatial relations among objects, rather than absolute poses. This design enables privileged reinforcement-learning (RL) teacher to jointly learn latent states and mobile actions from sparse keypoints, which is then distilled into purely visual student policy. To reduce the supervision gap between the omniscient teacher and the partially observed student, we restrict the teachers observations to visually accessible cues. This induces active perception behaviors that are recoverable from the students viewpoint. To address longhorizon credit assignment, we decompose rearrangement into stage-level subproblems using temporally decayed, stage-local completion rewards. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that EgoPush significantly outperforms end-to-end RL baselines in success rate, with ablation studies validating each design choice. We further demonstrate zero-shot sim"

Text:"SARAH: Spatially Aware Real-time Agentic Humans Meta Reality Labs Redmond, WA, USA 6 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 2 3 4 8 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Figure 1: Our method generates full-body 3D motion for virtual agent that is spatially aware of the user while engaging in conversation. Given the users floor-projected head trajectory and dyadic audio, we generate the agents complete 3D motion. Trajectory colors indicate time: blue green (user) and yellow red (agent). See project page for results. Abstract As embodied agents become central to VR, telepresence, and digital human applications, their motion must go beyond speech-aligned gestures: agents should turn toward users, respond to their movement, and maintain natural gaze. Current methods lack this spatial awareness. We close this gap with the first real-time, fully causal method for spatially-aware conversational motion, deployable on streaming VR headset. Given users position and dyadic audio, our approach produces full-body motion that aligns gestures with speech while orienting the agent according to the user. Our architecture combines causal transformer-based VAE with interleaved latent tokens for streaming inference and flow matching model conditioned on user trajectory and audio. To support varying gaze preferences, we introduce gaze scoring mechanism with classifierfree guidance to decouple learning from control: the model captures natural spatial alignment from data, while users can adjust eye contact intensity at inference time. On the Embody 3D dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art motion quality at over 300 FPS3 faster than non-causal baselineswhile capturing the subtle spatial dynamics of natural conversation. We validate our approach on live VR system, bringing spatially-aware conversational agents to real-time deployment. See our project page for details. toward their conversational partners, shift posture as they move, and modulate gaze to signal engagement. Moreover, comfort in levels of eye contact vary widel"

Text:"Learning Smooth Time-Varying Linear Policies with an Action Jacobian Penalty ZHAOMING XIE, KEVIN KAROL, and JESSICA HODGINS, Robotics AI Institute, USA 6 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 2 1 3 8 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Fig. 1. Our system is able to learn smooth time-varying linear feedback policies for simulated character to perform challenging motion skills. Reinforcement learning provides framework for learning control policies that can reproduce diverse motions for simulated characters. However, such policies often exploit unnatural high-frequency signals that are unachievable by humans or physical robots, making them poor representations of real-world behaviors. Existing work addresses this issue by adding reward term that penalizes large change in actions over time. This term often requires substantial tuning efforts. We propose to use the action Jacobian penalty, which penalizes changes in action with respect to the changes in simulated state directly through auto differentiation. This effectively eliminates unrealistic high-frequency control signals without task specific tuning. While effective, the action Jacobian penalty introduces significant computational overhead when used with traditional fully connected neural network architectures. To mitigate this, we introduce new architecture called Linear Policy Net (LPN) that significantly reduces the computational burden for calculating the action Jacobian penalty during training. In addition, LPN requires no parameter tuning, exhibits faster learning convergence compared to baseline methods, and can be more efficiently queried during inference time compared to fully connected neural network. We demonstrate that Linear Policy Net, combined with the action Jacobian penalty, is able to learn policies that generate smooth signals while solving number of motion imitation tasks with different characteristics, including dynamic motions such as backflip and various challenging parkour skills.

A human-centric video world model conditioned on tracked head and hand poses is introduced, enabling dexterous interactions through a bidirectional video diffusion model trained for egocentric virtual environment generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Extended reality (XR) demands generative models that respond to users' tracked real-world motion, yet current video world models accept only coarse control signals such as text or keyboard input, limiting their utility for embodied interaction. We introduce a human-centric video world model that is conditioned on both tracked head pose and joint-level hand poses. For this purpose, we evaluate existing diffusion transformer conditioning strategies and propose an effective mechanism for 3D head and hand control, enabling dexterous hand--object interactions. We train a bidirectional video diffusion model teacher using this strategy and distill it into a causal, interactive system that generates egocentric virtual environments. We evaluate this generated reality system with human subjects and demonstrate improved task performance as well as a significantly higher level of perceived amount of control over the performed actions compared with relevant baselines.

EgoPush enables robot manipulation in cluttered environments through perception-driven policy learning that uses object-centric latent spaces and stage-decomposed rewards for long-horizon tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Humans can rearrange objects in cluttered environments using egocentric perception, navigating occlusions without global coordinates. Inspired by this capability, we study long-horizon multi-object non-prehensile rearrangement for mobile robots using a single egocentric camera. We introduce EgoPush, a policy learning framework that enables egocentric, perception-driven rearrangement without relying on explicit global state estimation that often fails in dynamic scenes. EgoPush designs an object-centric latent space to encode relative spatial relations among objects, rather than absolute poses. This design enables a privileged reinforcement-learning (RL) teacher to jointly learn latent states and mobile actions from sparse keypoints, which is then distilled into a purely visual student policy. To reduce the supervision gap between the omniscient teacher and the partially observed student, we restrict the teacher's observations to visually accessible cues. This induces active perception behaviors that are recoverable from the student's viewpoint. To address long-horizon credit assignment, we decompose rearrangement into stage-level subproblems using temporally decayed, stage-local completion rewards. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that EgoPush significantly outperforms end-to-end RL baselines in success rate, with ablation studies validating each design choice. We further demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on a mobile platform in the real world. Code and videos are available at https://ai4ce.github.io/EgoPush/.

A causal transformer-based variational autoencoder combined with flow matching enables real-time, spatially-aware conversational motion for embodied agents in virtual reality applications.  					AI-generated summary 				 As embodied agents become central to VR, telepresence, and digital human applications, their motion must go beyond speech-aligned gestures: agents should turn toward users, respond to their movement, and maintain natural gaze. Current methods lack this spatial awareness. We close this gap with the first real-time, fully causal method for spatially-aware conversational motion, deployable on a streaming VR headset. Given a user's position and dyadic audio, our approach produces full-body motion that aligns gestures with speech while orienting the agent according to the user. Our architecture combines a causal transformer-based VAE with interleaved latent tokens for streaming inference and a flow matching model conditioned on user trajectory and audio. To support varying gaze preferences, we introduce a gaze scoring mechanism with classifier-free guidance to decouple learning from control: the model captures natural spatial alignment from data, while users can adjust eye contact intensity at inference time. On the Embody 3D dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art motion quality at over 300 FPS -- 3x faster than non-causal baselines -- while capturing the subtle spatial dynamics of natural conversation. We validate our approach on a live VR system, bringing spatially-aware conversational agents to real-time deployment. Please see https://evonneng.github.io/sarah/ for details.

"A causal transformer-based variational autoencoder combined with flow matching enables real-time, spatially-aware conversational motion for embodied agents in virtual reality applications.  					AI-generated summary 				 As embodied agents become central to VR, telepresence, and digital human applications, their motion must go beyond speech-aligned gestures: agents should turn toward users, respond to their movement, and maintain natural gaze. Current methods lack this spatial awareness. We close this gap with the first real-time, fully causal method for spatially-aware conversational motion, deployable on a streaming VR headset. Given a user's position and dyadic audio, our approach produces full-body motion that aligns gestures with speech while orienting the agent according to the user. Our architecture combines a causal transformer-based VAE with interleaved latent tokens for streaming inference and a flow matching model conditioned on user trajectory and audio. To support varying gaze preferences, we introduce a gaze scoring mechanism with classifier-free guidance to decouple learning from control: the model captures natural spatial alignment from data, while users can adjust eye contact intensity at inference time. On the Embody 3D dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art motion quality at over 300 FPS -- 3x faster than non-causal baselines -- while capturing the subtle spatial dynamics of natural conversation. We validate our approach on a live VR system, bringing spatially-aware conversational agents to real-time deployment. Please see https://evonneng.github.io/sarah/ for details."

Reinforcement learning policies are improved by using action Jacobian penalty to eliminate unrealistic high-frequency signals, with a new Linear Policy Net architecture reducing computational overhead while enabling faster convergence and efficient inference for motion imitation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning provides a framework for learning control policies that can reproduce diverse motions for simulated characters. However, such policies often exploit unnatural high-frequency signals that are unachievable by humans or physical robots, making them poor representations of real-world behaviors. Existing work addresses this issue by adding a reward term that penalizes a large change in actions over time. This term often requires substantial tuning efforts. We propose to use the action Jacobian penalty, which penalizes changes in action with respect to the changes in simulated state directly through auto differentiation. This effectively eliminates unrealistic high-frequency control signals without task specific tuning. While effective, the action Jacobian penalty introduces significant computational overhead when used with traditional fully connected neural network architectures. To mitigate this, we introduce a new architecture called a Linear Policy Net (LPN) that significantly reduces the computational burden for calculating the action Jacobian penalty during training. In addition, a LPN requires no parameter tuning, exhibits faster learning convergence compared to baseline methods, and can be more efficiently queried during inference time compared to a fully connected neural network. We demonstrate that a Linear Policy Net, combined with the action Jacobian penalty, is able to learn policies that generate smooth signals while solving a number of motion imitation tasks with different characteristics, including dynamic motions such as a backflip and various challenging parkour skills. Finally, we apply this approach to create policies for dynamic motions on a physical quadrupedal robot equipped with an arm.
