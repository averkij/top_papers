Visual Information Gain metric quantifies the contribution of visual input to prediction uncertainty, enabling selective training that improves visual grounding and reduces language bias in vision-language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet they often suffer from language bias, producing answers without relying on visual evidence. While prior work attempts to mitigate this issue through decoding strategies, architectural modifications, or curated instruction data, they typically lack a quantitative measure of how much individual training samples or tokens actually benefit from the image. In this work, we introduce Visual Information Gain (VIG), a perplexity-based metric that measures the reduction in prediction uncertainty provided by visual input. VIG enables fine-grained analysis at both sample and token levels, effectively highlighting visually grounded elements such as colors, spatial relations, and attributes. Leveraging this, we propose a VIG-guided selective training scheme that prioritizes high-VIG samples and tokens. This approach improves visual grounding and mitigates language bias, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced supervision by focusing exclusively on visually informative samples and tokens.

Авторы показывают, что многие современные модели страдают от языкового смещения и не полагаются на визуальные доказательства при ответе на вопросы. На основе VIG они разработали схему избирательного обучения, которая приоритизирует образцы и токены с высокой визуальной информативностью. Такой подход улучшает привязку к визуальному контексту, уменьшает языковое смещение и достигает лучшей производительности с меньшим объёмом данных для обучения.",
