Text:"Decoding as Optimisation 6 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 2 9 2 8 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Decoding as Optimisation on the Probability Simplex: From Top-K to Top-P (Nucleus) to Best-of-K Samplers Xiaotong Ji1,, Rasul Tutunov1, Matthieu Zimmer1, Haitham Bou-Ammar1,2, 1 Huawei Noahs Ark 2 AI Centre, Department of Computer Science, UCL Equal contributions Abstract: Decoding sits between language model and everything we do with it, yet it is still treated as heuristic knob-tuning exercise. We argue decoding should be understood as principled optimisation layer: at each token, we solve regularised problem over the probability simplex that trades off model score against structural preferences and constraints. This single template recovers greedy decoding, Softmax sampling, Top-K, Top-P, and Sparsemax-style sparsity as special cases, and explains their common structure through optimality conditions. More importantly, the framework makes it easy to invent new decoders without folklore. We demonstrate this by designing Best-of-K (BoK), KL-anchored coverage objective aimed at multi-sample pipelines (self-consistency, reranking, verifier selection). BoK targets the probability of covering good alternatives within fixed K-sample budget and improves empirical performance. We show that such samples can improve accuracy by, for example, +18.6% for Qwen2.5-Math-7B on MATH500 at high sampling temperatures. Our message is simple: Decoding is not hack; it is optimisation! Large language model (LLM) decoding is usually taught like cookbook: Top-K [10, 28], temperature [13, 16], Top-P [14, 27], greedy [35, 32], beam search [38, 11]; shelf of tricks you pick from depending on the application[15, 19, 22, 25, 36, 37, 44, 48], whether you want more determinism [12, 34], more diversity [39, 41, 46, 47], or fewer hallucinations [9, 40, 43]. The problem is that this framing makes decoding feel like bag of heuristics: useful, but conceptually disconnected from the rest of machine learning. This paper argues the oppo"

AI-generated summary Decoding sits between a language model and everything we do with it, yet it is still treated as a heuristic knob-tuning exercise. We argue decoding should be understood as a principled optimisation layer: at each token, we solve a regularised problem over the probability simplex that trades off model score against structural preferences and constraints.

BoK targets the probability of covering good alternatives within a fixed K-sample budget and improves empirical performance. We show that such samples can improve accuracy by, for example, +18.6% for Qwen2.5-Math-7B on MATH500 at high sampling temperatures."

Abstract A video segmentation model eliminates specialized tracking modules by using a Vision Transformer encoder with query propagation and fusion mechanisms for efficient, high-speed processing.  					AI-generated summary Existing online video segmentation models typically combine a per-frame segmenter with complex specialized tracking modules. While effective, these modules introduce significant architectural complexity and computational overhead. Recent studies suggest that plain Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders, when scaled with sufficient capacity and large-scale pre-training, can conduct accurate image segmentation without requiring specialized modules. Motivated by this observation, we propose the Video Encoder-only Mask Transformer (VidEoMT), a simple encoder-only video segmentation model that eliminates the need for dedicated tracking modules. To enable temporal modeling in an encoder-only ViT, VidEoMT introduces a lightweight query propagation mechanism that carries information across frames by reusing queries from the previous frame. To balance this with adaptability to new content, it employs a query fusion strategy that combines the propagated queries with a set of temporally-agnostic learned queries. As a result, VidEoMT attains the benefits of a tracker without added complexity, achieving competitive accuracy while being 5x--10x faster, running at up to 160 FPS with a ViT-L backbone.

Abstract Diffusion Language Models suffer from high inference costs due to iterative denoising, prompting the development of Sink-Aware Pruning that identifies and removes unstable attention sinks, improving efficiency without retraining.  					AI-generated summary Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) incur high inference cost due to iterative denoising, motivating efficient pruning. Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors. We show that this assumption does not hold for DLMs: the attention-sink position exhibits substantially higher variance over the full generation trajectory (measured by how the dominant sink locations shift across timesteps), indicating that sinks are often transient and less structurally essential than in AR models. Based on this observation, we propose {bf Sink-Aware Pruning}, which automatically identifies and prunes unstable sinks in DLMs (prior studies usually keep sinks for AR LLMs). Without retraining, our method achieves a better quality-efficiency trade-off and outperforms strong prior pruning baselines under matched compute.

Abstract 4RC presents a unified feed-forward framework for 4D reconstruction from monocular videos that learns holistic scene geometry and motion dynamics through a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with conditional querying capabilities.  					AI-generated summary We present 4RC, a unified feed-forward framework for 4D reconstruction from monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches that typically decouple motion from geometry or produce limited 4D attributes such as sparse trajectories or two-view scene flow, 4RC learns a holistic 4D representation that jointly captures dense scene geometry and motion dynamics. At its core, 4RC introduces a novel encode-once, query-anywhere and anytime paradigm: a transformer backbone encodes the entire video into a compact spatio-temporal latent space, from which a conditional decoder can efficiently query 3D geometry and motion for any query frame at any target timestamp. To facilitate learning, we represent per-view 4D attributes in a minimally factorized form by decomposing them into base geometry and time-dependent relative motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4RC outperforms prior and concurrent methods across a wide range of 4D reconstruction tasks.

"Abstract 4RC presents a unified feed-forward framework for 4D reconstruction from monocular videos that learns holistic scene geometry and motion dynamics through a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with conditional querying capabilities.  					AI-generated summary We present 4RC, a unified feed-forward framework for 4D reconstruction from monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches that typically decouple motion from geometry or produce limited 4D attributes such as sparse trajectories or two-view scene flow, 4RC learns a holistic 4D representation that jointly captures dense scene geometry and motion dynamics. At its core, 4RC introduces a novel encode-once, query-anywhere and anytime paradigm: a transformer backbone encodes the entire video into a compact spatio-temporal latent space, from which a conditional decoder can efficiently query 3D geometry and motion for any query frame at any target timestamp. To facilitate learning, we represent per-view 4D attributes in a minimally factorized form by decomposing them into base geometry and time-dependent relative motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4RC outperforms prior and concurrent methods across a wide range of 4D reconstruction tasks."
