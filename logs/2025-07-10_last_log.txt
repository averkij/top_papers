Text:"VIDEO-RTS: Rethinking Reinforcement Learning and Test-Time Scaling for Efficient and Enhanced Video Reasoning Ziyang Wang* Jaehong Yoon Md Mohaiminul Islam Gedas Bertasius Mohit Bansal5 2 0 2 9 ] . [ 1 5 8 4 6 0 . 7 0 5 2 : r ahttps://sites.google.com/cs.unc.edu/videorts2025/Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations, making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present VIDEO-RTS, new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with video-adaptive test-time scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more efficiently, we introduce sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that VIDEO-RTS surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy using only 3.6% training samples. For example, VIDEO-RTS achieves 4.2% improvement on Video-Holmes, recent and challenging video reasoning benchmark, and 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling VIDEO-RTSs strong reasoning performance.Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities across diverse domains, enabled by techniques such as Chain-ofThought (CoT) reasoning (Wang et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023) and multi-agent collaboration (Talebirad and Nadiri, 2023; Chen et al., 2024b). Building *Equal contribution. 1 on advances in the language domain, several approaches (Liu et al., 2025; Fei et al., 2024; Feng et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025) have recently extended them to improve video reasoning capabilities. However, these methods demand high computational costs and lower training efficiency, typically following an extensive twostage recipe: (i) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on reasoning-focused prompts with step-by-step chainof-thought annotations, followed by (ii) large-scale reinforcement learning using rewards over massive collections of video question-answering data. This pipeline poses substantial computational overhead, particularly in generating long CoT data for video corpus, which limits its scalability for complex, long-term video reasoning tasks. To overcome these limitations and enable efficient video reasoning, we propose VIDEO-RTS, novel approach that integrates data-efficient reinforcement learning with video-adaptive test-time scaling strategies, significantly enhancing reasoning performance while maintaining efficiency. In training, unlike the existing approaches (Wang et al., 2025a; Feng et al., 2025), which rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data with long CoT annotation, we skip the data generation step and directly utilize pure RL training on simple video question-answering (QA) data. Specifically, we adapt the outcome-supervised RL (group relative preference optimization, GRPO (Shao et al., 2024)), motivated by DeepSeek-R1Zero (DeepSeek-AI, 2025), for its simplicity and effectiveness in aligning model outputs with answer correctness. With merely 6K video-question pairs for RL, our approach matches the performance of the existing SFT+RL framework (Video-R1 (Feng et al., 2025)), which relies on 165K SFT examples plus 4K RL examples, underscoring the effectiveness and training efficiency of VIDEO-RTS. Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig. 3, scaling to even more video QA samples only brings marginal Figure 1: Training and inference recipe comparison between Video-R1 (Feng et al., 2025) and our VIDEO-RTS. While (a) Video-R1 uses two-stage pipeline with SFT and RL, (b) VIDEO-RTS adapts pure-RL approach with output-based rewards for better data efficiency. We further enhance the reasoning of VIDEO-RTS by proposing dynamic sparse-to-dense video test-time scaling. The format reward is omitted, as both models use it. improvements, suggesting that the RL training saturates quickly on video reasoning data. This matches the recent findings in the language domain (Wang et al., 2025c) that very few RL training samples could bring great improvement on reasoning tasks. Thus, inspired by the test-time scaling works (Wang et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023; Snell et al., 2024) in the language community, we aim to enhance the video reasoning capability at the inference stage to better allocate the computational resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically explore the combination of reinforcement learning and test-time inference strategies for improving video reasoning capability. To better allocate the excessive training computation, we propose sparse-to-dense test-time scaling mechanism specifically designed for video reasoning. Specifically, VIDEO-RTS adaptively selects the appropriate temporal context based on output consistency by iteratively adding more frames at the inference stage. Taking advantage of the pureRL training, the model is able to generate diverse deep reasoning process given the challenging video query, which allows us to utilize self-consistency check to decide whether the model obtains sufficient temporal context. The combination of efficient training and adaptive inference enables the model to adapt its computational effort based on the complexity of each input query, producing accurate responses while using only the necessary amount of resources. We evaluate VIDEO-RTS on the five popular video reasoning benchmarks, including VideoHolmes(Cheng et al., 2025), Video-MMMU (Hu et al., 2025), MMVU (Zhao et al., 2025), VideoMME (Fu et al., 2024a) and LongVideoBench (Wu et al., 2024). Results show that across all benchmarks, compared to the recent Video-R1 model (Feng et al., 2025) which trained on 169K samples, VIDEO-RTS, trained with only 6K samples (i.e., 96.4% lesser samples), outperforms by 2.4% in average accuracy while using fewer frames during inference. Specifically, on Video-Holmes, "

PERK, a scalable approach using parameter-efficient adapters, enhances long-context reasoning by encoding contexts into a lightweight model at test time, achieving significant performance improvements over prompt-based methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive, preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline, achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models (GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.

Он кодирует контексты в легковесную модель во время тестирования, достигая значительных улучшений производительности по сравнению с методами на основе промптов. PERK использует два вложенных цикла оптимизации: внутренний кодирует контексты в адаптер LoRA, а внешний учится использовать обновленный адаптер для точного восстановления и рассуждения. Эксперименты показывают, что PERK значительно превосходит стандартные базовые линии для длинного контекста, демонстрируя большую устойчивость к сложности рассуждений и экстраполяции длины.",
