Text:"MITIGATING ATTENTION SINKS AND MASSIVE ACTIVATIONS IN AUDIO-VISUAL SPEECH RECOGNITION WITH LLMS Anand Umberto Cappellazzo Stavros Petridis Maja Pantic University of British Columbia, Canada Imperial College London, UK 5 2 0 2 6 2 ] . e [ 1 3 0 6 2 2 . 0 1 5 2 : r ABSTRACT Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced auditory speech recognition (ASR), visual speech recognition (VSR), and audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR). However, understanding of their internal dynamics under fine-tuning remains limited. In natural language processing, recent work has revealed attention sinks, tokens that attract disproportionately high attention, and associated massive activations in which some features of sink tokens exhibit huge activation in LLMs. In this work, we are the first to study these phenomena in multimodal speech recognition. Through detailed analysis of audio-visual LLMs, we identify attention sinks and massive activations not only at the BOS token but also at intermediate low-semantic tokens across ASR, VSR, and AVSR. We show that massive activations originate in the MLP layers and correspond to fixed feature indices across all sink tokens. We further show that intermediate sink tokens exhibit high cosine similarity to the BOS token, thereby amplifying attention and activation. Building on these insights, we introduce simple decorrelation loss that reduces cosine similarity between BOS and other tokens, effectively mitigating intermediate sinks and massive activations. Furthermore, our method improves word error rate (WER) under high audio-visual feature downsampling while remaining stable at lower downsampling rates. Index Terms Audio-Visual Speech Recognition, Attention Sinks, Massive Activations, Large Language Models 1. INTRODUCTION Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability to adapt to new domains through parameter-efficient finetuning [17]. Recent works demonstrate their effectiveness in Auditory Speech Recognition (ASR),"

Attention sinks and massive activations in multimodal speech recognition are identified and mitigated using a decorrelation loss, improving word error rate under high feature downsampling.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced auditory speech recognition (ASR), visual speech recognition (VSR), and audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR). However, understanding of their internal dynamics under fine-tuning remains limited. In natural language processing, recent work has revealed attention sinks, tokens that attract disproportionately high attention, and associated massive activations in which some features of sink tokens exhibit huge activation in LLMs. In this work, we are the first to study these phenomena in multimodal speech recognition. Through a detailed analysis of audio-visual LLMs, we identify attention sinks and massive activations not only at the BOS token but also at intermediate low-semantic tokens across ASR, VSR, and AVSR. We show that massive activations originate in the MLP layers and correspond to fixed feature indices across all sink tokens. We further show that intermediate sink tokens exhibit high cosine similarity to the BOS token, thereby amplifying attention and activation. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple decorrelation loss that reduces cosine similarity between BOS and other tokens, effectively mitigating intermediate sinks and massive activations. Furthermore, our method improves word error rate (WER) under high audio-visual feature downsampling while remaining stable at lower downsampling rates.

Оказалось, что такие токены-магниты появляются не только в начале последовательности (BOS token), но и среди промежуточных токенов с низкой семантической нагрузкой, причём их активации формируются в MLP слоях. Авторы показали, что промежуточные sink токены имеют высокое косинусное сходство с BOS токеном, что усиливает проблему. Предложенная decorrelation loss снижает это сходство и улучшает word error rate при высоком даунсемплинге аудио-визуальных признаков."
