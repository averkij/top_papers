Text:"ACG: Action Coherence Guidance for Flow-based VLA models Minho Park, Kinam Kim, Junha Hyung, Hyojin Jang, Hoiyeong Jin, Jooyeol Yun, Hojoon Lee, Jaegul Choo KAIST AI 5 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 1 0 2 2 2 . 0 1 5 2 : r Abstract Diffusion and flow matching models have emerged as powerful robot policies, enabling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to generalize across diverse scenes and instructions. Yet, when trained via imitation learning, their high generative capacity makes them sensitive to noise in human demonstrations: jerks, pauses, and jitter which reduce action coherence. Reduced action coherence causes instability and trajectory drift during deployment, failures that are catastrophic in fine-grained manipulation where precision is crucial. In this paper, we present Action Coherence Guidance (ACG) for VLA models, training-free test-time guidance algorithm that improves action coherence and thereby yields performance gains. Evaluated on RoboCasa, DexMimicGen, and real-world SO-101 tasks, ACG consistently improves action coherence and boosts success rates across diverse manipulation tasks. I. INTRODUCTION Diffusion and flow matching models are reshaping how robots learn to manipulate objects [1]. These generative models act as robot policies that directly model complex action distributions from human demonstrations, enabling strong generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. This paradigm has been further extended to Vision-LanguageAction (VLA) models, enabling generalization across wide range of scenes and language instructions [2][5]. Despite these advances, diffusion and flow matching policies trained via imitation learning remain highly sensitive to noise in human demonstrations, such as pauses, jerks, or jitter [6][9]. Their large generative capacity often memorizes these imperfections, which degrades action coherence of the learned policies [10], [11]. Formally, action coherence denotes the smoothness and consistency of successive actions, which can be mea"

To address the above challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, step toward generalist omni-modal reward modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation: We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with freeform preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image, video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, multimodal preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

However, most existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scenelevel understanding, often overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper, we present PixelRefer, unified region-level MLLM framework that enables advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields lightweight Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, high-quality object-centric instruction dataset. Extensive experiments across range of benchmarks validate that PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

Text:"LIMRANK: Less is More for Reasoning-Intensive Information Reranking Tingyu Song Yilun Zhao5 2 0 2 7 2 ] . [ 1 4 4 5 3 2 . 0 1 5 2 : r aExisting approaches typically rely on largescale fine-tuning to adapt LLMs for information reranking tasks, which is computationally expensive. In this work, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only minimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, reusable and open-source pipeline for generating diverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic data, we finetune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two challenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and FOLLOWIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5% of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive problem solving. SighingSnow/LimRank Figure 1: (Top) An illustration of reasoning-intensive reranking scenarios that demand more than surface-level semantic matching. These tasks require multi-step inference, contextual reasoning, and recognition of implicit relationships between queries and documents. (Bottom) An overview of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, which generates high-quality training data for reranking tasks.Recent studies have increasingly leveraged LLMs for reranking tasks in information retrieval (Peng et al., 2025; Zhuang et al., 2025). While LLMs have shown effectiveness in general-purpose reranking scenarios, emerging research reveals notable limitations when these models are applied to reasoning-intensive retrieval settings (Zhang et al., 2025b; Weller et al., 2025b; Shao et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025b; Zhang et al., 2025a). These limitations extend beyond performance metrics. They arise from the inherent challenges LLMs encounter when relevance depends on more than surface-level Equal Contributions. Correspondence: Yilun Zhao (yilun.zhao@yale.edu). keyword matching or shallow semantic similarity. In such scenarios, effective retrieval requires multistep inference, contextual reasoning, and the ability to recognize implicit relationships between queries and documents (Su et al., 2024). Inspired by the growing success of reasoning LLMs (Jaech et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025), several recent studies (Weller et al., 2025b; Zhuang et al., 2025; Yan et al., 2025) have begun exploring the training of LLMs that can leverage test-time computation to improve performance in reasoningintensive retrieval tasks. However, contemporary approaches typically rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning. For instance, Rank1 (Weller et al., 2025b) is fine-tuned on over nearly 700K examples of DeepSeek-R1s reasoning traces, which is expensive in terms of compute and data. used by RANK1, Promptriever, and ReasonIR. We hypothesize that frontier LLMs already possess considerable latent reasoning capabilities for reranking, and that these capabilities can be activated and steered using small number of carefully curated, high-quality examples that encourage extended deliberation. This less is more approach has shown promise in other domains: for example, LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023) and LIMO (Ye et al., 2025) achieve strong performance in instruction following and complex reasoning with minimal but strategically selected examples, demonstrating that carefully curated demonstrations can effectively steer pretrained models without the need for massive fine-tuning. To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate this paradigm in reranking tasks. We introduce LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, modular and open-source pipeline for generating highquality reranking training data through several novel design choices. LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER is guided by three core principles: domain diversity, alignment with real-world use cases, and difficulty diversity. It generates retrieval queries paired with corresponding positive and negative passages, and employs frontier reasoning models (i.e., DeepSeekR1) to produce multi-step reasoning traces. We then apply LLM-based filtering to discard lowquality traces. Using LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, we generate compact yet effective dataset of 20K examplesonly 2.85% of the data used in Rank1. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-7B on this dataset to produce our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two challenging reranking tasks: (1) reasoning-intensive retrieval using BRIGHT (Su et al., 2024), and (2) instructionfollowing retrieval using FOLLOWIR (Weller et al., 2025a). LIMRANK achieves the nDCG@10 score of 28.0% on BRIGHT and p-MRR score of 1.2 on FOLLOWIR, representing the best performance among models with 7B-level parameters. To better understand the strengths and limitations of LIMRANK, we conduct an in-depth human evaluation, revealing that LIMRANK excels particularly in settings that require multi-hop reasoning, subtle instruction disambiguation, and context-sensitive reranking. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation studies on LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and show that each component of our guidelines is essential. We also train different model variants using synthetic IR datasets of the same size (i.e., 20K). Models trained with our data consistently outperform those trained with other synthetic IR datasets To assess LIMRANKs practical utility, we further deploy and evaluate it in two real-worldinspired tasks: (1) Scientific Literature Search on the LitSearch dataset (Ajith et al., 2024), and (2) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on the GPQA benchmark (Rein et al., 2024). Compared to the previous state-of-the-art, Rank1-7B, LIMRANK demonstrates strong generalization, achieving 30.3% accuracy on GPQA (vs. 28.3%) and competitive 60.1% Recall@5 on LitSearch (vs. 60.8%), demonstrating its effectiveness as plug-in reranker in real-world systems.Reasoning-intensive Information Retrieval (Su et al., 2024) has gained increasing attention due to its practical relevance in real-world scenarios. Some works, such as RANK1 (Weller et al., 2025b) and ReasonIR (Shao et al., 2025), address this challenge by fine-tuning models on large-scale, reasoning-focused retrieval datasets to enhance the performance of rerankers and retrievers, respectively.

We present Lanser-CLI, CLI-first orchestration layer that pins and mediates Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for coding agents and CI, exposing deterministic, replayable workflows. Our position is that language servers provide not only structural information (definitions, references, types, diagnostics) but also an actionable process reward : machine-checked, step-wise signals that align an agents planning loop with program reality. In this work, Lanser-CLI contributes: (i) robust addressing scheme beyond brittle file:line:col via Selector DSL (symbolic, AST-path, and content-anchored selectors) with principled relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles that normalize Language Server responses and capture environment/capability metadata with stable content hashes; (iii) safety envelope for mutating operations (rename, code actions) with preview, workspace jails, and Git-aware, transactional apply; and (iv) process-reward functional derived from Language Server facts (diagnostic deltas, disambiguation confidence, and safe-apply checks) that is computable online and replayable offline.

We introduce PRISM-Bench, benchmark of puzzle-based visual challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces diagnostic task: given visual puzzle and step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error, models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric, and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal persistent gap between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers sharper lens on multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs. Code: https://github.com/JornyWan/PRISM-Bench Date: October 28, Multimodal reasoning is central to human cognition.

Recently, matrix-based preconditioned optimization methods, such as Shampoo (Gupta et al., 2018), SOAP (Vyas et al., 2024) and Muon (Jordan et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025), have been introduced to speed up the training of large models like Kimi K2 (Team et al., 2025) and GLM-4.5 (Z.ai, 2025). Unlike vector-based methods, matrix-based approaches operate directly on the model parameter matrices without flattening them, thereby preserving their inherent 2D structure and the underlying optimization geometry. On the other hand, stochastic optimization methods are often hindered by high variance in the stochastic gradients during training, which can slow convergence and degrade stability. To address this issue, numerous variance reduction techniques have been proposed, including SAG (Roux et al., 2012), SVRG (Johnson and Zhang, 2013), SARAH (Nguyen et al., 2017a,b), SPIDER (Fang et al., 2018), SNVRG (Zhou et al., 2020) and STORM (Cutkosky and Orabona, 2019), to mention few. Equal contribution Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA; email: liuyifeng@cs.ucla.edu Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA; email: hzyuan@cs.ucla.edu Corresponding Author, Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA; email: qgu@cs.ucla.edu 1 However, these methods have seen limited success in training large-scale deep neural networks, largely due to incompatibilities with the practice of deep learning and neural network architectures (Defazio and Bottou, 2019). To make variance reduction work for training large-scale deep neural networks and LLMs, MARS (Yuan et al., 2025) was recently proposed. It introduces scaling parameter into the STORM optimizer (Cutkosky and Orabona, 2019), effectively resolving the incompatibility of variance-reduction techniques with preconditioned optimization methods, which have demonstrated superior performance in both language modeling and computer vision tasks. It is also worth noting that similar scaling idea has also been proposed for SVRG in Yin et al. (2024). In fact, the recent benchmarks of optimizers for LLM pretraining (Wen et al., 2025; Semenov et al., 2025) have empirically demonstrated that matrix-based optimizers (e.g., Shampoo, SOAP and Muon) outperform scalar-based optimizers (e.g., AdamW and Lion), and variance-reduction approaches (e.g., MARS, NadamW (Dozat, 2016)) also yield additional, discernible speedup. Therefore, natural question arises: Can we achieve the best of both worlds by combining matrix-based optimizers with variance reduction such as MARS? It is worth mentioning that in the original MARS work (Yuan et al., 2025), the authors have already proposed MARS-shampoo, which attempts to combine matrix-based optimizer with variance reduction. However, MARS-shampoo displays performances inferior to vector-based variants like MARS-AdamW, leaving open the question of whether variance reduction can be effectively integrated with matrix-based optimizers. In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to this question by introducing MARS-M, matrix-based MARS optimizer that integrates variance reduction with the Moonlight version (Liu et al., 2025) of Muon. Additionally, we also propose the approximated version of MARS-M as practical variant, which is also the bridge between variance reduction techniques and traditional preconditioned optimizers. In summary, our contributions are highlighted as follows: We propose MARS-M, an instantiation of MARS tailored to the Moonlight optimizer. In addition, we develop an approximate version of MARS-M to further accelerate training. We show the connections and differences between MARS-M and MARS-Shampoo. We also show that the approximate version of MARS-M can be seen as variant of Moonlight with adjusted momentum parameters. We further provide convergence analysis of MARS-M, and show that it attains convergence rate of (cid:101)O(T 1/3), which surpasses the previously established O(T 1/4) rate achieved by Muon (Li and Hong, 2025; Shen et al., 2025; Pethick et al., 2025). Empirically, we evaluate the performances of MARS-M as well as Muon (Moonlight) optimizer for training GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) series models on OpenWebText and FineWeb-Edu 100B datasets. The experiment results show that MARS-M can manifest stable improvement on training and validation losses. Moreover, on downstream tasks, MARS-M can also achieve better performances on benchmarks such as Hellaswag (Zellers et al., 2019) and SciQ (Johannes Welbl, 2017) than baseline optimizers. Additionally, MARS-M can also achieve better test accuracy than AdamW and Muon on computer vision tasks. Notation We use bold capital letters X, Y, to denote matrices. For matrix Rmn, we j=1 Wij to denote its Frobenius norm. In this paper,"

VITA-E, a dual-model embodied interaction framework, enables concurrent and interruptible vision-language-action capabilities, enhancing real-time user interaction and multitasking.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are often constrained by a rigid, static interaction paradigm, which lacks the ability to see, hear, speak, and act concurrently as well as handle real-time user interruptions dynamically. This hinders seamless embodied collaboration, resulting in an inflexible and unresponsive user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce VITA-E, a novel embodied interaction framework designed for both behavioral concurrency and nearly real-time interruption. The core of our approach is a dual-model architecture where two parallel VLA instances operate as an ``Active Model'' and a ``Standby Model'', allowing the embodied agent to observe its environment, listen to user speech, provide verbal responses, and execute actions, all concurrently and interruptibly, mimicking human-like multitasking capabilities. We further propose a ``model-as-controller'' paradigm, where we fine-tune the VLM to generate special tokens that serve as direct system-level commands, coupling the model's reasoning with the system's behavior. Experiments conducted on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that VITA-E can reliably handle complex interactive scenarios. Our framework is compatible with various dual-system VLA models, achieving an extremely high success rate on emergency stops and speech interruptions while also successfully performing concurrent speech and action. This represents a significant step towards more natural and capable embodied assistants.

Action Coherence Guidance (ACG) improves action coherence in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models during test time, enhancing performance in diverse manipulation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion and flow matching models have emerged as powerful robot policies, enabling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to generalize across diverse scenes and instructions. Yet, when trained via imitation learning, their high generative capacity makes them sensitive to noise in human demonstrations: jerks, pauses, and jitter which reduce action coherence. Reduced action coherence causes instability and trajectory drift during deployment, failures that are catastrophic in fine-grained manipulation where precision is crucial. In this paper, we present Action Coherence Guidance (ACG) for VLA models, a training-free test-time guidance algorithm that improves action coherence and thereby yields performance gains. Evaluated on RoboCasa, DexMimicGen, and real-world SO-101 tasks, ACG consistently improves action coherence and boosts success rates across diverse manipulation tasks.

Concerto, a minimalist model combining 3D self-distillation and 2D-3D joint embedding, achieves superior spatial feature learning and outperforms existing models in scene understanding and open-world perception.  					AI-generated summary 				 Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed, such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with 2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation, in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7% mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

Omni-Reward addresses modality imbalance and preference rigidity in reward models by introducing a benchmark, dataset, and model that support multiple modalities and free-form preferences.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance, where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation: We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image, video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

PixelRefer is a unified region-level MLLM framework that enhances fine-grained object-centric understanding using a Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer and Object-Centric Infusion module, achieving high performance and efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper, we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER generates synthetic data to fine-tune LIMRANK, achieving competitive performance with minimal supervision on information reranking tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing approaches typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning to adapt LLMs for information reranking tasks, which is computationally expensive. In this work, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only minimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a reusable and open-source pipeline for generating diverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic data, we fine-tune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two challenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and FollowIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5% of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive problem solving.

Our experiments demonstrate that LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5% of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive problem solving."

A unified framework extends a single text embedding model to perform both retrieval and listwise reranking, achieving state-of-the-art results with low latency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space, they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However, their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers, especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective unified framework E^2Rank, means Efficient Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective, thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically, E^2Rank achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.

Lanser-CLI orchestrates Language Server Protocol servers for coding agents and CI, providing deterministic workflows and actionable process rewards based on verified code facts.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models routinely hallucinate APIs and mislocalize edits, while language servers compute verified, IDE-grade facts about real code. We present Lanser-CLI, a CLI-first orchestration layer that pins and mediates a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for coding agents and CI, exposing deterministic, replayable workflows. Our position is that language servers provide not only structural information (definitions, references, types, diagnostics) but also an actionable process reward: machine-checked, step-wise signals that align an agent's planning loop with program reality. In this work, Lanser-CLI contributes: (i) a robust addressing scheme beyond brittle "file:line:col" via a Selector DSL (symbolic, AST-path, and content-anchored selectors) with a principled relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles that normalize Language Server responses and capture environment/capability metadata with stable content hashes; (iii) a safety envelope for mutating operations (rename, code actions) with preview, workspace jails, and Git-aware, transactional apply; and (iv) a process-reward functional derived from Language Server facts (diagnostic deltas, disambiguation confidence, and safe-apply checks) that is computable online and replayable offline. We formalize determinism under frozen snapshots and establish a monotonicity property for the process reward, making it suitable for process supervision and counterfactual analysis.

A new method, Distilled Decoding 2 (DD2), enables one-step sampling for image auto-regressive models with minimal performance degradation and significant speed-up compared to previous methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required. Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token position. Based on this, we propose a novel conditional score distillation loss to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256. Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3times training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at https://github.com/imagination-research/Distilled-Decoding-2.

"A new method, Distilled Decoding 2 (DD2), enables one-step sampling for image auto-regressive models with minimal performance degradation and significant speed-up compared to previous methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required. Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token position. Based on this, we propose a novel conditional score distillation loss to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256. Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3times training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and high-quality AR modeling.

PRISM-Bench evaluates models' reasoning processes by identifying errors in step-by-step solutions to visual puzzles, highlighting gaps between fluent generation and logical consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce PRISM-Bench, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error, models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric, and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

A new benchmarking framework uses large-scale simulated environments with human feedback to evaluate robot policies, addressing limitations in real-world testing and existing simulation benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing diverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable evaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments. As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify, since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts. Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup, resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's robotics landscape.

A unified multimodal model achieves competitive performance with efficient fusion of generation and understanding models, using interleaved multimodal self-attention blocks and minimal training resources.  					AI-generated summary 				 Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either generation or understanding.

MARS-M, a new optimizer combining Muon and MARS techniques, achieves faster convergence and better performance in large-scale neural network training.  					AI-generated summary 				 Matrix-based preconditioned optimizers, such as Muon, have recently been shown to be more efficient than scalar-based optimizers for training large-scale neural networks, including large language models (LLMs). On the other hand, recent benchmarks on optimizers for LLM pre-training have demonstrated that variance-reduction techniques such as MARS can achieve substantial speedups over standard optimizers that do not employ variance reduction. In this paper, to achieve the best of both worlds, we introduce MARS-M, a new optimizer that integrates the variance reduction technique in MARS with Muon. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove that Muon-M converges to a first-order stationary point at a rate of mathcal{O}(T^{-1/3}), which improves upon mathcal{O}(T^{-1/4}) rate attained by Muon. Our empirical results on language modeling and computer vision tasks demonstrate that MARS-M consistently yields lower losses and improved performance across various downstream benchmarks. The implementation of MARS-M is available at https://github.com/AGI-Arena/MARS/MARS_M.
