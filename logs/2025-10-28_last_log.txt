Text:"DiffusionLane: Diffusion Model for Lane Detection Kunyang Zhou1,2,Yeqin Shao1* 1School of ZhangJian, Nantong University 2School of Automation, Southeast University {kunyangzhou@seu.edu.cn, hnsyk@ntu.edu.cn} 5 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 6 3 2 2 2 . 0 1 5 2 : r Abstract In this paper, we present novel diffusion-based model for lane detection, called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as denoising diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the noisy lane anchors in progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly, we propose hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors. Specifically, we design hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane, Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses strong generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18 surpasses the existing methods by at least 1% accuracy on the domain adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets 81.32% F1 score on CULane, 96.89% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and 97.59% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101. Code will be available at https://github.com/zkyntu/UnLanedet. Introduction Lane detection is fundamental task in computer vision and autonomous driving, playing crucial role in adaptive cruise control and lane keeping. It aims to predict the location of lanes in the given image. Existing lane detection"

DiffusionLane, a diffusion-based model, enhances lane detection by refining noisy lane anchors through a hybrid diffusion decoder and auxiliary head, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection, called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly, we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors. Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane, Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18 surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets 81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and 97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101. Code will be available at https://github.com/zkyntu/UnLanedet.
