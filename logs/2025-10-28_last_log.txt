Text:"5 2 0 2 8 1 ] . [ 1 0 2 3 6 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r a Wenhao Wang1, Longqi Cai2, Taihong Xiao2, Yuxiao Wang2 and Ming-Hsuan Yang2 1University of Technology Sydney, 2Google DeepMind 2025-10-21 This paper presents systematic study of scaling laws for the deepfake detection task. Specifically, we analyze the model performance against the number of real image domains, deepfake generation methods, and training images. Since no existing dataset meets the scale requirements for this research, we construct ScaleDF, the largest dataset to date in this field, which contains over 5.8 million real images from 51 different datasets (domains) and more than 8.8 million fake images generated by 102 deepfake methods. Using ScaleDF, we observe power-law scaling similar to that shown in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the average detection error follows predictable power-law decay as either the number of real domains or the number of deepfake methods increases. This key observation not only allows us to forecast the number of additional real domains or deepfake methods required to reach target performance, but also inspires us to counter the evolving deepfake technology in data-centric manner. Beyond this, we examine the role of pre-training and data augmentations in deepfake detection under scaling, as well as the limitations of scaling itself. Keywords: scaling law, deepfake detection, large-scale dataset 1. Introduction The rapid advancement of deepfake technology poses significant challenges to society, ranging from the dissemination of misinformation to the infringement of personal privacy, thereby necessitating the development of effective detection methods. Within the ongoing arms race" between generation and detection, central challenge lies in how detection models can generalize to the ever-emerging new forms of forgeries. Increasing the diversity of training data at scale has been considered promising approach to address this issue. However, this raises fundamental quest"

Research on scaling laws in deepfake detection using the largest dataset to date reveals power-law scaling similar to large language models, enabling performance forecasting and data-centric countermeasures against evolving deepfake technology.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents a systematic study of scaling laws for the deepfake detection task. Specifically, we analyze the model performance against the number of real image domains, deepfake generation methods, and training images. Since no existing dataset meets the scale requirements for this research, we construct ScaleDF, the largest dataset to date in this field, which contains over 5.8 million real images from 51 different datasets (domains) and more than 8.8 million fake images generated by 102 deepfake methods. Using ScaleDF, we observe power-law scaling similar to that shown in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the average detection error follows a predictable power-law decay as either the number of real domains or the number of deepfake methods increases. This key observation not only allows us to forecast the number of additional real domains or deepfake methods required to reach a target performance, but also inspires us to counter the evolving deepfake technology in a data-centric manner. Beyond this, we examine the role of pre-training and data augmentations in deepfake detection under scaling, as well as the limitations of scaling itself.

Они обнаружили степенной закон масштабирования, аналогичный тому, что наблюдается в LLM: ошибка детекции предсказуемо уменьшается при увеличении количества реальных доменов или методов генерации дипфейков. Это позволяет прогнозировать, сколько дополнительных данных потребуется для достижения целевой точности, и предлагает data-centric подход к борьбе с развивающимися технологиями дипфейков. Также исследованы роль предобучения, аугментаций данных и ограничения самого масштабирования в контексте детекции дипфейков.",

SyncHuman combines 2D multiview and 3D native generative models with pixel-aligned synchronization and feature injection to achieve high-quality, photorealistic 3D human reconstruction from single images.  					AI-generated summary 				 Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses. Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.
