There is a significant gap between patient needs and available mental health support today. In this paper, we aim to thoroughly examine the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist professional psychotherapy. To this end, we propose a new benchmark, CBT-BENCH, for the systematic evaluation of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) assistance. We include three levels of tasks in CBT-BENCH: I: Basic CBT knowledge acquisition, with the task of multiple-choice questions; II: Cognitive model understanding, with the tasks of cognitive distortion classification, primary core belief classification, and fine-grained core belief classification; III: Therapeutic response generation, with the task of generating responses to patient speech in CBT therapy sessions. These tasks encompass key aspects of CBT that could potentially be enhanced through AI assistance, while also outlining a hierarchy of capability requirements, ranging from basic knowledge recitation to engaging in real therapeutic conversations. We evaluated representative LLMs on our benchmark. Experimental results indicate that while LLMs perform well in reciting CBT knowledge, they fall short in complex real-world scenarios requiring deep analysis of patients' cognitive structures and generating effective responses, suggesting potential future work.

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is crucial in adapting large language models (LLMs) to a specific domain or task. However, only a limited amount of labeled data is available in practical applications, which poses a severe challenge for SFT in yielding satisfactory results. Therefore, a data-efficient framework that can fully exploit labeled and unlabeled data for LLM fine-tuning is highly anticipated. Towards this end, we introduce a semi-supervised fine-tuning framework named SemiEvol for LLM adaptation from a propagate-and-select manner. For knowledge propagation, SemiEvol adopts a bi-level approach, propagating knowledge from labeled data to unlabeled data through both in-weight and in-context methods. For knowledge selection, SemiEvol incorporates a collaborative learning mechanism, selecting higher-quality pseudo-response samples. We conducted experiments using GPT-4o-mini and Llama-3.1 on seven general or domain-specific datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in model performance on target data. Furthermore, we compared SemiEvol with SFT and self-evolution methods, highlighting its practicality in hybrid data scenarios.
