[ 1 3 4 2 4 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r 2026-1-21 Jet-RL: Enabling On-Policy FP8 Reinforcement Learning with Unified Training and Rollout Precision Flow Haocheng Xi1,3 Charlie Ruan3 Peiyuan Liao4 Yujun Lin1 Han Cai1 Yilong Zhao3 Shuo Yang3 Kurt Keutzer3 Song Han1,2 Ligeng Zhu1, 1NVIDIA 2MIT 3UC Berkeley 4Stanford University Reinforcement learning (RL) is essential for enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, RL training pipelines are computationally inefficient and resource-intensive, with the rollout phase consuming over 70% of the total training time. Quantized RL training, particularly with FP8, offers promising solution. For example, common approach is to employ FP8 precision during rollout to alleviate this bottleneck while retaining BF16 precision during training. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of FP8 RL training and show that the commonly adopted BF16-train + FP8-rollout strategy suffers from severe training instability and catastrophic accuracy collapse under long-rollout generation and challenging tasks. Our analysis reveals that these issues arise from the off-policy nature of the approach, which introduces significant numerical mismatch between training and inference. Motivated by these findings, we propose Jet-RL, FP8 RL training framework that enables robust and stable RL training. The key idea is to adopt an unified FP8 precision flow for both training and rollout, minimizing numerical discrepancies and avoiding the need for inefficient inter-step calibration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Jet-RL. Our method achieves up to 33% rollout phase speedup, up to 41% training phase speedup, and 16% end-to-end speedup over BF16 training while maintaining robust convergence across all settings and exhibiting negligible accuracy degradation. We will release our code and pre-trained models when less anoynomous. Figure 1 Overview of RL training different between JetRL"
