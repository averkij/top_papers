Text:"Compressed Chain of Thought: Efficient Reasoning through Dense Representations Jeffrey Cheng 1 Benjamin Van Durme 1 4 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 1 7 1 3 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r Abstract Chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding enables language models to improve reasoning performance at the cost of high generation latency in decoding. Recent proposals have explored variants of contemplation tokens, term we introduce that refers to special tokens used during inference to allow for extra computation. Prior work has considered fixed-length sequences drawn from discrete set of embeddings as contemplation tokens. Here we propose Compressed Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), framework to generate contentful and continuous contemplation tokens of variable sequence length. The generated contemplation tokens are compressed representations of explicit reasoning chains, and our method can be applied to off-theshelf decoder language models. Through experiments, we illustrate how CCoT enables additional reasoning over dense contentful representations to achieve corresponding improvements in accuracy. Moreover, the reasoning improvements can be adaptively modified on demand by controlling the number of contemplation tokens generated. 1. Introduction Chain-of-Thought (CoT) refers to the Large Language Model (LLM) technique in which the model simulates the process of thinking out loud by decomposing complex question into parts and sequentially reasoning through each step. This behavior can be induced by finetuning on dataset or human feedback (Liu et al., 2023; Puerto et al., 2024), demonstrating through ICL (Wei et al., 2023), or by providing tuned model instructions (Kojima et al., 2023). While CoT improves the reasoning capabilities of LLMs on variety of tasks, the improvements come at the cost of high generation latency. For instance, GPT-4o takes 21.37 seconds to generate response to the question shown in Fig1Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins UniJeffrey Cheng versity, Baltimore, US. Correspondence to:"

Recent works on accelerating Vision-Language Models show that strong performance can be maintained across a variety of vision-language tasks despite highly compressing visual information. In this work, we examine the popular acceleration approach of early pruning of visual tokens inside the language model and find that its strong performance across many tasks is not due to an exceptional ability to compress visual information, but rather the benchmarks' limited ability to assess fine-grained visual capabilities. Namely, we demonstrate a core issue with the acceleration approach where most tokens towards the top of the image are pruned away. Yet, this issue is only reflected in performance for a small subset of tasks such as localization. For the other evaluated tasks, strong performance is maintained with the flawed pruning strategy. Noting the limited visual capabilities of the studied acceleration technique, we propose FEATHER (Fast and Effective Acceleration wiTH Ensemble cRiteria), a straightforward approach that (1) resolves the identified issue with early-layer pruning, (2) incorporates uniform sampling to ensure coverage across all image regions, and (3) applies pruning in two stages to allow the criteria to become more effective at a later layer while still achieving significant speedup through early-layer pruning. With comparable computational savings, we find that FEATHER has more than 5times performance improvement on the vision-centric localization benchmarks compared to the original acceleration approach.

In real world software development, improper or missing exception handling can severely impact the robustness and reliability of code. Exception handling mechanisms require developers to detect, capture, and manage exceptions according to high standards, but many developers struggle with these tasks, leading to fragile code. This problem is particularly evident in open-source projects and impacts the overall quality of the software ecosystem. To address this challenge, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to improve exception handling in code. Through extensive analysis, we identify three key issues: Insensitive Detection of Fragile Code, Inaccurate Capture of Exception Block, and Distorted Handling Solution. These problems are widespread across real world repositories, suggesting that robust exception handling practices are often overlooked or mishandled. In response, we propose Seeker, a multi-agent framework inspired by expert developer strategies for exception handling. Seeker uses agents: Scanner, Detector, Predator, Ranker, and Handler to assist LLMs in detecting, capturing, and resolving exceptions more effectively. Our work is the first systematic study on leveraging LLMs to enhance exception handling practices in real development scenarios, providing valuable insights for future improvements in code reliability.
