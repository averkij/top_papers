Text:"SageAttention2++: More Efficient Implementation of SageAttention2 Jintao Zhang 1 Xiaoming Xu 1 Jia Wei 1 Haofeng Huang 1 Pengle Zhang 1 Chendong Xiang 1 Jun Zhu 1 Jianfei Chen 1 5 2 0 2 8 2 ] . [ 2 6 3 1 1 2 . 5 0 5 2 : r aThe efficiency of attention is critical because its time complexity grows quadratically with sequence length. SageAttention2 addresses this by using quantization to speed up matrix multiplications (Matmul) in attention. To further accelerate SageAttention2, we propose to utilize the faster instruction of FP8 Matmul accumulated in FP16. The instruction is 2 faster than the FP8 Matmul used in SageAttention2. Our experiments show that SageAttention2++ achieves 3.9 speedup over FlashAttention while maintaining the same attention accuracy as SageAttention2. This means SageAttention2++ effectively accelerates various models, including those for language, image, and video generation, with negligible end-to-end metrics loss. The code will be available at https://github.com/ thu-ml/SageAttention. 1. Introduction The quadratic time complexity of attention necessitates efficient implementations for real-world applications with long sequences (Jiang et al., 2024). Current approaches to reduce attentions computational demands fall into three main categories: (1) linear attention methods (Wang et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024) that achieve O(N ) complexity, and (2) sparse attention techniques (Liu et al., 2021; Chu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2024b;a; Chen et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024; Venkataramanan et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025e; Xi et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025f) that process only relevant context portions. While effective, these methods often exhibit limited generality across models and tasks. (3) An alternative direction focuses on hardware-optimized attention implementations that maintain full sequence computation while achieving superior speed and accuracy. No1Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University. Preprint. table examples include FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022), FlashAttention2 (Dao, 2024; Shah et al., 2024), xFormers (Lefaudeux et al., 2022), and SageAttentions (Zhang et al., 2025c;c;d;b) which demonstrate strong performance across diverse applications. Motivation, problem, and our approach. For the second matrix multiplication (Matmul) in attention, SageAttention2 accelerates it by quantizing to FP8 and using the mma.f32.f8.f8.f32 instruction. However, mma.f32.f8.f8.f32 employs an FP32 accumulator and is only 2 faster than FP16. We find that the mma.f16.f8.f8.f16 instruction (using FP16 accumulator for FP8 Matmul) achieves 4 speedup over FP16 (NVIDIA, 2022). Therefore, we aim to accelerate SageAttention2 by using the faster instruction. However, directly using the faster instruction will lead to the values of exceeding the representable range of FP16. To address the problem, we propose to narrow the quantization range of and to satisfy the accumulator range in FP16. Performance. For efficiency, SageAttention2++ delivers 3.9 speedup over FlashAttention. In terms of accuracy, SageAttention2++ matches SageAttention2s performance. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on state-of-the-art models for text, image, and video generation. The results demonstrate that SageAttention2++ provides plug-and-play acceleration with negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models. 2. Preliminary Table 1.

For simplicity, we omit the subscripts ({Qi}, {Ki}, { (cid:101)Pi}, {Vi}) in the following content and use Q, K, (cid:101)P , to represent the tiled blocks. SageAttention2 quantizes Q, to INT4/INT8 with per-block granularity, (cid:101)P to FP8 in E4M3 with per-block granularity, and quantizes to FP8 in E4M3 with per-channel granularity. This means each Q, K, (cid:101)P has separate scale factor: δQ = max(Q)/127, δK = max(K)/127, δP = max( (cid:101)P )/448, and each channel of has separate scalar scale: δV = colmax(V )/448. By doing so, SageAttention2 accelerates matrix multiplications in attention through low-bit Tensor Core operations. For example, ˆP = (cid:101)P /δP , ˆV = /δv. Then, = ˆP ˆV δP δV . 2.2. Data Type of Accumulator for Matmul the speed of Matmul instructions deIn some GPUs, pends on the accumulator data type. For instance, mma.f32.f8.f8.f32 uses FP32 accumulator for FP8 Matmul and is only 2 faster than FP16. The instruction using FP16 accumulator for FP8 Matmul (mma.f16.f8.f8.f16) is 4 faster than FP16. Table 1 summarizes the speedup of Matmul instructions with different accumulators. 3. SageAttention2++ In this section, we introduce SageAttention2++. The workflow of SageAttention2++ is based on SageAttention2, also using the smoothing of and K, INT4/INT8 quantization for QK Matmul and FP8 quantization for Matmul. The main difference is that for , SageAttention2++ uses the faster instruction (mma.f16.f8.f8.f16), which employs an FP16 accumulator for the FP8 Matmul. To ensure the results of FP8 Matmul remain within FP16s representable range, we adjust the scale factor of the FP8 quantization. 3.1. Narrowing the FP8 Quantization Range The specific MMA (NVIDIA, 2025) instruction used for the MatMul between and is mma.m16n8k32. If we quantize and to FP8 in E4M3 (-448448) as in SageAt2 tention2, the results may exceed FP16s representable range (-6550465504). This occurs because 32 product values pv are accumulated in FP16, where and come from quantized ˆP and ˆV (derived from (cid:101)P and ). To ensure the accumulated results stay within FP16s range: 32 pv 65504 (1) For instance, choosing 224 and 9 satisfies this condit"

The efficiency of attention is critical because its time complexity grows quadratically with sequence length. SageAttention2 addresses this by utilizing quantization to accelerate matrix multiplications (Matmul) in attention. To further accelerate SageAttention2, we propose to utilize the faster instruction of FP8 Matmul accumulated in FP16. The instruction is 2x faster than the FP8 Matmul used in SageAttention2. Our experiments show that SageAttention2++ achieves a 3.9x speedup over FlashAttention while maintaining the same attention accuracy as SageAttention2. This means SageAttention2++ effectively accelerates various models, including those for language, image, and video generation, with negligible end-to-end metrics loss. The code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.

This paper aims to overcome a major obstacle in scaling RL for reasoning with LLMs, namely the collapse of policy entropy. Such phenomenon is consistently observed across vast RL runs without entropy intervention, where the policy entropy dropped sharply at the early training stage, this diminished exploratory ability is always accompanied with the saturation of policy performance. In practice, we establish a transformation equation R=-a*e^H+b between entropy H and downstream performance R. This empirical law strongly indicates that, the policy performance is traded from policy entropy, thus bottlenecked by its exhaustion, and the ceiling is fully predictable H=0, R=-a+b. Our finding necessitates entropy management for continuous exploration toward scaling compute for RL. To this end, we investigate entropy dynamics both theoretically and empirically. Our derivation highlights that, the change in policy entropy is driven by the covariance between action probability and the change in logits, which is proportional to its advantage when using Policy Gradient-like algorithms. Empirical study shows that, the values of covariance term and entropy differences matched exactly, supporting the theoretical conclusion. Moreover, the covariance term stays mostly positive throughout training, further explaining why policy entropy would decrease monotonically. Through understanding the mechanism behind entropy dynamics, we motivate to control entropy by restricting the update of high-covariance tokens. Specifically, we propose two simple yet effective techniques, namely Clip-Cov and KL-Cov, which clip and apply KL penalty to tokens with high covariances respectively. Experiments show that these methods encourage exploration, thus helping policy escape entropy collapse and achieve better downstream performance.

Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark (GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained (e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex geographic inference. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Thorin215/GRE.

"Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark (GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained (e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex geographic inference. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Thorin215/GRE."

Safe-Sora embeds invisible watermarks into AI-generated videos using a hierarchical adaptive matching mechanism and a 3D wavelet transform-enhanced Mamba architecture, achieving top performance in video quality, watermark fidelity, and robustness.  					AI-generated summary 				 The explosive growth of generative video models has amplified the demand for reliable copyright preservation of AI-generated content. Despite its popularity in image synthesis, invisible generative watermarking remains largely underexplored in video generation. To address this gap, we propose Safe-Sora, the first framework to embed graphical watermarks directly into the video generation process. Motivated by the observation that watermarking performance is closely tied to the visual similarity between the watermark and cover content, we introduce a hierarchical coarse-to-fine adaptive matching mechanism. Specifically, the watermark image is divided into patches, each assigned to the most visually similar video frame, and further localized to the optimal spatial region for seamless embedding. To enable spatiotemporal fusion of watermark patches across video frames, we develop a 3D wavelet transform-enhanced Mamba architecture with a novel spatiotemporal local scanning strategy, effectively modeling long-range dependencies during watermark embedding and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply state space models to watermarking, opening new avenues for efficient and robust watermark protection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Safe-Sora achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of video quality, watermark fidelity, and robustness, which is largely attributed to our proposals. We will release our code upon publication.
