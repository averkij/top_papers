Text:"5 2 0 2 6 2 ] . [ 1 1 1 4 0 2 . 5 0 5 2 : r SWE-rebench: An Automated Pipeline for Task Collection and Decontaminated Evaluation of Software Engineering Agents Ibragim Badertdinov Nebius Alexander Golubev Nebius Maksim Nekrashevich Nebius Anton Shevtsov Nebius Simon Karasik Nebius Andrei Andriushchenko NebiusLLM-based agents have shown promising capabilities in growing range of software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, advancing this field faces two critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these limitations, we introduce novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, public dataset comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to contamination issues.Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in SWE tasks, including code generation, debugging, and automated development workflows. Building on these capabilities, researchers have begun creating LLM-driven agents that interact with real codebases and development environments, performing actions and receiving feedback [Jin et al., 2025]. While frontier proprietary models drive the performance of the most competitive agents (e.g., OpenHands [Wang et al., 2024], Moatless Tools [Antoniades et al., 2024], Agentless [Xia et al., 2024]) on key benchmarks like SWE-bench [Jimenez et al., 2024], there exists significant opportunity to enhance open-source models [Wang, 2025, Yang et al., 2025, Wang et al., 2025, Aggarwal et al., 2025, Ma et al., 2025, Equal contribution. Correspondence to ibragim-bad@nebius.com Preprint. Wei et al., 2025, Golubev et al., 2024]. Progress in this direction, particularly toward complex agentic behaviors, may be accelerated with access to large-scale, high-quality training data that mirrors the interactivity inherent in real-world software development. Existing powerful open-source models like DeepSeek-V3 [DeepSeek-AI, 2024], LLaMa 4 [Meta AI, 2025] and Qwen3 [Team, 2025] could potentially be fine-tuned to achieve comparable performance in specific SWE domains, but this hinges on the availability of suitable interactive task data. Current approaches to training LLMs for programming often rely on code data from open-source repositories [Lozhkov et al., 2024] or synthetic instruction datasets [Wei et al., 2024] that are used for instruction tuning. However, training robust software engineering agents for real-world scenarios necessitates datasets that extend beyond simple code generation. To truly enable learning through methods like Reinforcement Learning (RL), which thrives on trial-and-error, agents require interactive tasks coupled with automatic verification mechanisms. Such data must allow agents to perform diverse actions, observe environment responses after each step, and receive eventual verification outcomes that determine task success. Unlike domains such as mathematics [Shao et al., 2024] or web navigation [Pan et al., 2024a], software engineering has historically lacked such large-scale interactive datasets due to the complexities of configuring diverse, executable environments at scale. While recent efforts like SWE-Gym [Pan et al., 2024b] and SWE-PolyBench [Rashid et al., 2025] represent promising steps, their manual curation processes and reliance on limited number of repositories constrain their scope, diversity, and scalability. Furthermore, the evaluation of rapidly advancing LLM-based agents also faces significant challenges. Static benchmarks, while initially valuable, can become compromised by data contamination as newer models become exposed to test instances during their extensive pre/post-training. Moreover, the lack of standardized evaluation protocols, variability in agent scaffolds and inconsistent reporting practices make direct comparisons between models difficult and can obscure their true capabilities. To address these challenges in both training data availability and evaluation reliability, we present scalable, fully automated pipeline for continuous collection of software engineering tasks from real-world GitHub repositories. Building upon our prior work such as SWE-bench Extra [Badertdinov et al., 2024], which has been well-received by the community and is already used to train open-source software engineering agents [Wang et al., 2025], our approach eliminates manual intervention and significantly expands task diversity and scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system enabling fully automated, scalable collection of executable tasks from wide set of real-world repositories, specifically designed to support interactive agent training and robust benchmarking. Our main contributions are as follows: scalable and fully automated pipeline for mining real-world software engineering tasks from GitHub, covering environment configuration, build setup, and test validation. SWE-rebench2, public dataset of more than 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, designed to train and benchmark agents in diverse executable environments, particularly suitable for reinforcement learning-based approaches. public SWE-rebench leaderboard3 that offers continuously updated, decontaminated, and standardized evaluations for LLM-based agents, promoting transparency and fair comparisons across both openand closed-source models. By focusing on scale and automation, SWE-rebench aims to fill critical gap in the LLM agent ecosystem. We believe it will serve as foundational resource for accelerating"

A novel pipeline extracts real-world, interactive software engineering tasks from GitHub to create SWE-rebench, improving the evaluation of reinforcement learning models in SWE.  					AI-generated summary 				 LLM-based agents have shown promising capabilities in a growing range of software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, advancing this field faces two critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to contamination issues.

JQL systematically curates high-quality multilingual training data using pretrained multilingual embeddings, outperforming heuristic methods and improving downstream model training across diverse languages.  					AI-generated summary 				 High-quality multilingual training data is essential for effectively pretraining large language models (LLMs). Yet, the availability of suitable open-source multilingual datasets remains limited. Existing state-of-the-art datasets mostly rely on heuristic filtering methods, restricting both their cross-lingual transferability and scalability. Here, we introduce JQL, a systematic approach that efficiently curates diverse and high-quality multilingual data at scale while significantly reducing computational demands. JQL distills LLMs' annotation capabilities into lightweight annotators based on pretrained multilingual embeddings. These models exhibit robust multilingual and cross-lingual performance, even for languages and scripts unseen during training. Evaluated empirically across 35 languages, the resulting annotation pipeline substantially outperforms current heuristic filtering methods like Fineweb2. JQL notably enhances downstream model training quality and increases data retention rates. Our research provides practical insights and valuable resources for multilingual data curation, raising the standards of multilingual dataset development.

A novel feed-forward model achieves fast 3D stylization using sparse view images, maintaining multi-view consistency and high-quality style transfer while retaining reconstruction accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Stylizing 3D scenes instantly while maintaining multi-view consistency and faithfully resembling a style image remains a significant challenge. Current state-of-the-art 3D stylization methods typically involve computationally intensive test-time optimization to transfer artistic features into a pretrained 3D representation, often requiring dense posed input images. In contrast, leveraging recent advances in feed-forward reconstruction models, we demonstrate a novel approach to achieve direct 3D stylization in less than a second using unposed sparse-view scene images and an arbitrary style image. To address the inherent decoupling between reconstruction and stylization, we introduce a branched architecture that separates structure modeling and appearance shading, effectively preventing stylistic transfer from distorting the underlying 3D scene structure. Furthermore, we adapt an identity loss to facilitate pre-training our stylization model through the novel view synthesis task. This strategy also allows our model to retain its original reconstruction capabilities while being fine-tuned for stylization. Comprehensive evaluations, using both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality stylized 3D content that achieve a superior blend of style and scene appearance, while also outperforming existing methods in terms of multi-view consistency and efficiency.

This paper aims to overcome a major obstacle in scaling RL for reasoning with LLMs, namely the collapse of policy entropy. Such phenomenon is consistently observed across vast RL runs without entropy intervention, where the policy entropy dropped sharply at the early training stage, this diminished exploratory ability is always accompanied with the saturation of policy performance. In practice, we establish a transformation equation R=-a*e^H+b between entropy H and downstream performance R. This empirical law strongly indicates that, the policy performance is traded from policy entropy, thus bottlenecked by its exhaustion, and the ceiling is fully predictable H=0, R=-a+b. Our finding necessitates entropy management for continuous exploration toward scaling compute for RL. To this end, we investigate entropy dynamics both theoretically and empirically. Our derivation highlights that, the change in policy entropy is driven by the covariance between action probability and the change in logits, which is proportional to its advantage when using Policy Gradient-like algorithms. Empirical study shows that, the values of covariance term and entropy differences matched exactly, supporting the theoretical conclusion. Moreover, the covariance term stays mostly positive throughout training, further explaining why policy entropy would decrease monotonically. Through understanding the mechanism behind entropy dynamics, we motivate to control entropy by restricting the update of high-covariance tokens. Specifically, we propose two simple yet effective techniques, namely Clip-Cov and KL-Cov, which clip and apply KL penalty to tokens with high covariances respectively. Experiments show that these methods encourage exploration, thus helping policy escape entropy collapse and achieve better downstream performance.
