INTRODUCTION HE field of educational technology has seen remarkable advancements, with the emergence of transformative tools such as Learning Management Systems, Massive Open Online Courses, and Intelligent Tutoring Systems. These technologies have enabled shift towards distance learning models, allowing students to learn at their own pace and providing teachers with the ability to scale up effective teaching practices [1]. However, despite these innovations, many educational technologies do not substantially change the traditional role of teachers. Typical teaching activities, such as providing feedback, motivation, and content adaptation, are still primarily entrusted to human instructors, leading to the teacherbandwidth problem where there is shortage of teaching staff to provide highly informative and competence-oriented feedback at large scale [2]. The advent of ChatGPT, an application based on state-of-the-art GPT language models for natural language processing (NLP) model, has further expanded the potential of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Tracing its origins to the pioneering ELIZA chatbot developed in 1966, the capabilities of modern chatbots have become increasingly sophisticated, with the ability to engage in human-like conversations and provide personalized learning experiences [3]. Intelligent Tutoring Systems promise to address the limitations of traditional educational technologies by incorporating computational models to provide individualized learning, formative feedback, and personalized learning paths [4]. Chatbots, as subtype of dialog systems, have emerged as particularly promising approach, with the ability to simulate conversational partners and provide feedback through natural language [1, 5]. Despite their potential, deploying chatbots as Intelligent Tutoring Systems involves several complications. Due to their susceptibility to hallucinations and limited robustness, unsupervised chatbot usage may enable students to extract incorrect solutions from the system, which is particularly problem for weaker students [69]. Additionally, there is risk that C. Knievel, A. Bernhardt and C. Bernhardt are with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, HTWG Hochschule Konstanz, University of Applied Sciences, Germany (email: {cknievel,abernhard,cbernhard}@htwg-konstanz.de). students lose their sense of self-efficacy when solving tasks independently due to excessive support and instead develop dependency on the tutor [10, 11]. The application of intelligent tutoring systems to electrical engineering is very limited [12] and is restricted to static knowledge representation, lacking dynamic inference and application of knowledge to solve questions related to electrical circuits. In this paper, we develop an agentic tutor for electrical engineering (AITEE), which provides students with an interactive platform for asking questions about electrical circuits while ensuring reliability and accuracy of information, leveraging domain-specific contextual knowledge, and preventing excessive trust in and dependence on technology. To support students self-efficacy, AITEE employs Socratic dialogue that fosters learner autonomy through systematic questioning, guiding students toward logical conclusions [13, 14]. Furthermore, AITEE has to address the typical challenges faced by first-semester electrical engineering students when analyzing DC circuits, who need to apply both mathematical foundations, such as linear algebra, as well as electrical engineering principles, such as Kirchhoffs laws, to given circuit. This involves identifying and applying the solution approaches discussed in the lecture. An exemplary circuit is shown in Fig. 1, with the task of calculating the current I3 through the ohmic resistance. The challenge for AITEE is to identify the relevant context within the knowledge base given only the image of the circuit and the fragmented question: How do calculate the current I3? as input. We develop deep learning-based approach to detect the Fig. 1: Exemplary electrical circuit with current and voltage source as well as an ohmic resistor. 2 Circuit Scripts Students Detection of components and connections Conversion into Graph/Netlist Simulation with Spice Relevant context in vector database Retriever (RAG) LLM-Instructions Prompt Large Language Model Prompt: Output Fig. 2: Overview of the required components of AITEE. electrical components and their connections.

Next-event prediction (NEP) is proposed as a learning task to enable MLLMs to reason temporally over video inputs, using future video segments as a self-supervised signal.  					AI-generated summary 				 Next-token prediction serves as the foundational learning task enabling reasoning in LLMs. But what should the learning task be when aiming to equip MLLMs with temporal reasoning capabilities over video inputs? Existing tasks such as video question answering often rely on annotations from humans or much stronger MLLMs, while video captioning tends to entangle temporal reasoning with spatial information. To address this gap, we propose next-event prediction (NEP), a learning task that harnesses future video segments as a rich, self-supervised signal to foster temporal reasoning. We segment each video into past and future frames: the MLLM takes the past frames as input and predicts a summary of events derived from the future frames, thereby encouraging the model to reason temporally in order to complete the task. To support this task, we curate V1-33K, a dataset comprising 33,000 automatically extracted video segments spanning diverse real-world scenarios. We further explore a range of video instruction-tuning strategies to study their effects on temporal reasoning. To evaluate progress, we introduce FutureBench to assess coherence in predicting unseen future events. Experiments validate that NEP offers a scalable and effective training paradigm for fostering temporal reasoning in MLLMs.

Sherlock, a self-correction and self-improvement framework for reasoning vision-language models, enhances accuracy across benchmarks using limited annotated data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising performance on complex multimodal tasks. However, they still face significant challenges: they are highly sensitive to reasoning errors, require large volumes of annotated data or accurate verifiers, and struggle to generalize beyond specific domains. To address these limitations, we explore self-correction as a strategy to enhance reasoning VLMs. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of reasoning VLMs' self-correction abilities and identify key gaps. Based on our findings, we introduce Sherlock, a self-correction and self-improvement training framework. Sherlock introduces a trajectory-level self-correction objective, a preference data construction method based on visual perturbation, and a dynamic beta for preference tuning. Once the model acquires self-correction capabilities using only 20k randomly sampled annotated data, it continues to self-improve without external supervision. Built on the Llama3.2-Vision-11B model, Sherlock achieves remarkable results across eight benchmarks, reaching an average accuracy of 64.1 with direct generation and 65.4 after self-correction. It outperforms LLaVA-CoT (63.2), Mulberry (63.9), and LlamaV-o1 (63.4) while using less than 20% of the annotated data.

BraInCoRL employs a transformer-based in-context learning approach to model higher visual cortex neural responses with few-shot examples, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability across new subjects, stimuli, and datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Understanding functional representations within higher visual cortex is a fundamental question in computational neuroscience. While artificial neural networks pretrained on large-scale datasets exhibit striking representational alignment with human neural responses, learning image-computable models of visual cortex relies on individual-level, large-scale fMRI datasets. The necessity for expensive, time-intensive, and often impractical data acquisition limits the generalizability of encoders to new subjects and stimuli. BraInCoRL uses in-context learning to predict voxelwise neural responses from few-shot examples without any additional finetuning for novel subjects and stimuli. We leverage a transformer architecture that can flexibly condition on a variable number of in-context image stimuli, learning an inductive bias over multiple subjects. During training, we explicitly optimize the model for in-context learning. By jointly conditioning on image features and voxel activations, our model learns to directly generate better performing voxelwise models of higher visual cortex. We demonstrate that BraInCoRL consistently outperforms existing voxelwise encoder designs in a low-data regime when evaluated on entirely novel images, while also exhibiting strong test-time scaling behavior. The model also generalizes to an entirely new visual fMRI dataset, which uses different subjects and fMRI data acquisition parameters. Further, BraInCoRL facilitates better interpretability of neural signals in higher visual cortex by attending to semantically relevant stimuli. Finally, we show that our framework enables interpretable mappings from natural language queries to voxel selectivity.

An agent-based tutoring system for electrical engineering enhances learning through natural circuit interaction, context-retrieving generation, and guided questioning, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Intelligent tutoring systems combined with large language models offer a promising approach to address students' diverse needs and promote self-efficacious learning. While large language models possess good foundational knowledge of electrical engineering basics, they remain insufficiently capable of addressing specific questions about electrical circuits. In this paper, we present AITEE, an agent-based tutoring system for electrical engineering designed to accompany students throughout their learning process, offer individualized support, and promote self-directed learning. AITEE supports both hand-drawn and digital circuits through an adapted circuit reconstruction process, enabling natural interaction with students. Our novel graph-based similarity measure identifies relevant context from lecture materials through a retrieval augmented generation approach, while parallel Spice simulation further enhances accuracy in applying solution methodologies. The system implements a Socratic dialogue to foster learner autonomy through guided questioning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that AITEE significantly outperforms baseline approaches in domain-specific knowledge application, with even medium-sized LLM models showing acceptable performance. Our results highlight the potential of agentic tutors to deliver scalable, personalized, and effective learning environments for electrical engineering education.

First Finish Search improves accuracy in large language models by stopping inference at the first completed sample, significantly outperforming other decoding strategies in reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Test-time scaling (TTS), which involves dynamic allocation of compute during inference, offers a promising way to improve reasoning in large language models. While existing TTS methods work well, they often rely on long decoding paths or require a large number of samples to be generated, increasing the token usage and inference latency. We observe the surprising fact that for reasoning tasks, shorter traces are much more likely to be correct than longer ones. Motivated by this, we introduce First Finish Search (FFS), a training-free parallel decoding strategy that launches n independent samples and returns as soon as any one completes. We evaluate FFS alongside simple decoding, beam search, majority voting, and budget forcing on four reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1, R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, QwQ-32B and Phi-4-Reasoning-Plus) and across four datasets (AIME24, AIME25-I, AIME25-II and GPQA Diamond). With DeepSeek-R1, FFS achieves 82.23% accuracy on the AIME datasets, a 15% improvement over DeepSeek-R1's standalone accuracy, nearly matching OpenAI's o4-mini performance. Our theoretical analysis explains why stopping at the shortest trace is likely to yield a correct answer and identifies the conditions under which early stopping may be suboptimal. The elegance and simplicity of FFS demonstrate that straightforward TTS strategies can perform remarkably well, revealing the untapped potential of simple approaches at inference time.

With DeepSeek-R1, FFS achieves 82.23% accuracy on the AIME datasets, a 15% improvement over DeepSeek-R1's standalone accuracy, nearly matching OpenAI's o4-mini performance. Our theoretical analysis explains why stopping at the shortest trace is likely to yield a correct answer and identifies the conditions under which early stopping may be suboptimal. The elegance and simplicity of FFS demonstrate that straightforward TTS strategies can perform remarkably well, revealing the untapped potential of simple approaches at inference time."
