In this work, we present Skywork-OR1, an effective and scalable RL implementation for long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models. Building on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill model series, our RL approach achieves notable performance gains, increasing average accuracy across AIME24, AIME25, and LiveCodeBench from 57.8% to 72.8% (+15.0%) for the 32B model and from 43.6% to 57.5% (+13.9%) for the 7B model. Our Skywork-OR1-32B model surpasses both DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-32B on the AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks, while achieving comparable results on LiveCodeBench. The Skywork-OR1-7B and Skywork-OR1-Math-7B models demonstrate competitive reasoning capabilities among models of similar size. We perform comprehensive ablation studies on the core components of our training pipeline to validate their effectiveness. Additionally, we thoroughly investigate the phenomenon of entropy collapse, identify key factors affecting entropy dynamics, and demonstrate that mitigating premature entropy collapse is critical for improved test performance. To support community research, we fully open-source our model weights, training code, and training datasets. Figure 1: The performance curve of Skywork-OR1-32B during RL training for AIME 2024 and AIME 2025. The red stars indicate the selected final checkpoints. Equal contribution.

Examples of triangle-mesh based scenes rendered with RenderFormer without per-scene training or fine-tuning that include (multiple) specular reflections, complex shadows with details finer than triangle, diffuse indirect lighting, glossy reflections, soft and hard shadows, and multiple light sources. We present RenderFormer, neural rendering pipeline that directly renders an image from triangle-based representation of scene with full global illumination effects and that does not require per-scene training or fine-tuning. Instead of taking physics-centric approach to rendering, we formulate rendering as sequence-to-sequence transformation where sequence of tokens representing triangles with reflectance properties is converted to sequence of output tokens representing small patches of pixels. RenderFormer follows two stage pipeline: view-independent stage that models triangleto-triangle light transport, and view-dependent stage that transforms token representing bundle of rays to the corresponding pixel values guided by the triangle-sequence from the view-independent stage. Both stages are based on the transformer architecture and are learned with minimal prior constraints. We demonstrate and evaluate RenderFormer on scenes with varying complexity in shape and light transport. CCS Concepts: Computing methodologies Rendering.

However, existing platforms like Hugging Face do not explicitly utilize structured representations, limiting advanced queries and analyses such as tracing model evolution and recommending relevant datasets. To fill the gap, we construct HuggingKG, the first largescale knowledge graph built from the Hugging Face community for ML resource management. With 2.6 million nodes and 6.2 million edges, HuggingKG captures domain-specific relations and rich textual attributes. It enables us to further present HuggingBench, multi-task benchmark with three novel test collections for IR tasks including resource recommendation, classification, and tracing. Our experiments reveal unique characteristics of HuggingKG and the derived tasks. Both resources are publicly available, expected to advance research in open source resource sharing and management.

Improving Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the post-training stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL). However, these supervised methods require expensive and manually annotated multi-modal data--an ultimately unsustainable resource. While recent efforts have explored unsupervised post-training, their methods are complex and difficult to iterate. In this work, we are the first to investigate the use of GRPO, a stable and scalable online RL algorithm, for enabling continual self-improvement without any external supervision. We propose MM-UPT, a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised post-training of MLLMs. MM-UPT builds upon GRPO, replacing traditional reward signals with a self-rewarding mechanism based on majority voting over multiple sampled responses. Our experiments demonstrate that MM-UPT significantly improves the reasoning ability of Qwen2.5-VL-7B (e.g., 66.3 %rightarrow72.9 % on MathVista, 62.9 %rightarrow68.7 % on We-Math), using standard dataset without ground truth labels. MM-UPT also outperforms prior unsupervised baselines and even approaches the results of supervised GRPO. Furthermore, we show that incorporating synthetic questions, generated solely by MLLM itself, can boost performance as well, highlighting a promising approach for scalable self-improvement. Overall, MM-UPT offers a new paradigm for continual, autonomous enhancement of MLLMs in the absence of external supervision. Our code is available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/MM-UPT.

DeepResearchGym provides an open-source evaluation framework for deep research systems using a reproducible search API and LLM-as-a-judge assessments.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep research systems represent an emerging class of agentic information retrieval methods that generate comprehensive and well-supported reports to complex queries. However, most existing frameworks rely on dynamic commercial search APIs, which pose reproducibility and transparency challenges in addition to their cost. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepResearchGym, an open-source sandbox that combines a reproducible search API with a rigorous evaluation protocol for benchmarking deep research systems. The API indexes large-scale public web corpora, namely ClueWeb22 and FineWeb, using a state-of-the-art dense retriever and approximate nearest neighbor search via DiskANN. It achieves lower latency than popular commercial APIs while ensuring stable document rankings across runs, and is freely available for research use. To evaluate deep research systems' outputs, we extend the Researchy Questions benchmark with automatic metrics through LLM-as-a-judge assessments to measure alignment with users' information needs, retrieval faithfulness, and report quality. Experimental results show that systems integrated with DeepResearchGym achieve performance comparable to those using commercial APIs, with performance rankings remaining consistent across evaluation metrics. A human evaluation study further confirms that our automatic protocol aligns with human preferences, validating the framework's ability to help support controlled assessment of deep research systems. Our code and API documentation are available at https://www.deepresearchgym.ai.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities, with reinforcement learning (RL) playing a crucial role in this progress. While "aha moment" patterns--where models exhibit self-correction through reflection--are often attributed to emergent properties from RL, we first demonstrate that these patterns exist in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) prior to RL training but may not necessarily correlate with improved reasoning performance. Building on these insights, we present a comprehensive study on enhancing multimodal reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start with structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, followed by (2) reinforcement learning via GRPO to further refine these capabilities. Our extensive experiments show that this combined approach consistently outperforms both SFT-only and RL-only methods across challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks. The resulting models achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs at both 3B and 7B scales, with our 7B model showing substantial improvements over base models (e.g., 66.3 %rightarrow73.4 % on MathVista, 62.9 %rightarrow70.4 % on We-Math) and our 3B model achieving performance competitive with several 7B models. Overall, this work provides practical guidance for building advanced multimodal reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/RL-with-Cold-Start.

"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities, with reinforcement learning (RL) playing a crucial role in this progress. While "aha moment" patterns--where models exhibit self-correction through reflection--are often attributed to emergent properties from RL, we first demonstrate that these patterns exist in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) prior to RL training but may not necessarily correlate with improved reasoning performance. Building on these insights, we present a comprehensive study on enhancing multimodal reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start with structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, followed by (2) reinforcement learning via GRPO to further refine these capabilities. Our extensive experiments show that this combined approach consistently outperforms both SFT-only and RL-only methods across challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks. The resulting models achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs at both 3B and 7B scales, with our 7B model showing substantial improvements over base models (e.g., 66.3 %rightarrow73.4 % on MathVista, 62.9 %rightarrow70.4 % on We-Math) and our 3B model achieving performance competitive with several 7B models. Overall, this work provides practical guidance for building advanced multimodal reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/RL-with-Cold-Start."

The success of DeepSeek-R1 underscores the significant role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we present Skywork-OR1, an effective and scalable RL implementation for long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models. Building on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill model series, our RL approach achieves notable performance gains, increasing average accuracy across AIME24, AIME25, and LiveCodeBench from 57.8% to 72.8% (+15.0%) for the 32B model and from 43.6% to 57.5% (+13.9%) for the 7B model. Our Skywork-OR1-32B model surpasses both DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-32B on the AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks, while achieving comparable results on LiveCodeBench. The Skywork-OR1-7B and Skywork-OR1-Math-7B models demonstrate competitive reasoning capabilities among models of similar size. We perform comprehensive ablation studies on the core components of our training pipeline to validate their effectiveness. Additionally, we thoroughly investigate the phenomenon of entropy collapse, identify key factors affecting entropy dynamics, and demonstrate that mitigating premature entropy collapse is critical for improved test performance. To support community research, we fully open-source our model weights, training code, and training datasets.

Roads to Rome (R2R) selectively utilizes large language models for critical reasoning tasks to enhance efficiency and performance in lightweight models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities at the cost of substantial inference overhead, posing substantial deployment challenges. Although distilled Small Language Models (SLMs) significantly enhance efficiency, their performance suffers as they fail to follow LLMs' reasoning paths. Luckily, we reveal that only a small fraction of tokens genuinely diverge reasoning paths between LLMs and SLMs. Most generated tokens are either identical or exhibit neutral differences, such as minor variations in abbreviations or expressions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce **Roads to Rome (R2R)**, a neural token routing method that selectively utilizes LLMs only for these critical, path-divergent tokens, while leaving the majority of token generation to the SLM. We also develop an automatic data generation pipeline that identifies divergent tokens and generates token-level routing labels to train the lightweight router. We apply R2R to combine R1-1.5B and R1-32B models from the DeepSeek family, and evaluate on challenging math, coding, and QA benchmarks. With an average activated parameter size of 5.6B, R2R surpasses the average accuracy of R1-7B by 1.6x, outperforming even the R1-14B model. Compared to R1-32B, it delivers a 2.8x wall-clock speedup with comparable performance, advancing the Pareto frontier of test-time scaling efficiency.

Addressing intricate real-world problems necessitates in-depth information seeking and multi-step reasoning. Recent progress in agentic systems, exemplified by Deep Research, underscores the potential for autonomous multi-step research. In this work, we present a cohesive paradigm for building end-to-end agentic information seeking agents from a data-centric and training-stage perspective. Our approach consists of four key stages: (1) browsing data construction, (2) trajectories sampling, (3) supervised fine-tuning for effective cold start, and (4) reinforcement learning for enhanced generalisation. We instantiate this framework in a web agent based on the ReAct, WebDancer. Empirical evaluations on the challenging information seeking benchmarks, GAIA and WebWalkerQA, demonstrate the strong performance of WebDancer, achieving considerable results and highlighting the efficacy of our training paradigm. Further analysis of agent training provides valuable insights and actionable, systematic pathways for developing more capable agentic models. The codes and demo will be released in https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/WebAgent.

"Addressing intricate real-world problems necessitates in-depth information seeking and multi-step reasoning. Recent progress in agentic systems, exemplified by Deep Research, underscores the potential for autonomous multi-step research. In this work, we present a cohesive paradigm for building end-to-end agentic information seeking agents from a data-centric and training-stage perspective. Our approach consists of four key stages: (1) browsing data construction, (2) trajectories sampling, (3) supervised fine-tuning for effective cold start, and (4) reinforcement learning for enhanced generalisation. We instantiate this framework in a web agent based on the ReAct, WebDancer. Empirical evaluations on the challenging information seeking benchmarks, GAIA and WebWalkerQA, demonstrate the strong performance of WebDancer, achieving considerable results and highlighting the efficacy of our training paradigm. Further analysis of agent training provides valuable insights and actionable, systematic pathways for developing more capable agentic models. The codes and demo will be released in https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/WebAgent."

We present RenderFormer, a neural rendering pipeline that directly renders an image from a triangle-based representation of a scene with full global illumination effects and that does not require per-scene training or fine-tuning. Instead of taking a physics-centric approach to rendering, we formulate rendering as a sequence-to-sequence transformation where a sequence of tokens representing triangles with reflectance properties is converted to a sequence of output tokens representing small patches of pixels. RenderFormer follows a two stage pipeline: a view-independent stage that models triangle-to-triangle light transport, and a view-dependent stage that transforms a token representing a bundle of rays to the corresponding pixel values guided by the triangle-sequence from the view-independent stage. Both stages are based on the transformer architecture and are learned with minimal prior constraints. We demonstrate and evaluate RenderFormer on scenes with varying complexity in shape and light transport.

Generating high-quality, multi-layer transparent images from text prompts can unlock a new level of creative control, allowing users to edit each layer as effortlessly as editing text outputs from LLMs. However, the development of multi-layer generative models lags behind that of conventional text-to-image models due to the absence of a large, high-quality corpus of multi-layer transparent data. In this paper, we address this fundamental challenge by: (i) releasing the first open, ultra-high-fidelity PrismLayers (PrismLayersPro) dataset of 200K (20K) multilayer transparent images with accurate alpha mattes, (ii) introducing a trainingfree synthesis pipeline that generates such data on demand using off-the-shelf diffusion models, and (iii) delivering a strong, open-source multi-layer generation model, ART+, which matches the aesthetics of modern text-to-image generation models. The key technical contributions include: LayerFLUX, which excels at generating high-quality single transparent layers with accurate alpha mattes, and MultiLayerFLUX, which composes multiple LayerFLUX outputs into complete images, guided by human-annotated semantic layout. To ensure higher quality, we apply a rigorous filtering stage to remove artifacts and semantic mismatches, followed by human selection. Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art ART model on our synthetic PrismLayersPro yields ART+, which outperforms the original ART in 60% of head-to-head user study comparisons and even matches the visual quality of images generated by the FLUX.1-[dev] model. We anticipate that our work will establish a solid dataset foundation for the multi-layer transparent image generation task, enabling research and applications that require precise, editable, and visually compelling layered imagery.

Traditional RLHF optimizes language models with coarse, scalar rewards that mask the fine-grained reasons behind success or failure, leading to slow and opaque learning. Recent work augments RL with textual critiques through prompting or reflection, improving interpretability but leaving model parameters untouched. We introduce Text2Grad, a reinforcement-learning paradigm that turns free-form textual feedback into span-level gradients. Given human (or programmatic) critiques, Text2Grad aligns each feedback phrase with the relevant token spans, converts these alignments into differentiable reward signals, and performs gradient updates that directly refine the offending portions of the model's policy. This yields precise, feedback-conditioned adjustments instead of global nudges. Text2Grad is realized through three components: (1) a high-quality feedback-annotation pipeline that pairs critiques with token spans; (2) a fine-grained reward model that predicts span-level reward on answer while generating explanatory critiques; and (3) a span-level policy optimizer that back-propagates natural-language gradients. Across summarization, code generation, and question answering, Text2Grad consistently surpasses scalar-reward RL and prompt-only baselines, providing both higher task metrics and richer interpretability. Our results demonstrate that natural-language feedback, when converted to gradients, is a powerful signal for fine-grained policy optimization. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/microsoft/Text2Grad

"Traditional RLHF optimizes language models with coarse, scalar rewards that mask the fine-grained reasons behind success or failure, leading to slow and opaque learning. Recent work augments RL with textual critiques through prompting or reflection, improving interpretability but leaving model parameters untouched. We introduce Text2Grad, a reinforcement-learning paradigm that turns free-form textual feedback into span-level gradients. Given human (or programmatic) critiques, Text2Grad aligns each feedback phrase with the relevant token spans, converts these alignments into differentiable reward signals, and performs gradient updates that directly refine the offending portions of the model's policy. This yields precise, feedback-conditioned adjustments instead of global nudges. Text2Grad is realized through three components: (1) a high-quality feedback-annotation pipeline that pairs critiques with token spans; (2) a fine-grained reward model that predicts span-level reward on answer while generating explanatory critiques; and (3) a span-level policy optimizer that back-propagates natural-language gradients. Across summarization, code generation, and question answering, Text2Grad consistently surpasses scalar-reward RL and prompt-only baselines, providing both higher task metrics and richer interpretability. Our results demonstrate that natural-language feedback, when converted to gradients, is a powerful signal for fine-grained policy optimization. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/microsoft/Text2Grad"

A framework called PIR refines the importance of reasoning steps in large language models by pruning low-importance functional elements, leading to more concise reasoning chains with improved accuracy and reduced computational demands.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through test-time scaling approaches, particularly when fine-tuned with chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from more powerful large reasoning models (LRMs). However, these reasoning chains often contain verbose elements that mirror human problem-solving, categorized as progressive reasoning (the essential solution development path) and functional elements (verification processes, alternative solution approaches, and error corrections). While progressive reasoning is crucial, the functional elements significantly increase computational demands during test-time inference. We introduce PIR (Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), a principled framework that quantitatively evaluates the importance of each reasoning step based on its impact on answer prediction confidence. PIR systematically identifies and selectively prunes only low-importance functional steps while preserving progressive reasoning components, creating optimized training data that maintains the integrity of the core solution path while reducing verbosity. Models fine-tuned on PIR-optimized data exhibit superior test-time scaling properties, generating more concise reasoning chains while achieving improved accuracy (+0.9\% to +6.6\%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3\% to -41\%) across challenging reasoning benchmarks (AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond). Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability across different model sizes, data sources, and token budgets, offering a practical solution for deploying reasoning-capable LLMs in scenarios where efficient test-time scaling, response time, and computational efficiency are valuable constraints.

The DynToM benchmark evaluates LLMs' ability to track and understand the temporal progression of mental states, revealing significant gaps compared to human performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly participate in human-AI interactions, evaluating their Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities - particularly their ability to track dynamic mental states - becomes crucial. While existing benchmarks assess basic ToM abilities, they predominantly focus on static snapshots of mental states, overlooking the temporal evolution that characterizes real-world social interactions. We present DynToM, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand and track the temporal progression of mental states across interconnected scenarios. Through a systematic four-step framework, we generate 1,100 social contexts encompassing 5,500 scenarios and 78,100 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Our comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that their average performance underperforms humans by 44.7\%, with performance degrading significantly when tracking and reasoning about the shift of mental states. This performance gap highlights fundamental limitations in current LLMs' ability to model the dynamic nature of human mental states.

HuggingKG, a large-scale knowledge graph, enhances open source ML resource management by enabling advanced queries and analyses via HuggingBench.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid growth of open source machine learning (ML) resources, such as models and datasets, has accelerated IR research. However, existing platforms like Hugging Face do not explicitly utilize structured representations, limiting advanced queries and analyses such as tracing model evolution and recommending relevant datasets. To fill the gap, we construct HuggingKG, the first large-scale knowledge graph built from the Hugging Face community for ML resource management. With 2.6 million nodes and 6.2 million edges, HuggingKG captures domain-specific relations and rich textual attributes. It enables us to further present HuggingBench, a multi-task benchmark with three novel test collections for IR tasks including resource recommendation, classification, and tracing. Our experiments reveal unique characteristics of HuggingKG and the derived tasks. Both resources are publicly available, expected to advance research in open source resource sharing and management.
