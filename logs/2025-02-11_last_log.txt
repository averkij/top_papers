Vector similarity metrics assign numerical score to quantify the similarity between an embedded prompt and its nearest neighbor in the cache. Existing systems rely on static threshold to classify whether the similarity score is sufficiently high to result in cache hit. We show that this one-size-fits-all threshold is insufficient across different prompts. We propose VectorQ, framework to learn embedding-specific threshold regions that adapt to the complexity and uncertainty of an embedding. Through evaluations on combination of four diverse datasets, we show that VectorQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems across all static thresholds, achieving up to 12 increases in cache hit rate and error rate reductions up to 92%. 1. Introduction Semantic prompt caches can reduce large language model (LLM) inference latency by up to 100x by reusing cached LLM-generated responses for semantically similar prompts (Bang, 2023). These systems convert prompts into vector embeddings and cache them in vector database along with their corresponding LLM-generated responses (Dasgupta et al., 2025). prompt that is currently being processed is referred to as candidate. Given new candidate, the system must decide whether to return cached response, known as reuse, or generate new one with an expensive LLM inference (Li et al., 2024). The system retrieves its nearest neighbor from the vector database when processing candidate. cache hit occurs when the system returns the *Equal contribution 1University of California, Berkeley 2Technical University of Munich 3ETH Zurich 4Stanford University. Correspondence to: Luis Gaspar Schroeder <luisgasparschroeder[at]berkeley.edu>. nn, nn, R3 Figure 1. Left: VectorQ learns embedding-specific similarity threshold regions (R1 nn) to make cache hit or miss decisions in semantic prompt caches. Bayesian sampling, guided by an embedding-specific correctness posterior (orange line), enables VectorQ to prioritize re-evaluations for uncertain cache hits. Right: VectorQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semantic prompt caches across all static thresholds by achieving higher number of cache hits and reduced number of errors. previously cached LLM-generated response of the nearest neighbor as the candidates response. Conversely, cache miss occurs when the system cannot return the cached response and instead performs an expensive LLM inference to generate new response for the candidate. Determining whether the nearest neighbor is suitable for cache hit remains an open research question, as the candidate may require different LLM response (Bang, 2023; Dasgupta et al., 2025; Li et al., 2024). For example, consider cache containing research papers on Biology and Architecture. When the system processes new candidate whose prompt request is for Chemistry paper, the nearest neighbor might be Biology paper. Consequently, semantic prompt caches rely on vector similarity metrics to evaluate the contextual similarity of embeddings and determine whether the nearest neighbors cached response can be reused. Metrics such as cosine similarity (Rahutomo et al., 2012) and Euclidean distance (Globerson et al., 2004) provide numerical scores to quantify the similarity between two embeddings. We consider normalized scores, where 0.0 indicates no similarity between embeddings and 1.0 identical ones. At the extremes, similarity score of 0.0 indicates no similarity, requiring the system to generate new LLM response, while score of 1.0 implies an identical match, allowing the cache to reuse the cached response confidently. However, it is unclear which value between 0.0 and 1.0 is 1 Adaptive Semantic Prompt Caching with VectorQ sufficient to classify the nearest neighbor as similar enough. This value is called the threshold. State-of-the-art semantic prompt caches, such as GPTCache (Bang, 2023), use single static threshold throughout the caches runtime. Users either rely on predefined threshold (e.g., 0.7) or determine one by testing multiple thresholds and selecting the value that best fits their requirements (Dasgupta et al., 2025). If the threshold is set too low, the system might produce incorrect cache hits, where it reuses the cached response from the nearest neighbor, but the response differs from the one the candidate requires (Rekabsaz et al., 2017). Vice versa, if the threshold is set too high, the system may avoid cache hits entirely. Our work demonstrates that static threshold is inadequate for classifying different prompts as semantically similar (Section 4). Instead of one static threshold value uniformly applied across all embeddings, we propose VectorQ, framework that learns embedding-specific threshold regions that adapt to each embedding (Section 5.1). Given candidate and its nearest neighbor, along with its cached LLMgenerated response and threshold regions, the system determines its action based on the similarity between the candidate and the nearest neighbor. If the similarity falls within region spanned by similarity values that previously led to correct cache hits, the system returns the cached response (cache hit). Otherwise, it generates new LLM response (cache miss). VectorQ defines these regions by analyzing the similarity scores linked to correct and incorrect cache hits for each embedding (Figure 1). Through Bayesian inference-based (Bayes, 1763) sampling approach, VectorQ prioritizes the correctness re-evaluation of the most uncertain regions and guarantees threshold region convergence that minimizes the number of incorrect cache hits (Section 5.2). Users can adjust the caches accuracy-latency trade-off using the uncertainty gate parameter (Section 5.3). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by replacing the static similarity threshold with VectorQ to showcase the impact of dynamic and embedding-specific threshold regions. We evaluate our approach using combination of four diverse datasets (Saurabh Shahane, 2023; Talmor et al., 2018; Ni et al., 2019; Rogers et al., 2023) and use them in novel semantic prompt cache benchmark (Appendix E) designed to simulate challenging workload conditions by alterna"

Semantic prompt caches reduce the latency and cost of large language model (LLM) inference by reusing cached LLM-generated responses for semantically similar prompts. Vector similarity metrics assign a numerical score to quantify the similarity between an embedded prompt and its nearest neighbor in the cache. Existing systems rely on a static threshold to classify whether the similarity score is sufficiently high to result in a cache hit. We show that this one-size-fits-all threshold is insufficient across different prompts. We propose VectorQ, a framework to learn embedding-specific threshold regions that adapt to the complexity and uncertainty of an embedding. Through evaluations on a combination of four diverse datasets, we show that VectorQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems across all static thresholds, achieving up to 12x increases in cache hit rate and error rate reductions up to 92%.
