Text:"Preserving Privacy, Increasing Accessibility, and Reducing Cost: An On-Device Artificial Intelligence Model for Medical Transcription and Note Generation Johnson Thomas1, Ayush Mudgal2, Wendao Liu2, Nisten Tahiraj3, Zeeshaan Mohammed4, Dhruv DiddiBackground: Clinical documentation represents significant burden for healthcare providers, with physicians spending up to 2 hours daily on administrative tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit their adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the browser. Methods: We fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140 modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple clinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1 improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13 to 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete on-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI adoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility for resource-constrained environments.

Introduction The administrative burden of clinical documentation has reached crisis proportions in modern healthcare, with physicians dedicating 50% of their time to electronic health record (EHR) tasks[1]. This documentation burden contributes significantly to physician burnout, with studies indicating that for every hour of direct patient care, clinicians spend nearly two hours on EHR-related activities [2,3]. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) presents opportunities to automate clinical documentation, particularly through the generation of structured clinical notes from physician-patient conversations [4]. Current AI-powered transcription solutions, while demonstrating impressive capabilities, face significant adoption barriers in healthcare settings. Cloud-based systems raise substantial privacy concerns given the sensitive nature of patient data and strict regulatory requirements under HIPAA and similar frameworks [6]. Cloud-based solutions require transmitting patient data to external servers, raising concerns about data breaches and unauthorized access. Additionally, the computational requirements and associated costs of state-of-the-art models create accessibility barriers for smaller healthcare practices and resource-constrained environments . The advent of smaller, more efficient LLMs has opened new possibilities for on-device deployment. Models like Llama 3.2 1B demonstrate that significant language understanding capabilities can be achieved with substantially reduced computational requirements [5]. When combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), these models can be adapted for specialized medical tasks while maintaining feasibility for local deployment [7]. This study presents the development and evaluation of an on-device medical transcription system built upon fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B model. Our approach addresses the critical need for privacy-preserving, cost-effective clinical documentation tools that can operate entirely on local hardware in browser without compromising patient data security or requiring ongoing subscription costs. 2. Related WorkThe application of LLMs to healthcare has gained significant traction in recent years. Google's Med-PaLM and Med-PaLM 2 demonstrated that LLMs could achieve physician-level performance on medical question-answering tasks [8]. Similarly, Microsoft's BioGPT showed promising results in biomedical text generation and mining [9]. However, these models typically require substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. Recent work has focused on developing more compact medical LLMs. Chen et al. introduced MedAlpaca, 7B parameter model fine-tuned on medical data [10]. While more efficient than larger models, it still requires dedicated GPU resources for real-time inference. The ChatDoctor model by Li et al. demonstrated that fine-tuning on medical conversations could improve domain-specific performance [11].The Sound of Healthcare study showed that LLMs can achieve state-of-the-art performance in medical transcription tasks, particularly in speaker diarization and Word Error Rate reduction using Chain-of-Thought prompting [12]. Other opensource efforts have explored finetuning compact LLMs (7B mistral model) for specialtyspecific note generation, demonstrating gains compared to similarly sized baselines [13]. These findings establish the technical feasibility of LLM-based medical transcription while highlighting the importance of domain-specific adaptation."
