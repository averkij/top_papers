Text:"ArtifactsBench: Bridging the Visual-Interactive Gap in LLM Code Generation Evaluation 2025-07-08 Tencent Hunyuan TeamThe generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This progress is bottlenecked by critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArtifactsBench, new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then assessed by Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring. We construct new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30 leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves striking 94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models. 5 2 0 2 7 ] . [ 1 2 5 9 4 0 . 7 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Automation level versus humanalignment across evaluation frameworks. The red star marks the fully manual WebDev Arena (100% human effort), while the blue bubble denotes our checklist-guided MLLM evaluation, ArtifactsBench, which achieves 94.4% agreement with human votes with 100% automation. Grey circles represent prior automated benchmarks.Large Language Models (LLMs) are catalyzing paradigm shift in software creation, extending their generative capabilities from traditional code and text to the dynamic and sophisticated realm of interactive visual artifacts (Jaech et al., 2024; Anthropic, 2025; Guo et al., 2025). This evolution is enabling novel applications, from crafting responsive web interfaces and data visualizations to developing interactive game environments (Jiang et al., 2024; 1 Lu et al., 2025a). cornerstone of this new paradigm is the Artifactnot just static code snippet, but selfcontained, model-generated, and executable entity (e.g., web widget, data visualization) that synthesizes code, visual presentation, and interaction logic for users to directly inspect, manipulate, and experience. This fosters fluid, real-time collaborative workflow between humans and AI. However, while the generative potential of LLMs is immense, our ability to rigorously and comprehensively evaluate their outputs in this domain lags significantly. This evaluation gap has become critical bottleneck, impeding targeted improvements and the systematic advancement of this technology. Figure 1 starkly illustrates this challenge, positioning existing evaluation frameworks in trade-off between automation and human-alignmenta gap that ArtifactsBench is explicitly designed to bridge. Current evaluation methodologies for code generation are ill-equipped for this new interactive frontier. Prevailing benchmarks predominantly focus on static code attributes, such as syntactic correctness (e.g., pass@k in HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021)) or functional task completion in non-visual contexts (e.g., resolving GitHub issues in SWEbench (Jimenez et al., 2023)). Others assess visual code generation from static perspective, by replicating visual designs from images (Wust et al., 2024; Yun et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024), translating descriptions into structured graphics (Rodriguez et al., 2023; Xing et al., 2025), or relying on non-visual proxies for fidelity like DOM tree comparisons (Xu et al., 2025). These approaches, however, fail to capture the holistic quality of interactive artifacts. They cannot quantify crucial aspects of visual fidelitysuch as layout integrity and aesthetic coherencenor can they validate the correctness and fluidity of dynamic user interactions, like button responses, state transitions, or animations. Consequently, evaluation often defaults to costly and subjective manual inspection or unreliable LLM self-evaluation, which lack the scale, objectivity, and multimodal acuity required for robust scientific assessment. This paper confronts the central research question: How can we automatically and holistically evaluate an LLMs ability to transform multimodal instructionsspanning text, images, and interactional logicinto high-quality, interactive visual artifacts? We argue that successful evaluation framework must transcend static code analysis and embrace the multifaceted nature of the user experience. Such framework must assess not only the codes functional correctness but also its visual presentation and, critically, its dynamic behavior over time. It must provide fine-grained, diagnostic feedback to illuminate specific model strengths and weaknesses, thereby guiding future research. To this end, we introduce ArtifactsBench, comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on the creation of interactive visual artifacts. We have constructed new, large-scale benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks, meticulously curated through multi-stage pipeline that blends expert sourcing with LLM-based generation and refinement. As illustrated in Figure 2, these tasks span nine primary domainsfrom web development and data visualization to interactive gamesand are stratified by complexity to enable fine-grained analysis of model capabilities. This rigorous design ensures ArtifactsBench serves as challenging and ecologically valid testbed for the next generation of visual code generators. Our primary contributions are threefold: Diverse and Hierarchical Benchmark Suite. ArtifactsBench comprises rich set of tasks derived from real-world applications, including component-based web development, SVG-based data visualization, and interactive mini-games. Tasks are stratified by complexity (simple, medium, hard) to robustly"
