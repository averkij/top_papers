Text:"ArtifactsBench: Bridging the Visual-Interactive Gap in LLM Code Generation Evaluation 2025-07-08 Tencent Hunyuan TeamThe generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This progress is bottlenecked by critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArtifactsBench, new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then assessed by Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring. We construct new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30 leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves striking 94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models. 5 2 0 2 7 ] . [ 1 2 5 9 4 0 . 7 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Automation level versus humanalignment across evaluation frameworks. The red star marks the fully manual WebDev Arena (100% human effort), while the blue bubble denotes our checklist-guided MLLM evaluation, ArtifactsBench, which achieves 94.4% agreement with human votes with 100% automation. Grey circles represent prior automated benchmarks.Large Language Models (LLMs) are catalyzing paradigm shift in software creation, extending their generative capabilities from traditional code and text to the dynamic and sophisticated realm of interactive visual artifacts (Jaech et al., 2024; Anthropic, 2025; Guo et al., 2025). This evolution is enabling novel applications, from crafting responsive web interfaces and data visualizations to developing interactive game environments (Jiang et al., 2024; 1 Lu et al., 2025a). cornerstone of this new paradigm is the Artifactnot just static code snippet, but selfcontained, model-generated, and executable entity (e.g., web widget, data visualization) that synthesizes code, visual presentation, and interaction logic for users to directly inspect, manipulate, and experience. This fosters fluid, real-time collaborative workflow between humans and AI. However, while the generative potential of LLMs is immense, our ability to rigorously and comprehensively evaluate their outputs in this domain lags significantly. This evaluation gap has become critical bottleneck, impeding targeted improvements and the systematic advancement of this technology. Figure 1 starkly illustrates this challenge, positioning existing evaluation frameworks in trade-off between automation and human-alignmenta gap that ArtifactsBench is explicitly designed to bridge. Current evaluation methodologies for code generation are ill-equipped for this new interactive frontier. Prevailing benchmarks predominantly focus on static code attributes, such as syntactic correctness (e.g., pass@k in HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021)) or functional task completion in non-visual contexts (e.g., resolving GitHub issues in SWEbench (Jimenez et al., 2023)). Others assess visual code generation from static perspective, by replicating visual designs from images (Wust et al., 2024; Yun et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024), translating descriptions into structured graphics (Rodriguez et al., 2023; Xing et al., 2025), or relying on non-visual proxies for fidelity like DOM tree comparisons (Xu et al., 2025). These approaches, however, fail to capture the holistic quality of interactive artifacts. They cannot quantify crucial aspects of visual fidelitysuch as layout integrity and aesthetic coherencenor can they validate the correctness and fluidity of dynamic user interactions, like button responses, state transitions, or animations. Consequently, evaluation often defaults to costly and subjective manual inspection or unreliable LLM self-evaluation, which lack the scale, objectivity, and multimodal acuity required for robust scientific assessment. This paper confronts the central research question: How can we automatically and holistically evaluate an LLMs ability to transform multimodal instructionsspanning text, images, and interactional logicinto high-quality, interactive visual artifacts? We argue that successful evaluation framework must transcend static code analysis and embrace the multifaceted nature of the user experience. Such framework must assess not only the codes functional correctness but also its visual presentation and, critically, its dynamic behavior over time. It must provide fine-grained, diagnostic feedback to illuminate specific model strengths and weaknesses, thereby guiding future research. To this end, we introduce ArtifactsBench, comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on the creation of interactive visual artifacts. We have constructed new, large-scale benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks, meticulously curated through multi-stage pipeline that blends expert sourcing with LLM-based generation and refinement. As illustrated in Figure 2, these tasks span nine primary domainsfrom web development and data visualization to interactive gamesand are stratified by complexity to enable fine-grained analysis of model capabilities. This rigorous design ensures ArtifactsBench serves as challenging and ecologically valid testbed for the next generation of visual code generators. Our primary contributions are threefold: Diverse and Hierarchical Benchmark Suite. ArtifactsBench comprises rich set of tasks derived from real-world applications, including component-based web development, SVG-based data visualization, and interactive mini-games. Tasks are stratified by complexity (simple, medium, hard) to robustly"

This paper introduces Mod-X (Modular Open Decentralized eXchange), novel architectural framework proposal for agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols. Unlike current approaches, Mod-X proposes layered architecture with Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present ModXs architecture, compare it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through worked example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents (agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge representationsincluding rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). Mod-Xs key innovations include publish-subscribe communication model, semantic capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestrationproviding framework that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central coordination.

DreamVLA improves robot manipulation through a VLA framework that incorporates world knowledge, dynamic-region guidance, and a diffusion-based transformer to ensure clear, disentangled representations for action planning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.

X-Planner, a planning system utilizing a multimodal large language model, decomposes complex text-guided image editing instructions into precise sub-instructions, ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits and achieving top performance on established benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent diffusion-based image editing methods have significantly advanced text-guided tasks but often struggle to interpret complex, indirect instructions. Moreover, current models frequently suffer from poor identity preservation, unintended edits, or rely heavily on manual masks. To address these challenges, we introduce X-Planner, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based planning system that effectively bridges user intent with editing model capabilities. X-Planner employs chain-of-thought reasoning to systematically decompose complex instructions into simpler, clear sub-instructions. For each sub-instruction, X-Planner automatically generates precise edit types and segmentation masks, eliminating manual intervention and ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits. Additionally, we propose a novel automated pipeline for generating large-scale data to train X-Planner which achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing benchmarks and our newly introduced complex editing benchmark.

"State-of-the-art large language models are evaluated on forecasting questions and show lower accuracy compared to human superforecasters.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, but their ability to forecast future events remains understudied. A year ago, large language models struggle to come close to the accuracy of a human crowd. I evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on 464 forecasting questions from Metaculus, comparing their performance against human superforecasters. Frontier models achieve Brier scores that ostensibly surpass the human crowd but still significantly underperform a group of superforecasters."

As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols. Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents (agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central coordination.

A streaming video generation model named StreamDiT, based on transformer-based diffusion models, enables real-time video generation with high content consistency and visual quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method, we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation, the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive generation, and video-to-video.
