Text:"Untied Ulysses: Memory-Efficient Context Parallelism via Headwise Chunking Ravi Ghadia 1 Maksim Abraham 1 Sergei Vorobyov 1 Max Ryabinin 1 6 2 0 2 4 2 ] . [ 1 6 9 1 1 2 . 2 0 6 2 : r aEfficiently processing long sequences with Transformer models usually requires splitting the computations across accelerators via context parallelism. The dominant approaches in this family of methods, such as Ring Attention or DeepSpeed Ulysses, enable scaling over the context dimension but do not focus on memory efficiency, which limits the sequence lengths they can support. More advanced techniques, such as Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer or activation offloading, can further extend the possible context length at the cost of training throughput. In this paper, we present UPipe, simple yet effective context parallelism technique that performs fine-grained chunking at the attention head level. This technique significantly reduces the activation memory usage of self-attention, breaking the activation memory barrier and unlocking much longer context lengths. Our approach reduces intermediate tensor memory usage in the attention layer by as much as 87.5% for 32B Transformers, while matching previous context parallelism techniques in terms of training speed. UPipe can support the context length of 5M tokens when training Llama3-8B on single 8H100 node, improving upon prior methods by over 25%. 1. Introduction The Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) has powered significant advances in AI in recent years, ranging from language models with agentic and reasoning capabilities (Gemini Team, 2025; Kimi Team et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025) to video generation (Team Wan et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025; Sand.ai et al., 2025). As the field continues to progress, the demand for longer context lengths in AI models continues to grow due to applications such as code generation (Li et al., 2023a; Hui et al., 2024), long document understanding (Chia et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024), or 1Together AI. Correspondence to: Ravi Ghadia <rghadia@together.ai>, Max Ryabinin <mryab@together.ai>. Preprint. February 25, 2026. 1 Figure 1. Comparison of context parallelism approaches on longsequence training for Llama 3-8B using 8 H100s. UPipe provides maximum efficiency, resulting in longer maximum context length (5M tokens) while retaining throughput. even audio processing (Hori et al., 2021). However, training models to effectively process such long sequences is limited by the accelerator hardware: beyond certain limit, even keeping the activations necessary for self-attention becomes bottleneck. As result, methods that reduce the memory requirements of long-context training have recently attracted surge of research interest. The most scalable approaches for increasing the context size beyond single accelerator leverage distributed training, splitting the computations and memory allocations across multiple devices. In particular, the context parallelism (Li et al., 2022; 2023b; Jacobs et al., 2023) family of methods (also known as sequence parallelism) focuses on sharding model operations across the sequence axis. These methods enable effective scaling in context length with the number of accelerators, but the activation memory per device still scales linearly with the sequence length. Therefore, at very long sequence lengths (>2M), the activation memory starts to become bottleneck, limiting the training capacity. In this paper, we propose UPipe, context parallelism method that focuses on improving the memory efficiency of long-context training while maintaining the performance on par with current approaches. Our method is designed on the principle that for long-context training, processing subset of heads at once is enough to saturate the GPU. Therefore, serializing the execution in the attention layer by grouping heads into smaller chunks allows for much better memory reuse. UPipe is agnostic to the underlying attention Untied Ulysses: Memory-Efficient Context Parallelism via Headwise Chunking Figure 2. Memory usage breakdown when training Llama3-8B with sequence length of 3M tokens across 8 H100 GPUs. AC stands for Activation Checkpointing, AO denotes AC with offloading, OOM stands for Out of Memory. algorithm: similarly to DeepSpeed Ulysses, it uses the same kernels to compute attention as non-distributed training. On Llama 3-8B, our method is able to fit context lengths of up to 5 million tokens on single H100 node, and up to 8M on two H100 nodes with unified sequence parallelism (Fang & Zhao, 2024), outperforming prior works by 25% and 33% respectively in terms of maximum context length supported. At the same time, UPipes training throughput is comparable to other context parallelism techniques. Our contributions are as follows: 1. We propose UPipe, new context parallelism method that executes the attention layer in multiple stages, processing attention heads in chunks. This method is easy to implement and can work as plug-and-play replacement for existing techniques. 2. We analyze the memory usage of long-context Transformer training, identifying the major bottleneck left unaddressed by prior works and showing how UPipe mitigates this bottleneck. 3. We present GQA-compatible schedule for UPipe, which processes heads out of order to avoid redundant communication while retaining the memory benefits of standard GQA architecture. 4. We compare UPipe with prior approaches to contextparallel training, measuring the speed and memory usage for 8B and 32B dense Transformer models across sequence lengths ranging from 128k to 5M tokens1. UPipe can support longer sequence lengths (up to 5 million tokens on single 8H100 node) with negligible performance differences compared to other techniques. 1The code for our experiments is available at github.com/togethercomputer/Untied-Ulysses. 2. Background Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing textual information and solving wide variety of tasks. The research community has also become significantly interested in improving the long context understanding abilities of Transformer-based models for various use cases, such as voice (Yang et al., 2024) and video generation (Sand.ai et al., 2025). However, the paradigm of using regular selfattention for long-sequence data has several obstacles to further scaling. For instance, Team Wan et al. (2025) mention that the memory bottleneck due to activation memory when training 14B Diffusion Transformer on sequence length of "

Abstract LaS-Comp presents a zero-shot 3D shape completion method using 3D foundation models with a two-stage approach for faithful reconstruction and seamless boundary refinement.  					AI-generated summary This paper introduces LaS-Comp, a zero-shot and category-agnostic approach that leverages the rich geometric priors of 3D foundation models to enable 3D shape completion across diverse types of partial observations. Our contributions are threefold: First,  harnesses these powerful generative priors for completion through a complementary two-stage design: (i) an explicit replacement stage that preserves the partial observation geometry to ensure faithful completion; and (ii) an implicit refinement stage ensures seamless boundaries between the observed and synthesized regions. Second, our framework is training-free and compatible with different 3D foundation models. Third, we introduce Omni-Comp, a comprehensive benchmark combining real-world and synthetic data with diverse and challenging partial patterns, enabling a more thorough and realistic evaluation. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/DavidYan2001/LaS-Comp{LaS-Comp}.

Abstract UPipe enables efficient processing of long sequences in Transformer models through fine-grained chunking at the attention head level, significantly reducing activation memory usage while maintaining training speed.  					AI-generated summary Efficiently processing long sequences with Transformer models usually requires splitting the computations across accelerators via context parallelism. The dominant approaches in this family of methods, such as Ring Attention or DeepSpeed Ulysses, enable scaling over the context dimension but do not focus on memory efficiency, which limits the sequence lengths they can support. More advanced techniques, such as Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer or activation offloading, can further extend the possible context length at the cost of training throughput. In this paper, we present UPipe, a simple yet effective context parallelism technique that performs fine-grained chunking at the attention head level. This technique significantly reduces the activation memory usage of self-attention, breaking the activation memory barrier and unlocking much longer context lengths. Our approach reduces intermediate tensor memory usage in the attention layer by as much as 87.5% for 32B Transformers, while matching previous context parallelism techniques in terms of training speed. UPipe can support the context length of 5M tokens when training Llama3-8B on a single 8timesH100 node, improving upon prior methods by over 25%.

Abstract TextPecker enhances visual text rendering by addressing structural anomalies through a reinforcement learning approach that improves text-to-image generation quality and fidelity.  					AI-generated summary Visual Text Rendering (VTR) remains a critical challenge in text-to-image generation, where even advanced models frequently produce text with structural anomalies such as distortion, blurriness, and misalignment. However, we find that leading MLLMs and specialist OCR models largely fail to perceive these structural anomalies, creating a critical bottleneck for both VTR evaluation and RL-based optimization. As a result, even state-of-the-art generators (e.g., SeedDream4.0, Qwen-Image) still struggle to render structurally faithful text. To address this, we propose TextPecker, a plug-and-play structural anomaly perceptive RL strategy that mitigates noisy reward signals and works with any textto-image generator. To enable this capability, we construct a recognition dataset with character-level structural-anomaly annotations and develop a stroke-editing synthesis engine to expand structural-error coverage. Experiments show that TextPecker consistently improves diverse text-to-image models; even on the well-optimized Qwen-Image, it significantly yields average gains of 4% in structural fidelity and 8.7% in semantic alignment for Chinese text rendering, establishing a new state-of-the-art in high-fidelity VTR. Our work fills a gap in VTR optimization, providing a foundational step towards reliable and structural faithful visual text generation.

Abstract Flow-based language models outperform discrete diffusion models in both quality and speed by using Euclidean denoising over one-hot token encodings with improved training stability through time reparameterization.  					AI-generated summary Language models based on discrete diffusion have attracted widespread interest for their potential to provide faster generation than autoregressive models. In practice, however, they exhibit a sharp degradation of sample quality in the few-step regime, failing to realize this promise. Here we show that language models leveraging flow-based continuous denoising can outperform discrete diffusion in both quality and speed. By revisiting the fundamentals of flows over discrete modalities, we build a flow-based language model (FLM) that performs Euclidean denoising over one-hot token encodings. We show that the model can be trained by predicting the clean data via a cross entropy objective, where we introduce a simple time reparameterization that greatly improves training stability and generation quality. By distilling FLM into its associated flow map, we obtain a distilled flow map language model (FMLM) capable of few-step generation. On the LM1B and OWT language datasets, FLM attains generation quality matching state-of-the-art discrete diffusion models. With FMLM, our approach outperforms recent few-step language models across the board, with one-step generation exceeding their 8-step quality. Our work calls into question the widely held hypothesis that discrete diffusion processes are necessary for generative modeling over discrete modalities, and paves the way toward accelerated flow-based language modeling at scale.
