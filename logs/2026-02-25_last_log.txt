Text:"Communication-Inspired Tokenization for Structured Image Representations Aram Davtyan 1 Yusuf Sahin 1 Yasaman Haghighi 2 Sebastian Stapf 1 Pablo Acuaviva 1 Alexandre Alahi 2 Paolo Favaro 1 Abstract Discrete image tokenizers have emerged as key component of modern vision and multimodal systems, providing sequential interface for transformer-based architectures. However, most existing approaches remain primarily optimized for reconstruction and compression, often yielding tokens that capture local texture rather than object-level semantic structure. Inspired by the incremental and compositional nature of human communication, we introduce COMmunication inspired Tokenization (COMiT), novel framework for learning structured discrete visual token sequences. COMiT constructs latent message within fixed token budget by iteratively observing localized image crops and recurrently updating its discrete representation. At each step, the model integrates new visual information while refining and reorganizing the existing token sequence. After several encoding iterations, the final message conditions flow-matching decoder that reconstructs the full image. Both encoding and decoding are implemented within single transformer model and trained end-to-end using combination of flow-matching reconstruction and semantic representation alignment losses. Our experiments demonstrate that while semantic alignment provides grounding, the proposed attentive sequential tokenization is critical for inducing interpretable, object-centric token structure and substantially improving compositional generalization and relational reasoning over prior methods. 6 2 0 2 4 2 ] .

Abstract COMiT framework learns structured discrete visual tokens through iterative encoding and flow-matching decoding, improving object-centric representation and compositional generalization.  					AI-generated summary Discrete image tokenizers have emerged as a key component of modern vision and multimodal systems, providing a sequential interface for transformer-based architectures. However, most existing approaches remain primarily optimized for reconstruction and compression, often yielding tokens that capture local texture rather than object-level semantic structure. Inspired by the incremental and compositional nature of human communication, we introduce COMmunication inspired Tokenization (COMiT), a framework for learning structured discrete visual token sequences. COMiT constructs a latent message within a fixed token budget by iteratively observing localized image crops and recurrently updating its discrete representation. At each step, the model integrates new visual information while refining and reorganizing the existing token sequence. After several encoding iterations, the final message conditions a flow-matching decoder that reconstructs the full image. Both encoding and decoding are implemented within a single transformer model and trained end-to-end using a combination of flow-matching reconstruction and semantic representation alignment losses. Our experiments demonstrate that while semantic alignment provides grounding, attentive sequential tokenization is critical for inducing interpretable, object-centric token structure and substantially improving compositional generalization and relational reasoning over prior methods.
