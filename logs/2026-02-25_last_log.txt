Yet, prevailing VisionLanguage Model (VLM) evaluations still center on structureagnostic, single-turn setups (e.g., VQA), which fail to assess agents ability to reason about how geometry, contact, and support relations jointly constrain what actions are possible in dynamic environment. To address this gap, we introduce the Causal Hierarchy of Actions and Interactions (CHAIN) benchmark, an interactive 3D, physics-driven testbed designed to evaluate whether models can understand, plan, and execute structured action sequences grounded in physical constraints. CHAIN shifts evaluation from passive perception to active problem solving, spanning tasks such as interlocking mechanical puzzles and causal-chain manipulation. We conduct comprehensive study of state-ofthe-art VLMs and diffusion-based models under unified interactive settings. Our results show that top-performing models still struggle to internalize physical structure and causal constraints, often failing to produce reliable long-horizon plans and cannot robustly translate perceived structure into effective actions.

Success in such settings depends on tightly coupling perception, action, and iterative feedback over multiple steps, rather than on static scene understanding alone (Kim et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2025b). In these scenarios, the central challenge shifts from recognizing what is present to anticipating what actions are feasible, as feasibility is jointly determined by geometric structure, interfacial contacts, and multi-body support relations (Cheng et al., 2025; Li et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2023). Given these requirements, an important question is whether existing evaluation protocols adequately capture such interactive, constraint-driven reasoning. However, current evaluations for VisionLanguage Model (VLM) remain largely centered on static, single-turn formats such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), where performance is measured From Perception to Action: An Interactive Benchmark for Vision Reasoning by the correctness of final textual answer (Agrawal et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2022; He et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2024; Lyu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Guo et al., 2024; Xu et al.). While effective for diagnosing recognition and factual grounding, these benchmarksby remaining largely static and single-turnleave untested the agents ability to plan and adapt actions as constraints evolve, including whether it can anticipate how early choices will constrain (or preserve) the feasible action space later on; as result, they tend to underestimate the difficulty of physical reasoning in interactive scenarios (Cheng et al., 2025). In particular, they do not evaluate whether an agent can reason about how early actions constrainor preserve future feasible action spaces. Alongside VLMs, diffusion-based models have been explored as another paradigm for reasoning and planning. However, existing evaluations of such approaches predominantly focus on simplified 2D environments that sidestep the challenges introduced by 3D geometry, contact constraints, and support relations (Taufeeque et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2025). As result, it remains unclear whether either modern VLMs or diffusion models can reliably solve structured 3D physical problems whose feasibility is governed by hidden geometric constraints and contact-driven dependencies. To address this gap, we introduce CHAIN (Causal Hierarchy of Actions and Interactions), an interactive 3D benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can understand, plan, and execute structured action sequences grounded in physical constraints. CHAIN reorients evaluation from passive perception to active problem solving in physicsengine-driven environment1, where models must iteratively observe the environment, select feasible interactions, and revise their plans based on intermediate outcomes. CHAIN comprises task families that stress complementary aspects of structured physical reasoning: (1) Interlocking mechanical puzzles, which probe constraintaware reasoning over tightly coupled 3D objects, including contact-rich dependencies, non-intuitive feasible motions, and hidden geometric constraints; (2) 3D stacking and packing, which assess maintaining global feasibility over long horizons and stability reasoning under gravity, including support relations, balance constraints, and feasible assembly orders for stable configurations. Cross two families, these tasks emphasize structure-sensitive decision making: correct actions depend on understanding how geometry and constraints restrict what can be done next. We conduct comprehensive empirical study of state-ofthe-art VLMs and diffusion-based models under unified interactive setting. Our results indicate that current models have difficulty internalizing physical structure and constraint 1Our physics environment is implemented with Unity (Unity Technologies, 2023; Juliani et al., 2020). dependencies, often fail to maintain coherent multi-step strategies, and do not robustly translate perceived structure into effective actions over extended i"

We introduce PyVision-RL, reinforcement learning framework for open-weight multimodal models that stabilizes training and sustains interaction. Our approach combines an oversamplingfilteringranking rollout strategy with an accumulative tool reward to prevent collapse and encourage multi-turn tool use. Using unified training pipeline, we develop PyVision-Image and PyVision-Video for image and video understanding. For video reasoning, PyVisionVideo employs on-demand context construction, selectively sampling task-relevant frames during reasoning to significantly reduce visual token usage. Experiments show strong performance and improved efficiency, demonstrating that sustained interaction and on-demand visual processing are critical for scalable multimodal agents. Code, data and models are released at https://github. com/agents-x-project/PyVision-RL 1. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from passive chatbots into actionable agents capable of multiturn interaction and tool use. Beyond proprietary systems, growing body of research has explored how to endow openweight models with tool-using capabilities, particularly for tasks such as deep research and computer use that require sustained interaction with external environments. More recently, this agentic paradigm has been extended from purely textual domains to multimodal reasoning. *Core Contributor Corresponding Author Project Lead 1Shanghai AI Lab 2UMD 3CUHK 4THU 5Shanda AI Research, Tokyo 6Rice University. Correspondence Chen Wei <cw220@rice.edu>, Kaipeng Zhang to: <kaipeng.zhang@shanda.com>. Preprint. February 25, 2026. 1 Works such as OpenAI o3 (OpenAI, 2025) demonstrate that incorporating tool use into visual understanding can ground multimodal reasoning in task-relevant visual evidence, enabling models to actively manipulate visual inputs rather than passively consume them. This motivates the development of multimodal agents that reason, act, and interact over images and videos. Existing approaches to multimodal tool use largely follow two design paradigms. One line of work relies on static toolsets, where fixed set of task-specific tools, such as cropping, zooming, or video clipping, is manually predefined and exposed to the model (Hu et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2023; Gupta & Kembhavi, 2023; Zhang et al., 2025a; Yang et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2025b; Meng et al., 2025b). While effective for specific tasks, these approaches lack flexibility and require task-dependent engineering. An alternative paradigm, dynamic tooling, treats Python as primitive tool, allowing the model to synthesize task-specific operations on the fly (Zhao et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025b; Hong et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025b). This approach enables expressive and compositional tool use, but has so far remained largely limited to image understanding and often relies on proprietary APIs, leaving open-weight multimodal RL underexplored, especially for video. key challenge in training such agentic multimodal models lies in training stability and avoding interaction collapse. Prior work observes that after RL fine-tuning, models tend to reduce tool usage, converging to short, low-interaction behaviors (Zhang et al., 2025b; Hong et al., 2025). This has led to skepticism about the effectiveness of test-time interaction scaling for agentic visual understanding, in contrast to its success in textual reasoning (Jaech et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025a). We argue that this limitation does not reflect an inherent weakness of interaction, but rather insufficient training incentives and unstable rollout selection during RL. In this paper, we present an agentic training framework, PyVision-RL, for open-weight multimodal models that addresses these challenges. We adopt Python as primitive tool to enable dynamic tooling for both image and video understanding, and apply reinforcement learning with two key innovations: (1) an oversamplingfilteringranking framework for rollout generation PyVision-RL: Forging Open Agentic Vision Models via RL Figure 1. Agentic scaffolds of PyVision-RL. We design two agentic scaffolds for image and video understanding under unified framework of dynamic tooling with Python. For PyVision-Image, both the system prompt and image hints are injected into the MLLM context, and the images are also loaded into the Python runtime. For PyVision-Video, only the system prompt is injected into the MLLM context, while the video is loaded exclusively into the runtime environment. Given query, the model interleaves reasoning with executable code blocks (code_block_0) to process multimodal inputs. Execution results (mm_clue_0), including textual outputs and rendered images, are appended to the context and fed back to the model. This interaction loop repeats until final answer is produced. By restricting video inputs first to the runtime, PyVision-Video enables on-demand context construction, where the agent selectively samples and plots task-relevant frames during reasoning, substantially improving visual token efficiency  (Fig. 2)  . that stabilizes agentenvironment interaction, and (2) an accumulative tool reward that explicitly incentivizes sustained multi-turn tool usage. Using unified training pipeline, we introduce two models: PyVision-Image for image understanding and PyVision-Video for video understanding. Especially, PyVision-Video employs on-demand context construction, where the full video is loaded only into the Python runtime, and the model selectively samples and plots task-relevant frames via Python code during the reasoning process. This agentic frame fetching strategy avoids uniform frame sampling, substantially reducing visual token consumption while improving reasoning efficiency. Our models achieve strong empirical results. PyVisionImage attains state-of-the-art performance on visual search, multimodal reasoning, and agentic reasoning benchmarks, outperforming prior methods such as DeepEyes-v2 (Hong et al., 2025) by +6.9% on V* (Wu & Xie, 2024) and +9.6% on WeMath (Qiao et al., 2025a).

We address this gap through systematic study of data engineering practices for terminal agents, making two key contributions: (1) Terminal-Task-Gen, lightweight synthetic task generation pipeline that supports seed-based and skill-based task construction, and (2) comprehensive analysis of data and training strategies, including filtering, curriculum learning, long context training, and scaling behavior. Our pipeline yields Terminal-Corpus, large-scale open-source dataset for terminal tasks. Using this dataset, we train Nemotron-Terminal, family of models initialized from Qwen3(8B, 14B, 32B) that achieve substantial gains on Terminal-Bench 2.0: Nemotron-Terminal-8B improves from 2.5% to 13.0% Nemotron-Terminal-14B improves from 4.0% to 20.2%, and Nemotron-Terminal-32B improves from 3.4% to 27.4%, matching the performance of significantly larger models. To accelerate research in this domain, we open-source our model checkpoints and most of our synthetic datasets at https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-terminal. Figure 1: Overview of Terminal-Task-Gen. Our framework combines Dataset Adaptation, which transforms existing benchmarks into terminal prompts, with Synthetic Task Generation, which uses seed data and Skill Taxonomy to construct targeted scenarios. The tasks from both streams are utilized during Trajectory Generation phase, where agents interact with Dockerized environments to produce solution traces, followed by Post-Processing (decontamination and filtering) to yield the final SFT dataset. 1.

Open Source Models 2025) demonstrate the potential of command-line proficiency, with frontier models showing promising results on benchmarks such as Terminal-Bench (Merrill et al., 2026). However, the training data mixtures behind these systems remain largely undisclosed, leaving fundamental questions about effective data design unanswered. This lack of transparency forces researchers into costly trial-and-error process, primarily due to two significant bottlenecks in agentic data generation: (1) the scarcity of foundational resources, including diverse task prompts, requisite dependency files, and pre-configured environments; and (2) the logistical complexity of trajectory collection, as real-world human interactions are difficult to capture, while synthetic generation via LLM agents is prohibitively expensive due to the need for fresh environment instantiation and multi-turn interaction for every task. Current approaches to improving terminal capabilities fall into two main categories: improving agentic scaffolds (Antigma, 2025; Internet, 2025; JetBrains, 2025; Letta, 2025; Mux, 2025; Nichols, 2025; Singhal et al., 2025) or improving the underlying model for terminal use (Anthropic, 2025; DeepMind, 2025; Liu et al., 2025; MiniMax, 2025; Moonshot AI, 2025; OpenAI, 2025). One prominent approach for post-training models involves using adapters that wrap existing datasets in command-line interfaces (DCAgent, 2025; Development, 2025,). While the Terminal-Bench authors provide repository of such adapters (Team, 2025) primarily for benchmark adaptation, these adapters can also be repurposed as starting point for scaling training data. However, adapters inherit structural assumptions from source datasets never designed for sequential environment interaction, potentially limiting their effectiveness. Recent work has explored multi-agent frameworks (Austin, 2025; Peng et al., 2025) for more principled data generation, but these introduce computational complexity that scales poorly for large-scale training. The field thus lacks practical framework that balances generation efficiency with the specific requirements of training effective terminal agents. We address this gap through dual-strategy approach that combines dataset adaptation with synthetic task generation. Dataset adaptation provides broad coverage by transforming existing math, code, and software engineering datasets into Terminal-Bench format, efficiently scaling data volume while leveraging high-quality problem sources. Synthetic task generation offers finer-grained control: it enables targeted development of terminal-specific skills with control over task characteristics, such as difficulty, domain coverage, and primitive skill composition. These strategies are complementary and address distinct bottlenecks: adapters make the most of existing datasets to build foundational terminal capabilities at scale, while synthetic task generation provides the flexibility to target specific capability gaps. Building on this coarse-to-fine data generation pipeline, we develop Nemotron-Terminal, family of models fine-tuned from Qwen3 models (Yang et al., 2025). Specifically, we make the following contributions: 1. We introduce Terminal-Task-Gen, scalable synthetic task generation pipeline that enables rapid exploration of task design and targeted generation for specific skills with different difficulty levels. 2. We conduct systematic study of data engineering strategies, examining filtering strategies for dataset adapters and synthetic tasks, curriculum learning for data mixing, long context training, and scaling trends. 3. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our curated dataset. As demonstrated in Table 1, on Terminal-Bench 2.0, our models achieve substantial improvements over the 2"

Drawing upon human reflective practitioners, we introduce Reflective Test-Time Planning, which integrates two modes of reflection: reflection-inaction, where the agent uses test-time scaling to generate and score multiple candidate actions using internal reflections before execution; and reflection-on-action, which uses test-time training to update both its internal reflection model and its action policy based on external reflections after execution. We also include retrospective reflection, allowing the agent to re-evaluate earlier decisions and perform model updates with hindsight for proper long-horizon credit assignment. Experiments on our newly-designed Long-Horizon Household benchmark and MuJoCo Cupboard Fitting benchmark show significant gains over baseline models, with ablative studies validating the complementary roles of reflection-in-action 1Stanford University 2Northwestern University.

Qualitative analyses, including real-robot trials, highlight behavioral correction through reflection. Error isnt simple darkness, it sheds light of its Kathryn Schulz, Being Wrong own. 1. Introduction Embodied LLMs (Zitkovich et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2024; Hong et al., 2024) equip agents with task planning abilities, but they remain brittle static oracles that cannot learn from failures, turning deployment into independent trials of repeated mistakes rather than accumulated experience. Humans, in contrast, are natural reflective practitioners. Drawing on Schons framework about reflective planning (Schon, 1992), humans fluidly alternate between two modes of reflection: through reflection-in-action, we engage in internal simulation, questioning whether our planned approach will actually work given what we currently understand; through reflection-on-action, we use the actual outcomes to reshape both our beliefs about the environment and our strategies for acting within it. An illustrative example of these reflection modes is shown in Figure 1. This bidirectional flow allows us to learn not only from outcomes, but also from the very process of engaging with an uncertain world. Current approaches, however, capture at best superficial version of one mode while neglecting the other. One line Learning from Trials and Errors: Reflective Test-Time Planning for Embodied LLMs of work (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023) uses LLM-based verbal reflection, generating natural-language critiques of past behavior to condition future actions. While this enables reflection-on-action at the level of reasoning traces, reflections are stored only as contextual text and do not update the underlying decision process, making their effects transient and prone to repetition under distributional shift. second line of work (Zhen et al., 2024; Feng et al., 2025) relies on internal world models to guide action selection in embodied environments. These approaches support reflection-in-action through anticipated outcomes, but typically assume fixed, pretrained dynamics models that may be wrong in ways only revealed during execution. To operationalize both reflection modes in embodied settings, we introduce Reflective Test-Time Planning, framework that seamlessly unifies reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action for embodied agents during test-time deployment. Concretely, the framework employs three embodied LLMs during deployment: an action generation model πθ, an internal evaluator Vϕi, and an external evaluator Vϕe. During reflection-in-action, the agent samples candidate actions via high-temperature sampling, uses Vϕi to generate internal reflections scoring each candidate, then executes the highest-scoring action. After execution, Vϕe generates an external reflection, providing an immediate, language-based evaluation of what happened and why. This immediate external reflection grounds the agents beliefs in reality, but remains inherently localit only evaluates consequences visible at the next timestep. Yet many embodied failures are non-local: an action that appears successful may later block progress, and seemingly suboptimal action may enable future success. To address this temporal credit assignment problem, we introduce retrospective reflection, where Vϕe periodically re-evaluates earlier decisions with hindsight (e.g., at room transitions or after repeated failures). These hindsight assessments provide selfsupervised signals at deployment time, enabling two forms of test-time training: (1) policy gradient for πθ to favor actions that score well under hindsight, and (2) supervised learning for Vϕi to anticipate what hindsight will reveal. Because these updates revise not only the action policy but also the predictive assumptions behind it, the process constitutes form of double-loop learning (Argyris, 1977), in which agents learn not merely from outcomes but from diagnosing and correcting the underlying causes of their errors. We evaluate our approach on two embodied benchmarks that we design to stress error-driven adaptation: (1) LongHorizon Household benchmark that requires failure recovery during multi-step planning across rooms, and (2) controlled MuJoCo Cupboard Fitting benchmark that isolates geometric placement failures. Our framework achieves large gains over reflective language, RL and world-model baselines. Ablations indicate that improvement emerges only when both reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action take place, and "

This exacerbates head-of-line (HoL) blocking during the compute-intensive prefill phase, where longrunning requests monopolize resources and delay higher-priority ones, leading to widespread time-to-first-token (TTFT) SLO violations. While chunked prefill enables interruptibility, it introduces an inherent trade-off between responsiveness and throughput: reducing chunk size improves response latency but degrades computational efficiency, whereas increasing chunk size maximizes throughput but exacerbates blocking. This necessitates an adaptive preemption mechanism. However, dynamically balancing execution granularity against scheduling overheads remains key challenge. In this paper, we propose FlowPrefill, TTFT-goodput-optimized serving system that resolves this conflict by decoupling preemption granularity from scheduling frequency. To achieve adaptive prefill scheduling, FlowPrefill introduces two key innovations: 1) OperatorLevel Preemption, which leverages operator boundaries to enable fine-grained execution interruption without the efficiency loss associated with fixed small chunking; and 2) Event-Driven Scheduling, which triggers scheduling decisions only upon reques"

[ 1 4 2 4 0 2 . 2 0 6 2 : r Implicit Intelligence - Evaluating Agents on What Users Dont Say Ved Sirdeshmukh, Marc Wetter Applied Machine Learning Research {vsirdeshmukh, mwetter}@labelbox.com Real-world requests to AI agents are fundamentally underspecified. Natural human communication relies on shared context and unstated constraints that speakers expect listeners to infer. Current agentic benchmarks test explicit instruction-following but fail to evaluate whether agents can reason about implicit requirements spanning accessibility needs, privacy boundaries, catastrophic risks, and contextual constraints. We present Implicit Intelligence, an evaluation framework testing whether AI agents can move beyond prompt-following to become genuine goal-fulfillers, paired with Agent-as-a-World (AaW), harness where interactive worlds are defined in human-readable YAML files and simulated by language models. Our scenarios feature apparent simplicity in user requests, hidden complexity in correct solutions, and discoverability of constraints through environmental exploration. Evaluating 16 frontier and open-weight models across 205 scenarios, we find that even the best-performing model achieves only 48.3% scenario pass rate, revealing substantial room for improvement in bridging the gap between literal instruction-following and human-like contextual reasoning. The gap between what users say and what they mean represents fundamental challenge in deploying AI agents. Natural communication is inherently underspecified: speakers rely on shared context, implicit assumptions, and unstated constraints they expect listeners to infer. simple request often carries invisible requirements that, if violated, render any technically correct solution useless or harmful. Current benchmarks have driven progress in explicit instruction-following and tool use, testing whether agents can navigate websites, write code, and execute multi-step plans.

CHAIN shifts evaluation from passive perception to active problem solving, spanning tasks such as interlocking mechanical puzzles and 3D stacking and packing. We conduct a comprehensive study of state-of-the-art VLMs and diffusion-based models under unified interactive settings.

"Abstract Current vision-language models lack capability to understand physical structures and causal constraints needed for complex, interactive 3D tasks, as demonstrated by the CHAIN benchmark evaluating structured action planning under physical constraints.  					AI-generated summary Understanding the physical structure is essential for real-world applications such as embodied agents, interactive design, and long-horizon manipulation. Yet, prevailing Vision-Language Model (VLM) evaluations still center on structure-agnostic, single-turn setups (e.g., VQA), which fail to assess agents' ability to reason about how geometry, contact, and support relations jointly constrain what actions are possible in a dynamic environment. To address this gap, we introduce the Causal Hierarchy of Actions and Interactions (CHAIN) benchmark, an interactive 3D, physics-driven testbed designed to evaluate whether models can understand, plan, and execute structured action sequences grounded in physical constraints. CHAIN shifts evaluation from passive perception to active problem solving, spanning tasks such as interlocking mechanical puzzles and 3D stacking and packing. We conduct a comprehensive study of state-of-the-art VLMs and diffusion-based models under unified interactive settings.

Abstract PyVision-RL framework addresses interaction collapse in multimodal models through enhanced reinforcement learning techniques and efficient video processing strategies.  					AI-generated summary Reinforcement learning for agentic multimodal models often suffers from interaction collapse, where models learn to reduce tool usage and multi-turn reasoning, limiting the benefits of agentic behavior. We introduce PyVision-RL, a reinforcement learning framework for open-weight multimodal models that stabilizes training and sustains interaction. Our approach combines an oversampling-filtering-ranking rollout strategy with an accumulative tool reward to prevent collapse and encourage multi-turn tool use. Using a unified training pipeline, we develop PyVision-Image and PyVision-Video for image and video understanding. For video reasoning, PyVision-Video employs on-demand context construction, selectively sampling task-relevant frames during reasoning to significantly reduce visual token usage. Experiments show strong performance and improved efficiency, demonstrating that sustained interaction and on-demand visual processing are critical for scalable multimodal agents.

Abstract LongCLI-Bench evaluates AI agents' ability to complete complex, multi-step programming tasks through command-line interfaces with detailed failure analysis and human-agent collaboration insights.  					AI-generated summary Recent advances in AI-assisted programming have empowered agents to execute complex workflows via command-line interfaces, however, existing benchmarks are limited by short task horizons, data contamination from GitHub scraping, and a lack of fine-grained evaluation metrics, fail to rigorously evaluate the long-horizon planning and execution capabilities essential for realistic software engineering. To address these gaps, we introduce LongCLI-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate agentic capabilities across long-horizon, realistic tasks. We curated 20 high-quality, long-horizon tasks from over 1,000 computer science assignments and real-world workflows, covering four engineering categories: from scratch, feature addition, bug fixing, and refactoring. We propose a dual-set testing protocol for LongCLI-Bench, which measures requirement fulfillment (fail-to-pass) and regression avoidance (pass-to-pass), and incorporates step-level scoring to pinpoint execution failures. Extensive experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents achieve pass rates below 20% in LongCLI-Bench. Step-level analysis further indicates that the majority of tasks stall at less than 30% completion, highlighting that critical failures often occur in the early stages. Although self-correction offers marginal gains, human-agent collaboration through plan injection and interactive guidance yields significantly higher improvements. These results highlight that future research must emphasize the development of synergistic human-agent workflows alongside advances in agents' planning and execution capabilities to overcome key challenges in long-horizon task performance.

Abstract Researchers developed a synthetic task generation pipeline and analyzed data strategies to improve terminal agent performance, creating a large-scale dataset and models that outperform larger counterparts on benchmark tests.  					AI-generated summary Despite rapid recent progress in the terminal capabilities of large language models, the training data strategies behind state-of-the-art terminal agents remain largely undisclosed. We address this gap through a systematic study of data engineering practices for terminal agents, making two key contributions: (1) Terminal-Task-Gen, a lightweight synthetic task generation pipeline that supports seed-based and skill-based task construction, and (2) a comprehensive analysis of data and training strategies, including filtering, curriculum learning, long context training, and scaling behavior. Our pipeline yields Terminal-Corpus, a large-scale open-source dataset for terminal tasks. Using this dataset, we train Nemotron-Terminal, a family of models initialized from Qwen3(8B, 14B, 32B) that achieve substantial gains on Terminal-Bench 2.0: Nemotron-Terminal-8B improves from 2.5% to 13.0% Nemotron-Terminal-14B improves from 4.0% to 20.2%, and Nemotron-Terminal-32B improves from 3.4% to 27.4%, matching the performance of significantly larger models. To accelerate research in this domain, we open-source our model checkpoints and most of our synthetic datasets at https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-terminal.

Abstract A new conversational financial recommendation benchmark evaluates large language models' ability to balance rational decision-making with user behavior alignment using multi-view references derived from real market data and human decision trajectories.  					AI-generated summary Most recommendation benchmarks evaluate how well a model imitates user behavior. In financial advisory, however, observed actions can be noisy or short-sighted under market volatility and may conflict with a user's long-term goals. Treating what users chose as the sole ground truth, therefore, conflates behavioral imitation with decision quality. We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise. The dataset is publicly released on Hugging Face, and the codebase is available on GitHub.

Бенчмарк использует мульти-референтные разметки на основе реальных данных рынка и человеческих траекторий решений, что позволяет различать настоящее поведение от нормативной полезности.

Abstract Reflective Test-Time Planning enhances robot decision-making by integrating multiple reflection mechanisms that enable learning from experience and improving long-horizon task performance.  					AI-generated summary Embodied LLMs endow robots with high-level task reasoning, but they cannot reflect on what went wrong or why, turning deployment into a sequence of independent trials where mistakes repeat rather than accumulate into experience. Drawing upon human reflective practitioners, we introduce Reflective Test-Time Planning, which integrates two modes of reflection: reflection-in-action, where the agent uses test-time scaling to generate and score multiple candidate actions using internal reflections before execution; and reflection-on-action, which uses test-time training to update both its internal reflection model and its action policy based on external reflections after execution. We also include retrospective reflection, allowing the agent to re-evaluate earlier decisions and perform model updates with hindsight for proper long-horizon credit assignment. Experiments on our newly-designed Long-Horizon Household benchmark and MuJoCo Cupboard Fitting benchmark show significant gains over baseline models, with ablative studies validating the complementary roles of reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action. Qualitative analyses, including real-robot trials, highlight behavioral correction through reflection.

Abstract FlowPrefill addresses head-of-line blocking in large language model serving by decoupling preemption granularity from scheduling frequency through operator-level preemption and event-driven scheduling, achieving up to 5.6x better goodput than existing systems.  					AI-generated summary The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) requires serving systems to handle many concurrent requests with diverse service level objectives (SLOs). This exacerbates head-of-line (HoL) blocking during the compute-intensive prefill phase, where long-running requests monopolize resources and delay higher-priority ones, leading to widespread time-to-first-token (TTFT) SLO violations. While chunked prefill enables interruptibility, it introduces an inherent trade-off between responsiveness and throughput: reducing chunk size improves response latency but degrades computational efficiency, whereas increasing chunk size maximizes throughput but exacerbates blocking. This necessitates an adaptive preemption mechanism. However, dynamically balancing execution granularity against scheduling overheads remains a key challenge.   In this paper, we propose FlowPrefill, a TTFT-goodput-optimized serving system that resolves this conflict by decoupling preemption granularity from scheduling frequency. To achieve adaptive prefill scheduling, FlowPrefill introduces two key innovations: 1) Operator-Level Preemption, which leverages operator boundaries to enable fine-grained execution interruption without the efficiency loss associated with fixed small chunking; and 2) Event-Driven Scheduling, which triggers scheduling decisions only upon request arrival or completion events, thereby supporting efficient preemption responsiveness while minimizing control-plane overhead. Evaluation on real-world production traces shows that FlowPrefill improves maximum goodput by up to 5.6times compared to state-of-the-art systems while satisfying heterogeneous SLOs.

Abstract Large language models benefit from scaled chain-of-thought reasoning through efficient training methods that balance trajectory length and accuracy using reinforcement learning with reward shaping.  					AI-generated summary Large Language Models (LLMs) consistently benefit from scaled Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but also suffer from heavy computational overhead. To address this issue, efficient reasoning aims to incentivize short yet accurate thinking trajectories, typically through reward shaping with Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we systematically investigate the mechanics of efficient reasoning for LLMs. For comprehensive evaluation, we advocate for more fine-grained metrics, including length distribution conditioned on correctness and performance across a wide spectrum of token budgets ranging from 2k to 32k. First, we reveal that the training process follows a two-stage paradigm: length adaptation and reasoning refinement. After that, we conduct extensive experiments (about 0.2 million GPU hours) in a unified protocol, deconstructing training prompts and rollouts, reward shaping, and optimization strategies. In particular, a key finding is to train on relatively easier prompts, ensuring the density of positive reward signals and thus avoiding the length collapse. Meanwhile, the learned length bias can be generalized across domains. We distill all findings into valuable insights and practical guidelines, and further validate them across the Qwen3 series, ranging from 0.6B to 30B, demonstrating the robustness and generalization.

In this paper, we systematically investigate the mechanics of efficient reasoning for LLMs. For comprehensive evaluation, we advocate for more fine-grained metrics, including length distribution conditioned on correctness and performance across a wide spectrum of token budgets ranging from 2k to 32k. First, we reveal that the training process follows a two-stage paradigm: length adaptation and reasoning refinement. After that, we conduct extensive experiments (about 0.2 million GPU hours) in a unified protocol, deconstructing training prompts and rollouts, reward shaping, and optimization strategies. In particular, a key finding is to train on relatively easier prompts, ensuring the density of positive reward signals and thus avoiding the length collapse. Meanwhile, the learned length bias can be generalized across domains. We distill all findings into valuable insights and practical guidelines, and further validate them across the Qwen3 series, ranging from 0.6B to 30B, demonstrating the robustness and generalization."

Abstract AI agents struggle to interpret implicitly specified real-world requests that require contextual reasoning beyond explicit instructions, as demonstrated by an evaluation framework using interactive YAML-defined worlds.  					AI-generated summary Real-world requests to AI agents are fundamentally underspecified. Natural human communication relies on shared context and unstated constraints that speakers expect listeners to infer. Current agentic benchmarks test explicit instruction-following but fail to evaluate whether agents can reason about implicit requirements spanning accessibility needs, privacy boundaries, catastrophic risks, and contextual constraints. We present Implicit Intelligence, an evaluation framework testing whether AI agents can move beyond prompt-following to become genuine goal-fulfillers, paired with Agent-as-a-World (AaW), a harness where interactive worlds are defined in human-readable YAML files and simulated by language models. Our scenarios feature apparent simplicity in user requests, hidden complexity in correct solutions, and discoverability of constraints through environmental exploration. Evaluating 16 frontier and open-weight models across 205 scenarios, we find that even the best-performing model achieves only 48.3% scenario pass rate, revealing substantial room for improvement in bridging the gap between literal instruction-following and human-like contextual reasoning.
