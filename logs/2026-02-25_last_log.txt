[ 1 9 8 0 9 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Figure 1. Given reference human image and target SMPL mesh sequence, our method synthesizes photorealistic 3D human animation. Unlike the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (e.g., LHM [58] (top-right)) that are limited to rigid motion, our ANI3DHUMAN (bottom) can further generate high-fidelity nonrigid dynamics, capturing the natural flow of the dress.

Abstract Ani3DHuman framework combines kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors to generate photorealistic 3D human animations by addressing challenges in non-rigid motion synthesis and identity preservation.  					AI-generated summary Current 3D human animation methods struggle to achieve photorealism: kinematics-based approaches lack non-rigid dynamics (e.g., clothing dynamics), while methods that leverage video diffusion priors can synthesize non-rigid motion but suffer from quality artifacts and identity loss. To overcome these limitations, we present Ani3DHuman, a framework that marries kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors. We first introduce a layered motion representation that disentangles rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. Rigid motion is generated by a kinematic method, which then produces a coarse rendering to guide the video diffusion model in generating video sequences that restore the residual non-rigid motion. However, this restoration task, based on diffusion sampling, is highly challenging, as the initial renderings are out-of-distribution, causing standard deterministic ODE samplers to fail. Therefore, we propose a novel self-guided stochastic sampling method, which effectively addresses the out-of-distribution problem by combining stochastic sampling (for photorealistic quality) with self-guidance (for identity fidelity). These restored videos provide high-quality supervision, enabling the optimization of the residual non-rigid motion field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \MethodName can generate photorealistic 3D human animation, outperforming existing methods. Code is available in https://github.com/qiisun/ani3dhuman.
