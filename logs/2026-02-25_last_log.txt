We investigate whether large language model, guided by an evaluator and evolutionary search, can automatically discover improved lexical retrieval algorithms. We introduce RankEvolve, program evolution setup based on AlphaEvolve, in which candidate ranking algorithms are represented as executable code and iteratively mutated, recombined, and selected based on retrieval performance across 12 IR datasets from BEIR and BRIGHT. RankEvolve starts from two seed programs: BM25 and query likelihood with Dirichlet smoothing. The evolved algorithms are novel, effective, and show promising transfer to the full BEIR and BRIGHT benchmarks as well as TREC DL 19 and 20. Our results suggest that evaluator-guided LLM program evolution is practical path towards automatic discovery of novel ranking algorithms. Code is available here.

[ 1 0 2 0 9 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aDetecting LLM training data is generally framed as membership inference attack (MIA) problem. However, conventional MIAs operate passively on fixed model weights, using log-likelihoods or text generations. In this work, we introduce Active Data Reconstruction Attack (ADRA), family of MIA that actively induces model to reconstruct given text through training. We hypothesize that training data are more reconstructible than non-members, and the difference in their reconstructibility can be exploited for membership inference. Motivated by findings that reinforcement learning (RL) sharpens behaviors already encoded in weights, we leverage on-policy RL to actively elicit data reconstruction by finetuning policy initialized from the target model. To effectively use RL for MIA, we design reconstruction metrics and contrastive rewards. The resulting algorithms, ADRA and its adaptive variant ADRA+, improve both reconstruction and detection given pool of candidate data. Experiments show that our methods consistently outperform existing MIAs in detecting pre-training, posttraining, and distillation data, with an average improvement of 10.7% over the previous runner-up. In particular, ADRA+ improves over Min-K%++ by 18.8% on BookMIA for pre-training detection and by 7.6% on AIME for post-training detection. 1. Introduction Modern language models are known to memorize and regurgitate training data, raising concerns about copyright, privacy, and data contamination (Carlini et al., 2021; Ahmed et al., 2026). Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are methods that detect whether given input was present in the training data (Shokri et al., 2017), and have shown some success when applied to LLMs (Shi et al., 2023). 1University of Washington 2Cornell University 3UC Berkeley 4Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Correspondence to: Junjie Oscar Yin <osey@cs.washington.edu>. Preprint. February 24, 2026. Figure 1. Active Data Reconstruction Attack. Language model generates reconstructions from candidate prefix and is rewarded via contrastive objective. Members become easier to reconstruct than non-members over RL training, improving MIA performance. Prior MIAs query the target model without modifying its weights, passively extracting signals exposed through the output layersuch as loss (Shokri et al., 2017; Yeom et al., 2018; Carlini et al., 2021), log-probabilities (Shi et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024b), or text generations (Hallinan et al., 2025). We hypothesize that model weights encode latent membership signal that passive methods fail to reliably expose. If such signal exists, it could be actively elicited through model weight updates. We introduce Active Data Reconstruction Attack (ADRA), family of MIAs that uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) with reconstruction rewards to elicit latent membership signals. Because model weights encode traces of training data, RL training exploits the difference in member and non-member reconstructability for detection. Our approach is motivated by recent findings that RL sharpens behaviors already encoded in weights (Yue et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025) while transferring minimal new information (Schulman & Lab, 2025), suggesting RL is well-suited to surface latent reconstruction signal. Learning to Detect Language Model Training Data via Active Reconstruction Figure 1 illustrates our attack: given candidate prefix, the model generates continuations (reconstructions) and is rewarded for producing generations similar to the candidate suffix. To effectively leverage RL for MIA, we design reconstruction metrics and contrastive rewards that match generations against pool containing the true suffix and negative distractors. This yields two algorithms: ADRA, which rewards the best match among the pool, and ADRA+, which adaptively adjusts how often the true suffix should be included during matching based on prior derived from loss-based scores. Empirically, we run comprehensive experiments spanning pre-training, post-training, and distillation settings across 6 open-weight LLMs. To better match frontier models knowledge cutoffs and heavier post-training, we construct 6 new MIA datasets and evaluate on 2 established benchmarks. We find that ADRA and ADRA+ consistently outperform prior MIAs across all settings, with an average improvement of 10.7% over the previous runner-up. For pre-training data detection, on the challenging WikiMIA2024 Hard benchmarkwhere most baselines hover below randomADRA+ reaches 60.6% AUROC, outperforming Min-K%++ by 10%. For post-training, under controlled contamination on AIME, ADRA+ achieves 85.9% AUROC, improving over N-Sampling by 13.2% and Min-K%++ by 7.6%. For distillation, on prefix-matched distillation traces, ADRA attains near-perfect membership inference, reaching 98.4% under Deepseek-R1 distillation. Ablations confirm that RL-based optimization, reconstruction-reward design, and the contrastive objective are critical to these gains. Our results suggest that model weights encode more about training data than fixed outputs reveal. RL training help surface this latent information, enabling stronger reconstruction and membership inference. Codebase, models, and datasets are available at https://github.com/oseyosey/MIA-RL. 2. Background Membership inference (Shokri et al., 2017) aims to determine if datapoint was present in the training data of model θ. We focus on the specific problem of detecting training data from LLMs, which is known to be difficult (Duan et al., 2024). Notation. Let pθ be the target LLM with parameters θ, trained on dataset Dtrain. Given candidate document Dcand, write = (c, y) where is the observed prefix and is the held-out suffix. Membership inference is the binary classification problem of determining whether was drawn from Dtrain or not. Define scoring function (x; θ) that maps each candidate to scalar membership score; MIAs predict member iff (x; θ) ϵ for threshold ϵ. Loss-based Methods. Most prior MIAs score candidate by the models token-level log-probabilities on x, with the intuition that models are likely to have lower loss on sequences that have been seen during training: Loss (Yeom et al., 2018): (x) = L(x; θ). R-Loss (Carlini et al., 2021): calibrate by reference model θref , = L(x; θ) L(x; θref ). Zlib Entropy (Carlini et al., 2021): normalize by the zlib compress"

Abstract Large language models guided by evaluators and evolutionary search can automatically discover improved lexical retrieval algorithms through program evolution techniques.  					AI-generated summary Retrieval algorithms like BM25 and query likelihood with Dirichlet smoothing remain strong and efficient first-stage rankers, yet improvements have mostly relied on parameter tuning and human intuition. We investigate whether a large language model, guided by an evaluator and evolutionary search, can automatically discover improved lexical retrieval algorithms. We introduce RankEvolve, a program evolution setup based on AlphaEvolve, in which candidate ranking algorithms are represented as executable code and iteratively mutated, recombined, and selected based on retrieval performance across 12 IR datasets from BEIR and BRIGHT. RankEvolve starts from two seed programs: BM25 and query likelihood with Dirichlet smoothing. The evolved algorithms are novel, effective, and show promising transfer to the full BEIR and BRIGHT benchmarks as well as TREC DL 19 and 20. Our results suggest that evaluator-guided LLM program evolution is a practical path towards automatic discovery of novel ranking algorithms.

Abstract Active Data Reconstruction Attack uses reinforcement learning to identify training data by measuring the reconstructibility of text from model behavior, outperforming existing membership inference attacks.  					AI-generated summary Detecting LLM training data is generally framed as a membership inference attack (MIA) problem. However, conventional MIAs operate passively on fixed model weights, using log-likelihoods or text generations. In this work, we introduce Active Data Reconstruction Attack (ADRA), a family of MIA that actively induces a model to reconstruct a given text through training. We hypothesize that training data are more reconstructible than non-members, and the difference in their reconstructibility can be exploited for membership inference. Motivated by findings that reinforcement learning (RL) sharpens behaviors already encoded in weights, we leverage on-policy RL to actively elicit data reconstruction by finetuning a policy initialized from the target model. To effectively use RL for MIA, we design reconstruction metrics and contrastive rewards. The resulting algorithms, ADRA and its adaptive variant ADRA+, improve both reconstruction and detection given a pool of candidate data. Experiments show that our methods consistently outperform existing MIAs in detecting pre-training, post-training, and distillation data, with an average improvement of 10.7\% over the previous runner-up. In particular, \MethodPlus~improves over Min-K\%++ by 18.8\% on BookMIA for pre-training detection and by 7.6\% on AIME for post-training detection.
