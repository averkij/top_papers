[ 1 4 0 2 1 2 . 2 0 6 2 : r aTest-time training (TTT) with KV binding as sequence modeling layer is commonly interpreted as form of online meta-learning that memorizes keyvalue mapping at test time. However, our analysis reveals multiple phenomena that contradict this memorization-based interpretation. Motivated by these findings, we revisit the formulation of TTT and show that broad class of TTT architectures can be expressed as form of learned linear attention operator. Beyond explaining previously puzzling model behaviors, this perspective yields multiple practical benefits: it enables principled architectural simplifications, admits fully parallel formulations that preserve performance while improving efficiency, and provides systematic reduction of diverse TTT variants to standard linear attention form. Overall, our results reframe TTT not as test-time memorization, but as learned linear attention with enhanced representational capacity. 1. Introduction Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as powerful paradigm for dynamic model adaptation. Initially introduced to address distribution shift by updating model parameters on unlabeled test inputs, TTT has since evolved into distinct architectural primitive (Sun et al., 2020). Recent work has increasingly framed TTT as an alternative to standard softmax attention in transformers, offering favorable properties like linear-time compute and constant memory usage during autoregressive inference (Zhang et al., 2025; Behrouz et al., 2024). Among the various TTT formulations, this paper focuses on TTT with KV binding (Sun et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025; Han et al., 2025; Behrouz et al., 2024), which optimizes self-supervised key-value association objective in the inner loop, as opposed to end-to-end methods that backpropagate from the final task loss (Tandon et al., 2025). The prevailing interpretation of TTT casts it as 1NVIDIA 2University of Toronto 3Vector Institute 4Technion. Correspondence to: Ruilong Li <ruilongl@nvidia.com>. Preprint. February 25, 2026. 1 form of online meta-learning or memorization (Sun et al., 2025; Finn et al., 2017; Metz et al., 2018), where the inner loop dynamically constructs temporary key-value (KV) map by optimizing neural network (e.g., an MLP) on previously observed tokens. The subsequent inference step is viewed as querying this stored knowledge. This perspective has led to increased complexity in recent architectural designs, motivating the use of sophisticated optimizers, normalization schemes, and deep inner-loop networks (Zhang et al., 2025; Han et al., 2025; Behrouz et al., 2024; 2025a; Dalal et al., 2025), all explicitly designed to improve the fidelity of this memorization. The Memorization Paradox. Yet, this interpretation of TTT as test-time memorization can be directly contradicted by empirical evidence. If TTT would truly function by explicitly learning and retrieving keyvalue associations, its behavior would conform to basic principles of memory formation and optimization dynamics. Contrary to this expectation, we identify systematic anomalies that directly contradict this hypothesis: Distributional Asymmetry. Unlike standard attention, in which queries and keys share the same semantic space, converged TTT models exhibit significant distributional mismatch between queries and keys. Replacing queries with keys. Replacing queries with keys for TTT models has negligible effect on the task performance, suggesting that queries do not play functional retrieval role as in standard attention. Optimization vs. Performance. Counterintuitively, improvements in the inner loop, which can be interpreted as stronger memorization, do not guarantee better downstream performance. The Gradient Ascent Anomaly. Most strikingly, we find that replacing inner-loop gradient descent with gradient ascent always preserves, and in some cases even improves, task performance. These observations collectively challenge the prevailing view of TTT as an online meta-learning or key-value memorization mechanism. TTT is Secretly Linear Attention. Motivated by these observations, and by prior work showing that TTT reduces to linear attention in the restricted case of single linear innerTest-Time Training with KV Binding Is Secretly Linear Attention loop layer with zero initialization (Sun et al., 2025), we revisit the mathematical formulation of TTT. We show analytically that even TTT variants with complex fast-weight parameterizations (including multi-layer MLPs and momentum) can be equivalently rewritten as form of learned linear attention operator (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Under this unified view, the inner loop does not perform meta learning in the conventional sense. Instead, it induces structured, history-dependent mixing of query, key, and value vectors. This perspective resolves the empirical paradoxes identified above: gradient ascent preserves performance because sign inversions are absorbed into the learned value projection, and distributional symmetry between queries and keys is unnecessary because the mechanism operates as feature mixer rather than similaritybased retrieval system. Practical Implications. Unmasking TTT as Linear Attention is not just theoretical exercise; it unlocks significant practical benefits. By adopting this perspective, we: Simplify. We show that many components introduced in prior TTT architectures, such as weight normalization and momentum, are often redundant. Parallelize. We derive fully parallel form of TTT that achieves up to 4.0 inference throughput on attention calculation while maintaining performance. Generalize. We provide systematic reduction of diverse TTT variants to common linear attention form, suggesting that TTT is best understood as flexible learned linear attention mechanism with enhanced representational capacity which opens up an increased design space. 2. Related Work 2.1. Linear Attention Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have recently gained renewed interest as efficient alternatives to standard Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). The introduction of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) has accelerated advances in RNN-based architectures, leading to the incorporation of various mechanisms such as token-dependent decay factors (Gu et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2023; Orvieto et al., 2023; Peng et"

"Abstract Test-time training is reinterpreted as learned linear attention rather than memorization, offering architectural simplifications and improved efficiency.  					AI-generated summary Test-time training (TTT) with KV binding as sequence modeling layer is commonly interpreted as a form of online meta-learning that memorizes a key-value mapping at test time. However, our analysis reveals multiple phenomena that contradict this memorization-based interpretation. Motivated by these findings, we revisit the formulation of TTT and show that a broad class of TTT architectures can be expressed as a form of learned linear attention operator. Beyond explaining previously puzzling model behaviors, this perspective yields multiple practical benefits: it enables principled architectural simplifications, admits fully parallel formulations that preserve performance while improving efficiency, and provides a systematic reduction of diverse TTT variants to a standard linear attention form. Overall, our results reframe TTT not as test-time memorization, but as learned linear attention with enhanced representational capacity."

Abstract Discrete diffusion models with predictor-corrector samplers surpass traditional methods in generation quality and efficiency, challenging assumptions about masked diffusion's necessity in language modeling.  					AI-generated summary Uniform-state discrete diffusion models excel at few-step generation and guidance due to their ability to self-correct, making them preferred over autoregressive or Masked diffusion models in these settings. However, their sampling quality plateaus with ancestral samplers as the number of steps increases. We introduce a family of Predictor-Corrector (PC) samplers for discrete diffusion that generalize prior methods and apply to arbitrary noise processes. When paired with uniform-state diffusion, our samplers outperform ancestral sampling on both language and image modeling, achieving lower generative perplexity at matched unigram entropy on OpenWebText and better FID/IS scores on CIFAR10. Crucially, unlike conventional samplers, our PC methods continue to improve with more sampling steps. Taken together, these findings call into question the assumption that Masked diffusion is the inevitable future of diffusion-based language modeling. Beyond sampling, we develop a memory-efficient curriculum for the Gaussian relaxation training phase, reducing training time by 25% and memory by 33% compared to Duo while maintaining comparable perplexity on OpenWebText and LM1B and strong downstream performance. We release code, checkpoints, and a video-tutorial on: https://s-sahoo.com/duo-ch2
