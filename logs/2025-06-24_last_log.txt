Text:"5 2 0 2 3 2 ] . [ 2 1 4 7 5 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r OAgents: An Empirical Study of Building Effective AgentsRecently, Agentic AI has become an increasingly popular research field. However, we argue that current agent research practices lack standardization and scientific rigor, making it hard to conduct fair comparisons among methods. As result, it is still unclear how different design choices in agent frameworks affect effectiveness, and measuring their progress remains challenging. In this work, we conduct systematic empirical study on GAIA benchmark and BrowseComp to examine the impact of popular design choices in key agent components in fair and rigorous manner. We find that the lack of standard evaluation protocol makes previous works, even open-sourced ones, non-reproducible, with significant variance between random runs. Therefore, we introduce more robust evaluation protocol to stabilize comparisons. Our study reveals which components and designs are crucial for effective agents, while others are redundant, despite seeming logical. Based on our findings, we build and open-source OAgents, new foundation agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source projects. OAgents offers modular design for various agent components, promoting future research in Agentic AI. Date: June 24, 2025 Correspondence: Wangchunshu Zhou at zhouwangchunshu@oppo.com, Jiaheng Liu at liujiaheng@nju.edu.cn Code: https://github.com/OPPO-PersonalAI/OAgentsIn recent years, language agents [11, 19, 22, 29, 31, 3840] have received significant attention due to their potential in resolving general, complex tasks that traditionally required human intervention. However, despite the surge in the number of research works and open-sourced agent frameworks, current practices in Agentic AI research are far from being rigorous and scientific. Specifically, the current landscape of agent research suffers from lack of standardized designs and implementation details. Critical components such as planning [12, 21, 35], memory [20, 32, 36, 38], and tool use [17, 27] vary widely across different papers and frameworks, making it difficult to attribute performance improvements to specific innovations. Compounding this issue, reported results are often hard to reproduce due to inconsistent evaluation settings or undisclosed framework configurations [2, 9]. This fragmentation undermines the scientific rigor of the field, as findings cannot be reliably compared or built upon. Take the widely researched GAIA Benchmark [14] as an example. Despite the organizers provide public leaderboard with evaluation code and number of papers and projects being open-sourced, it is still very hard, if not impossible, for other researchers to reproduce their results because of number of inconspicuous factors are not standardized, including the implementation details of tools and prompts, as well as details 1 Figure 1 The key components of the OAgents framework, including planning, memory, tools, and test-time scaling. in the evaluation protocol such as how many runs are performed, how errors and failures are handled, and how different results are ensembles or aggregated. These factors often lead to large impact on the overall performance, sometimes the impact is even larger than some new architecture innovations in new research papers. However, they are generally not mentioned in the technical reports of different agent frameworks and are not even included in their open-sourced codebases. For example, some previous work conducted multiple runs and merged the results, but reported the results as pass@1. Moreover, the engineering design and details in different agent research papers and codebases are so large that it makes it impossible to conduct apples-to-apples comparisons on specific technical designs. This makes it very hard for the research community on agentic AI to properly conduct scientific research instead of digging into tricks on engineering details and evaluation protocols. As result, despite lot of agent research papers being released and the numbers on public benchmarks keeping increasing, the best practices on building effective agents are still very obscure. In this work, to promote truly scientific research on agentic AI and provide researchers with clear understanding of key factors in building effective agents, we conduct systematic empirical study on GAIA benchmark to sort out the core design choices in current agent research, analyze their impact on performance, and report practical tips for improving experimental stability and reproducibility. Specifically, we: (1) carefully implement and compare different designs on key agent components including planning, tool use, memory, test-time scaling strategies, etc., (2) systematically investigate the impacts of different LLM backbones and their combinations; (3) thoroughly analyze different practices for evaluation and provide more robust evaluation protocol. Based on the empirical study, we implement and release OAgents, language agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-sourced agent frameworks on GAIA benchmark and BrowseComp. More importantly, OAgents supports modularized integration of almost all critical designs and features in critical components of language agents, including: (1) different agentic planning mechanisms including static and dynamic workflow designs; (2) complete tool box including web search with different search sources, browsing tools and web crawlers, parsing tools compatible with more document types. (3) different design of the agentic memory module; (4) test-time scaling strategies for agents including different search algorithms and reflection/self-refine mechanisms. Hopefully, OAgents will facilitate scientific research on language agents by promoting apple-to-apple comparisons and standardizing evaluation protocols. In summary, our main contributions are as follows. 1. We present comprehensive agent framework - OAgents. OAgents encompass periodically revised plan generation, fine-grained task decomposition & simultaneous execution, optimization of multi-source web browsing, enhanced document parsing, and adaptive memory mechanisms that collectively enhance 2 performance across various tasks, ranking 1st among open-source agent frameworks on GAIA benchmark. 2. We conduct systematic empirical study and performance analyzes based on the OAgents framework, offering principles to decompose, analyze and opti"

Recently, Agentic AI has become an increasingly popular research field. However, we argue that current agent research practices lack standardization and scientific rigor, making it hard to conduct fair comparisons among methods. As a result, it is still unclear how different design choices in agent frameworks affect effectiveness, and measuring their progress remains challenging. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study on GAIA benchmark and BrowseComp to examine the impact of popular design choices in key agent components in a fair and rigorous manner. We find that the lack of a standard evaluation protocol makes previous works, even open-sourced ones, non-reproducible, with significant variance between random runs. Therefore, we introduce a more robust evaluation protocol to stabilize comparisons. Our study reveals which components and designs are crucial for effective agents, while others are redundant, despite seeming logical. Based on our findings, we build and open-source OAgents, a new foundation agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source projects. OAgents offers a modular design for various agent components, promoting future research in Agentic AI.
