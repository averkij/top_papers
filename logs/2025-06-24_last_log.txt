Text:"5 2 0 2 3 2 ] . [ 1 9 4 3 8 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r SlimMoE: Structured Compression of Large MoE Models via Zichong Li1, Chen Liang2, Zixuan Zhang1, Ilgee Hong1, Young Jin Kim2, Weizhu Chen2, Tuo Zhao1 1Georgia Tech 2Microsoft Abstract The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as powerful paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) while maintaining inference efficiency. However, their substantial memory requirements make them prohibitively expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resourceconstrained environments. To address this challenge, we propose SlimMoE, multi-stage compression framework that transforms large MoE models into significantly smaller and more efficient variants without the cost of training from scratch. Our method systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the performance degradation typical of one-shot pruning. Using SlimMoE, we compress Phi-3.5-MoE (41.9B total / 6.6B activated parameters) into two smaller models: Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total / 2.4B activated) and Phi-tiny-MoE (3.8B total / 1.1B activated), using only 400B tokens less than 10% of the original training data. These models can be fine-tuned on single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them well suited for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments show that the compressed models outperform others of similar size and remain competitive with larger models. For example, Phi-mini-MoE matches or exceeds the performance of Phi-3-mini while using only two-thirds of the activated parameters and achieves comparable MMLU scores to LLaMA 3.1 8B with significantly lower latency. These results highlight that structured pruning combined with multi-stage distillation is an effective strategy for building high-quality, compact MoE models, enabling broader adoption of MoE architectures across diverse computational environments. We release our models at https://huggi"

MICS, a novel reasoning-path searching scheme, enhances medical MLLMs like Chiron-o1 with robust generalizable reasoning and visual question-answering capabilities through comprehensive chain-of-thought data generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

SlimMoE compresses large MoE models into smaller, efficient variants using multi-stage compression without full retraining, maintaining competitive performance with significantly fewer resources.  					AI-generated summary 				 The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) while maintaining inference efficiency. However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression framework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient variants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our method systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the performance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this framework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to create Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE (3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of the original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned on a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them highly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments demonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and remain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves similar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated parameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having significantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning combined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating high-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE architectures. We make our models publicly available at https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-mini-MoE-instruct and https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-tiny-MoE-instruct .
