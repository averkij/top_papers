Text:"ReDit: Reward Dithering for Improved LLM Policy Optimization Chenxing Wei * 1 2 Jiarui Yu 3 Ying Tiffany He 1 Hande Dong 3 Yao Shu 4 Fei Yu 1 2 5 2 0 2 3 2 ] . [ 1 1 3 6 8 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r aDeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While its perfect reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks and different LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for similar duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these advantages. 1. Introduction Reinforcement learning (RL) is pivotal in Large Language Model (LLM) development(AI@Meta, 2025; Anthropic, *Work done during an internship at Tencent. 1College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, China 2Guangdong Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Economy (SZ), China 3Tencent, Shenzhen, China 4Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), China. Correspondence to: Yao Shu <yaoshu@hkust-gz.edu.cn>. Proceedings of the 2 nd Workshop on Models of Human Feedback for AI Alignment at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), Vancouver, Canada. PMLR 267, 2025. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 Initially, RL from human 2024; OpenAI et al., 2024). feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017; Ziegler et al., 2019) was employed to align pre-trained LLMs with human preferences (Lang et al., 2024; Ouyang et al., 2022). This typically involves training separate reward model (RM) on human preference data (Kaufmann et al., 2024), which then guides the LLM policy optimization (Lambert, 2025). While effective, this approach introduces considerable training overhead (Cao et al., 2024b). Subsequently, methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) were developed, enabling LLMs to learn directly from preference data and thus bypassing explicit RM training. However, these methods still require extensive collection of high-quality preference data. For reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding, DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (Shao et al., 2024)(GRPO) proposes an alternative: optimizing the LLM policy directly using rule-based reward system (Kong & Yang, 2022; Wang et al., 2025), thereby avoiding the need for external RMs or large preference datasets. For instance, such system might assign reward of 1 for outputs meeting predefined criteria (e.g., correctness, format compliance) and 0 otherwise (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). The simplicity and unbiased nature of these rule-based rewards prevent LLMs from hacking them, potentially fostering enhanced reasoning capabilities (Chan et al., 2023). However, such reward functions are often discrete, posing significant optimization challenges (Rengarajan et al., 2022; Vasan et al., 2024; Goyal et al., 2019). Consider an RL scenario with binary reward (Chatterji et al., 2021): policy model receives 1 for correct answer and 0 otherwise. During early training phases, policy LLM rarely generates completely correct answers, resulting in predominantly zero rewards across mini-batches (Cao et al., 2024a). Although the model may engage in exploratory behavior on difficult examples, the corresponding gradients remain minimal due to small advantage magnitudes (Chan et al., 2024). Thus, these hard examples and potentially beneficial explorations (Chan et al., 2024) are largely unexploited during the early stages. Conversely, the model may repeatedly reinforce easy examples (Xie et al., 2024), thus reducing incentives to explore alternative strategies for more difficult problems (Weaver & Tao, 2001). This phenomenon can lead to training stagnation in intermediate and advanced ReDit: Reward Dithering for Improved LLM Policy Optimization Figure 1. Training Dynamics of Gradient Norm and Reward for Qwen2.5-7B (Qwen et al., 2025) on GSM8K Dataset. Fig.s (a) and (b) compare gradient distributions and reward trends across training steps. The original GRPO method (Fig. (a)) suffers from significant gradient instabilityboth vanishing (red dots, norms 0.01) and exploding (purple asterisks, norms 5). In contrast, ReDit with Gaussian reward smoothing (Fig. (b)) effectively stabilizes optimization throughout training. stages. Consistent with this, as shown in Fig. 1(a), we observe that the policy model frequently suffers from gradient vanishing (Razin et al., 2024; Abdul Hameed et al., 2023) or explosion (Zhang et al., 2025) during these phases. This combination of insufficient exploration and gradient instability substantially impedes model convergence, representing critical obstacle to efficient RL in LLM. Figure 2. The figure illustrates how ReDit of different variances gradually smooth the reward distribution, showing the smoothing effect of perturbations of different variances. This observed phenomenon highlights that even perfectly accurate discrete reward functions face significant limitations within gradient-based optimization frameworks. Lending theoretical support to this, recent studies (Ivison et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Wen et al., 2025) have established that singular focus on increasing reward model accuracy does not necessarily translate to enhanced language model performance. In particular, Wen et al. (2025) theoretically substantiates the necessity for effective reward models to 2 integrate adequate variance and uncertainty to enable efficient optimization. The theoretical details are given in Sec. 3.2. Consequen"

Guardrailsexternal defense mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interactionshave emerged as promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is fragmented, lacking unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose novel, multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key dimensions, and introduce SecurityEfficiency-Utility evaluation framework to assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers structured foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. 1.

"Commutative Vector Quantization (CommVQ) reduces memory usage in long-context LLM inference by compressing the KV cache with additive quantization and integration of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE).  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring long context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory bottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative Vector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for long-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a lightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded via simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during decoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention mechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and low overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5% with 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with minimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context length on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

A novel memory mechanism called Surfel-Indexed View Memory enhances video generation by efficiently remembering and retrieving relevant past views, improving long-term scene coherence and reducing computational cost.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose a novel memory mechanism to build video generators that can explore environments interactively. Similar results have previously been achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control.

ReDit, a reward dithering method, addresses issues in discrete reward systems by introducing noise, leading to smoother optimization and faster convergence compared to standard methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect'' reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these advantages.

AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel, multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. The code is available at https://github.com/xunguangwang/SoK4JailbreakGuardrails.
