Text:"5 2 0 2 1 2 ] . [ 1 1 7 6 7 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r TPTT: Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans Fabien Furfaro 2025 Abstract Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable progress in natural language processing, but their computational and memory demands remain significant challenge, particularly for long-context inference. We introduce TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans), novel framework for enhancing pretrained Transformer models with efficient linearized attention mechanisms and advanced memory management. TPTT employs techniques such as Memory as Gate (MaG) and mixed linearized attention (LiZA). It is fully compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers library, enabling seamless adaptation of any causal LLM through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) without full retraining. We show the effectiveness of TPTT on the MMLU benchmark with models of approximately 1 billion parameters, observing substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. For instance, Titans-Llama-3.2-1B achieves 20% increase in Exact Match (EM) over its baseline. Statistical analyses and comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods confirm the practical scalability and robustness of TPTT.

[ 1 1 7 6 7 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r TPTT: Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans Fabien Furfaro 2025 Abstract Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable progress in natural language processing, but their computational and memory demands remain significant challenge, particularly for long-context inference. We introduce TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans), novel framework for enhancing pretrained Transformer models with efficient linearized attention mechanisms and advanced memory management. TPTT employs techniques such as Memory as Gate (MaG) and mixed linearized attention (LiZA). It is fully compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers library, enabling seamless adaptation of any causal LLM through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) without full retraining. We show the effectiveness of TPTT on the MMLU benchmark with models of approximately 1 billion parameters, observing substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. For instance, Titans-Llama-3.2-1B achieves 20% increase in Exact Match (EM) over its baseline. Statistical analyses and comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods confirm the practical scalability and robustness of TPTT. The source code is available at https://github.com/fabienfrfr/tptt and the Python package at https://pypi.org/project/tptt/. Figure 1: Overview of the TPTT architecture. On the left, the diagram illustrates decoder-only architecture where linear attention is injected in parallel of vanilla attention (LiZAttention). On the right, the detailed architecture of the linearized attention mechanism is depicted, highlighting the shared weights for query (Q), key (K), value (V), and output (O) projections. It also shows the management of the state memory (S) and the combination of outputs through the Memory as Gate (MaG) weighting mechanism. The diagram emphasizes the integration of linearized attention mechanisms and advanced memory management techniques, such as Delta Rule and AdaptativeAvgPool1D, contributing to processing and output generation.The success of transformer-based large language models (LLMs) [11, 16] has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), enabling unprecedented progress across wide range of tasks. However, the quadratic computational complexity and substantial memory requirements of the standard self-attention mechanism remain significant bottleneck, particularly for long-context inference. To address these challenges, recent research has explored several directions. Efficient attention mechanisms [9,18] have been proposed to reduce the complexity of self-attention from quadratic to linear or near-linear, fabien.furfaro@gmail.com 1 making it more tractable for long sequences. Recurrent architectures and internal memory mechanisms [2, 13] have also been developed to enhance the models ability to capture long-range dependencies, drawing inspiration from cognitive memory in biological systems rather than hardware memory. Additionally, parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches such as LoRA [8] allow for the adaptation of large pretrained models to new tasks without the need for full retraining.Despite these advances, most existing methods require significant architectural modifications or training from scratch, which limits their applicability to already pretrained models. For example, solutions like FlashAttention [3] and Mamba [6] focus on efficient architectures, while others such as LoLCat [19] and Liger [10] convert standard attention to linearized forms; notably, Liger exploits similar properties to those leveraged in this work, but does not rely on explicit linearization injection. In this work, we introduce TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans), framework that transforms pretrained transformer models into efficient and scalable architectures by incorporating linearized attention mechanisms and advanced internal memory augmentation. TPTT leverages techniques such as Memory as Gate (MaG) and mixed linearized attention (LiZA), drawing inspiration from the Titans architecture [2]. Our approach is fully compatible with existing frameworks and enables rapid adaptation of any causal LLM to long-context tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning with LoRA [8], without requiring full retraining. The goal is to unlock the potential of already trained models by equipping them with memory-augmented capabilities through lightweight adaptation.Standard self-attention in transformers computes pairwise interactions between all tokens, resulting in quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length [16]. To address this, linearized attention mechanisms approximate the softmax attention u"

A novel unsupervised post-training method improves dense image representations using pseudo-tasks and a pretrained diffusion model for in-context scene understanding.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce DIP, a novel unsupervised post-training method designed to enhance dense image representations in large-scale pretrained vision encoders for in-context scene understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex self-distillation architectures, our method trains the vision encoder using pseudo-tasks that explicitly simulate downstream in-context scenarios, inspired by meta-learning principles. To enable post-training on unlabeled data, we propose an automatic mechanism for generating in-context tasks that combines a pretrained diffusion model and the vision encoder itself. DIP is simple, unsupervised, and computationally efficient, requiring less than 9 hours on a single A100 GPU. By learning dense representations through pseudo in-context tasks, it achieves strong performance across a wide variety of downstream real-world in-context scene understanding tasks. It outperforms both the initial vision encoder and prior methods, offering a practical and effective solution for improving dense representations.

A novel dataset and verifiable reward mechanism enhance the explainability and efficiency of medical visual question answering models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Medical visual question answering aims to support clinical decision-making by enabling models to answer natural language questions based on medical images. While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to understand and trust model-generated answers. To address this, this work first proposes a Thinking with Visual Grounding (ThinkVG) dataset wherein the answer generation is decomposed into intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposal. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/BoKelvin/GEMeX-ThinkVG.

TPTT enhances large language models with efficient linearized attention and advanced memory management, improving both efficiency and accuracy for long-context inference.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable progress in natural language processing, but their computational and memory demands remain a significant challenge, particularly for long-context inference. We introduce TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans), a novel framework for enhancing pretrained Transformer models with efficient linearized attention mechanisms and advanced memory management. TPTT employs techniques such as Memory as Gate (MaG) and mixed linearized attention (LiZA). It is fully compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers library, enabling seamless adaptation of any causal LLM through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) without full retraining. We show the effectiveness of TPTT on the MMLU benchmark with models of approximately 1 billion parameters, observing substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. For instance, Titans-Llama-3.2-1B achieves a 20% increase in Exact Match (EM) over its baseline. Statistical analyses and comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods confirm the practical scalability and robustness of TPTT. Code is available at https://github.com/fabienfrfr/tptt .
