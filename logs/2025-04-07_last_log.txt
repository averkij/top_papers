INTRODUCTION Medical image segmentation plays pivotal role in numerous clinical applications, including anatomical structure analysis [1], disease diagnosis [2], surgery planning, and treatment monitoring [3]. By delineating the boundaries of organs, lesions, and other relevant anatomies, segmentation algorithms provide clinicians with crucial information for precise disease analysis. Over the past decade, deep learning-based methods have revolutionized this field, delivering unprecedented performance on various segmentation tasks and benchmarks. For example, DeepLab [4] [5] has achieved human-level performance in left ventricle segmentation from echocardiography for ejection fraction assessment [1], which has proven to save time for both sonographers and cardiologists via blinding and randomization clinical trial [6]. U-Net [7] has been employed for accurate cell detection and segmentation in light microscopy images [8] and 3D nnU-Net [9] has been widely used in various anatomy and lesion segmentation, such as heart chamber segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans [2], pancreas cancer and abdominal organ segmentation in Computed Tomograph (CT) scans [3] [10], and whole-body lesion segmentation in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans [11]. Driven by advanced network architectures [12] and large-scale datasets [13], recent trends in segmentation present paradigm shift from specialist models tailored for specific tasks to generalist or foundation models capable of performing segmentation without extensive task-specific model development [14][16]. One prominent example is the Segment Anything Model (SAM) [13], pioneer segmentation foundation model in computer vision that has shown remarkable generalization ability across wide range of two-dimensional (2D) natural image segmentation tasks. However, due to the substantial domain gap, its performance remains suboptimal in medical images [17] [18]. Despite these limitations, SAM can be effectively adapted to the medical domain through transfer learning. For instance, models such as MedSAM [19] and SAM-Med [20] [21] have demonstrated strong capabilities in segmenting various organs and abnormalities across diverse medical imaging modalities by fine-tuning SAM on large-scale medical datasets. 5 2 0 2 4 ] . e [ 1 0 0 6 3 0 . 4 0 5 2 : r Jun Ma is with AI Collaborative Centre, University Health Network; Vector Institute, Toronto, Canada ( Equal Contribution).

E-mail: bowang@vectorinstitute.ai 2 Despite the potential of these foundation models, their application to medical imaging is still limited and faces three main limitations. First, most medical image segmentation foundation models [19] [20] are primarily designed for 2D image data and may not capture the three-dimensional (3D) spatial relationships or temporal information in volumetric and video medical data. Second, although some studies have extended SAM to 3D image segmentation using 3D image encoders [21] and adapters [22][24] or developed interactive 3D segmentation models [25][27] to incorporate manual corrections, there is still lack of general models to segment both 3D images and videos, which are frequently necessary in real-world clinical workflows. The state-of-the-art video segmentation model, SAM2 [28], has shown great potential to fill this gap [29][32], but adaption on large-scale datasets has been underexplored. Finally, large-scale validation of these models in practical image-labeling scenarios remains notably absent, leaving important questions about their scalability and utility in facilitating high-throughput medical image annotation tasks. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting MedSAM2, gen"

Medical image and video segmentation is a critical task for precision medicine, which has witnessed considerable progress in developing task or modality-specific and generalist models for 2D images. However, there have been limited studies on building general-purpose models for 3D images and videos with comprehensive user studies. Here, we present MedSAM2, a promptable segmentation foundation model for 3D image and video segmentation. The model is developed by fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model 2 on a large medical dataset with over 455,000 3D image-mask pairs and 76,000 frames, outperforming previous models across a wide range of organs, lesions, and imaging modalities. Furthermore, we implement a human-in-the-loop pipeline to facilitate the creation of large-scale datasets resulting in, to the best of our knowledge, the most extensive user study to date, involving the annotation of 5,000 CT lesions, 3,984 liver MRI lesions, and 251,550 echocardiogram video frames, demonstrating that MedSAM2 can reduce manual costs by more than 85%. MedSAM2 is also integrated into widely used platforms with user-friendly interfaces for local and cloud deployment, making it a practical tool for supporting efficient, scalable, and high-quality segmentation in both research and healthcare environments.
