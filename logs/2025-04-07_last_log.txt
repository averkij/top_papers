Text:"SHIELDAGENT: Shielding Agents via Verifiable Safety Policy Reasoning Zhaorun Chen 1 Mintong Kang 2 Bo Li1. Introduction 5 2 0 2 6 2 ] . [ 1 8 3 7 2 2 . 3 0 5 2 : r Autonomous agents powered by foundation models have seen widespread adoption across various real-world applications. However, they remain highly vulnerable to malicious instructions and attacks, which can result in severe consequences such as privacy breaches and financial losses. More critically, existing guardrails for LLMs are not applicable due to the complex and dynamic nature of agents. To tackle these challenges, we propose SHIELDAGENT, the first guardrail agent designed to enforce explicit safety policy compliance for the action trajectory of other protected agents through logical reasoning. Specifically, SHIELDAGENT first constructs safety policy model by extracting verifiable rules from policy documents and structuring them into set of action-based probabilistic rule circuits. Given the action trajectory of the protected agent, SHIELDAGENT retrieves relevant rule circuits and generates shielding plan, leveraging its comprehensive tool library and executable code for formal verification. In addition, given the lack of guardrail benchmarks for agents, we introduce SHIELDAGENT-BENCH, dataset with 3K safety-related pairs of agent instructions and action trajectories, collected via SOTA attacks across 6 web environments and 7 risk categories. Experiments show that SHIELDAGENT achieves SOTA on SHIELDAGENT-BENCH and three existing benchmarks, outperforming prior methods by 11.3% on average with high recall of 90.1%. Additionally, SHIELDAGENT reduces API queries by 64.7% and inference time by 58.2%, demonstrating its high precision and efficiency in safeguarding agents. 1University of Chicago, Chicago IL, USA 2University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign IL, USA. Correspondence to: Zhaorun Chen, Bo Li <{zhaorun, bol}@uchicago.edu>. Our project is available and continuously maintained here: https: //shieldagent-aiguard.github.io/ 1 LLM-based autonomous agents are rapidly gathering momentum across various applications, integrating their ability to call external tools and make autonomous decisions in real-world tasks such as web browsing (Zhou et al., 2023), GUI navigation (Lin et al., 2024), and embodied control (Mao et al., 2023). Among these, LLM-based web agents, such as OpenAIs Operator (OpenAI, 2025b), deep research agent (OpenAI, 2025a), and Anthropics computer assistant agent (Anthropic, 2024), have become particularly prominent, driving automation in areas like online shopping, stock trading, and information retrieval. Despite their growing capabilities, users remain reluctant to trust current web agents with high-stakes data and assets, as they are still highly vulnerable to malicious instructions and adversarial attacks (Chen et al., 2024c; Wu et al., 2025), which can lead to severe consequences such as privacy breaches and financial losses (Levy et al., 2024). Existing guardrails primarily focus on LLMs as models, while failing to safeguard them as agentic systems due to two key challenges: (1) LLM-based agents operate through sequential interactions with dynamic environments, making it difficult to capture unsafe behaviors that emerge over time (Xiang et al., 2024); (2) Safety policies governing these agents are often complex and encoded in lengthy regulation documents (e.g. EU AI Act (Act, 2024)) or corporate policy handbooks (GitLab, 2025), making it difficult to systematically extract, verify, and enforce rules across different platforms (Zeng et al., 2024). As result, safeguarding the safety of LLM-based web agents remains an open challenge. To address these challenges, we introduce SHIELDAGENT, the first LLM-based guardrail agent designed to shield the action trajectories of other LLM-based autonomous agents, ensuring explicit safety compliance through probabilistic logic reasoning and verification. Unlike existing approaches that rely on simple text-based filtering (Xiang et al., 2024), SHIELDAGENT accounts for the uniqueness of agent actions and explicitly verifies them against relevant policies in an efficient manner. At its core, SHIELDAGENT automatically constructs robust safety policy model by extracting verifiable rules from policy documents, iteratively refining them, and grouping them based on different action types to form set of structured, action-based probabilistic rule SHIELDAGENT: Shielding Agents via Verifiable Safety Policy Reasoning circuits (Kang & Li, 2024). During inference, SHIELDAGENT only verifies the relevant rule circuits corresponding to the invoked action, ensuring both precision and efficiency. Specifically, SHIELDAGENT references from hybrid memory module of both long-term shielding workflows and shortterm interaction history, generates shielding plan with specialized operations from rich tool library, and runs formal verification code. Once rule is verified, SHIELDAGENT performs probabilistic inference within the circuits and provides binary safety label, identifies any violated rules, and generates detailed explanations to justify its decision. While evaluating these guardrails is critical for ensuring agent safety, existing benchmarks remain small in scale, cover limited risk categories, and lack explicit risk definitions (see Table 1). Therefore, we introduce SHIELDAGENTBENCH, the first comprehensive agent guardrail benchmark comprising 2K safety-related pairs of agent instructions and trajectories across six web environments and seven risk categories. Specifically, each unsafe agent trajectory is generated under two types of attacks (Chen et al., 2024c; Xu et al., 2024) based on different perturbation sources (i.e., agentbased and environment-based), capturing risks present both within the agent system and the external environments. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that SHIELDAGENT achieves SOTA performance on both SHIELDAGENT-BENCH and three existing benchmarks (i.e., ST-WebAgentBench (Levy et al., 2024), VWA-Adv (Wu et al., 2025), and AgentHarm (Andriushchenko et al.)). Specifically, SHIELDAGENT outperforms the previous best guardrail method by 11.3% on SHIELDAGENT-BENCH, and 7.4% on average across existing benchmarks. Grounded on robust safety policy reasoning, it achieves the lowest false positive rate at 4.8% and high recall rate of violated rules at 90.1%. Additionally, SHIELDAGENT reduces the number of closed-source API queries by 64.7%"

Autonomous agents powered by foundation models have seen widespread adoption across various real-world applications. However, they remain highly vulnerable to malicious instructions and attacks, which can result in severe consequences such as privacy breaches and financial losses. More critically, existing guardrails for LLMs are not applicable due to the complex and dynamic nature of agents. To tackle these challenges, we propose ShieldAgent, the first guardrail agent designed to enforce explicit safety policy compliance for the action trajectory of other protected agents through logical reasoning. Specifically, ShieldAgent first constructs a safety policy model by extracting verifiable rules from policy documents and structuring them into a set of action-based probabilistic rule circuits. Given the action trajectory of the protected agent, ShieldAgent retrieves relevant rule circuits and generates a shielding plan, leveraging its comprehensive tool library and executable code for formal verification. In addition, given the lack of guardrail benchmarks for agents, we introduce ShieldAgent-Bench, a dataset with 3K safety-related pairs of agent instructions and action trajectories, collected via SOTA attacks across 6 web environments and 7 risk categories. Experiments show that ShieldAgent achieves SOTA on ShieldAgent-Bench and three existing benchmarks, outperforming prior methods by 11.3% on average with a high recall of 90.1%. Additionally, ShieldAgent reduces API queries by 64.7% and inference time by 58.2%, demonstrating its high precision and efficiency in safeguarding agents.
