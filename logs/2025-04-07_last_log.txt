Text:"Multi-SWE-bench: Multilingual Benchmark for Issue ResolvingThe task of issue resolving is to modify codebase to generate patch that addresses given issue. However, existing benchmarks, such as SWE-bench, focus almost exclusively on Python, making them insufficient for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse software ecosystems. To address this, we introduce multilingual issue-resolving benchmark, called Multi-SWE-bench, covering Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Rust, C, and C++. It includes total of 1, 632 high-quality instances, which were carefully annotated from 2, 456 candidates by 68 expert annotators, ensuring that the benchmark can provide an accurate and reliable evaluation. Based on Multi-SWE-bench, we evaluate series of state-of-the-art models using three representative methods (Agentless, SWE-agent, and OpenHands) and present comprehensive analysis with key empirical insights. In addition, we launch Multi-SWE-RL open-source community, aimed at building large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training datasets for issue-resolving tasks. As an initial contribution, we release set of 4, 723 well-structured instances spanning seven programming languages, laying solid foundation for RL research in this domain. More importantly, we open-source our entire data production pipeline, along with detailed tutorials, encouraging the open-source community to continuously contribute and expand the dataset. We envision our Multi-SWE-bench and the ever-growing Multi-SWE-RL community as catalysts for advancing RL toward its full potential, bringing us one step closer to the dawn of AGI. 5 2 0 2 3 ] .

However, existing research lacks unified evaluation standard, often relying on isolated benchmarks to assess these capabilities. Moreover, current work highlights the potential of mixed-modality generation capabilities through case studiessuch as generating auxiliary lines in images to solve geometric problems, or reasoning through problem before generating corresponding image. Despite this, there is no standardized benchmark to assess models on such unified tasks. To address this gap, we introduce MME-Unify, also termed as MME-U, the first benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal comprehension, generation, and mixed-modality generation capabilities. For comprehension and generation tasks, we curate diverse set of tasks from 12 datasets, aligning their formats and metrics to develop standardized evaluation framework. For unified tasks, we design five subtasks to rigorously assess how models understanding and generation capabilities can mutually enhance each other. Evaluation of 12 U-MLLMs, including Janus-Pro, EMU3, and Gemini2-Flash, reveals significant room for improvement, particularly in areas such as instruction following and image generation quality. 1. Introduction Unlike traditional MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4V) and purely generative models (e.g., DALL-E 3), U-MLLMs [3, 25, 33, 37] excel in processing mixed-modal inputs and outputs, providing enhanced flexibility and the ability to address broader spectrum of complex tasks. Recently, closedsource U-MLLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, ha"

We introduce five novel tasks testing multimodal reasoning, including image editing, commonsense QA with image generation, and geometric reasoning. 3. Comprehensive Model Benchmarking.

"Existing MLLM benchmarks face significant challenges in evaluating Unified MLLMs (U-MLLMs) due to: 1) lack of standardized benchmarks for traditional tasks, leading to inconsistent comparisons; 2) absence of benchmarks for mixed-modality generation, which fails to assess multimodal reasoning capabilities. We present a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to systematically assess U-MLLMs. Our benchmark includes: Standardized Traditional Task Evaluation. We sample from 12 datasets, covering 10 tasks with 30 subtasks, ensuring consistent and fair comparisons across studies." 2. Unified Task Assessment. We introduce five novel tasks testing multimodal reasoning, including image editing, commonsense QA with image generation, and geometric reasoning. 3. Comprehensive Model Benchmarking. We evaluate 12 leading U-MLLMs, such as Janus-Pro, EMU3, VILA-U, and Gemini2-flash, alongside specialized understanding (e.g., Claude-3.5-Sonnet) and generation models (e.g., DALL-E-3). Our findings reveal substantial performance gaps in existing U-MLLMs, highlighting the need for more robust models capable of handling mixed-modality tasks effectively. The code and evaluation data can be found in https://mme-unify.github.io/."

In this work, we present VARGPT-v1.1, an advanced unified visual autoregressive model that builds upon our previous framework VARGPT. The model preserves the dual paradigm of next-token prediction for visual understanding and next-scale generation for image synthesis. Specifically, VARGPT-v1.1 integrates: (1) a novel training strategy combining iterative visual instruction tuning with reinforcement learning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), (2) an expanded training corpus containing 8.3M visual-generative instruction pairs, (3) an upgraded language model backbone using Qwen2, (4) enhanced image generation resolution, and (5) emergent image editing capabilities without architectural modifications. These advancements enable VARGPT-v1.1 to achieve state-of-the-art performance in multimodal understanding and text-to-image instruction-following tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in both comprehension and generation metrics. Notably, through visual instruction tuning, the model acquires image editing functionality while maintaining architectural consistency with its predecessor, revealing the potential for unified visual understanding, generation, and editing. Our findings suggest that well-designed unified visual autoregressive models can effectively adopt flexible training strategies from large language models (LLMs), exhibiting promising scalability. The codebase and model weights are publicly available at https://github.com/VARGPT-family/VARGPT-v1.1.
