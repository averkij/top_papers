Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved considerable performance across various agentic planning tasks. However, traditional agent planning approaches adopt a "flood irrigation" methodology that indiscriminately injects gold trajectories, external feedback, and domain knowledge into agent models. This practice overlooks the fundamental human cognitive principle of situational self-awareness during decision-making-the ability to dynamically assess situational demands and strategically employ resources during decision-making. We propose agentic knowledgeable self-awareness to address this gap, a novel paradigm enabling LLM-based agents to autonomously regulate knowledge utilization. Specifically, we propose KnowSelf, a data-centric approach that applies agents with knowledgeable self-awareness like humans. Concretely, we devise a heuristic situation judgement criterion to mark special tokens on the agent's self-explored trajectories for collecting training data. Through a two-stage training process, the agent model can switch between different situations by generating specific special tokens, achieving optimal planning effects with minimal costs. Our experiments demonstrate that KnowSelf can outperform various strong baselines on different tasks and models with minimal use of external knowledge.

In the interaction between agents and their environments, agents expand their capabilities by planning and executing actions. However, LLM-based agents face substantial challenges when deployed in novel environments or required to navigate unconventional action spaces. To empower agents to autonomously explore environments, optimize workflows, and enhance their understanding of actions, we propose SynWorld, a framework that allows agents to synthesize possible scenarios with multi-step action invocation within the action space and perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration to effectively refine their action knowledge in the current environment. Our experiments demonstrate that SynWorld is an effective and general approach to learning action knowledge in new environments. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/SynWorld.

This paper introduces Comprehensive Relighting, the first all-in-one approach that can both control and harmonize the lighting from an image or video of humans with arbitrary body parts from any scene. Building such a generalizable model is extremely challenging due to the lack of dataset, restricting existing image-based relighting models to a specific scenario (e.g., face or static human). To address this challenge, we repurpose a pre-trained diffusion model as a general image prior and jointly model the human relighting and background harmonization in the coarse-to-fine framework. To further enhance the temporal coherence of the relighting, we introduce an unsupervised temporal lighting model that learns the lighting cycle consistency from many real-world videos without any ground truth. In inference time, our temporal lighting module is combined with the diffusion models through the spatio-temporal feature blending algorithms without extra training; and we apply a new guided refinement as a post-processing to preserve the high-frequency details from the input image. In the experiments, Comprehensive Relighting shows a strong generalizability and lighting temporal coherence, outperforming existing image-based human relighting and harmonization methods.
