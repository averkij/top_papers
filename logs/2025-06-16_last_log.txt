CRAFT, a multi-agent system using policy-aware persuasive strategies, challenges policy-adherent LLM-based agents in customer service to assess and improve their robustness against adversarial attacks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies, appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger, research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial attacks

pLSTMs are parallelizable linear RNNs designed for DAGs, demonstrating superior performance on long-range tasks and benchmarks compared to Transformers.  					AI-generated summary 				 Modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have recently challenged the Transformer in language modeling. However, their structure constrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing multi-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a pre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are well suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of multi-dimensionality to linear RNNs. We introduce parallelizable Linear Source Transition Mark networks (pLSTMs) using Source, Transition, and Mark gates that act on the line graph of a general DAG. This enables parallelization in analogy to parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential linear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this scheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations, and padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding activation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes: a directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode (D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce arrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains long-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize well to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate. On established molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks, pLSTMs also show strong performance. Code and Datasets are available at: https://github.com/ml-jku/plstm_experiments.

A new dataset named CapRetrieval is introduced to evaluate the ability of text encoders to recognize fine-grained entities and events, highlighting challenges in dense retrieval tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 This work focuses on an observed limitation of text encoders: embeddings may not be able to recognize fine-grained entities or events within the semantics, resulting in failed dense retrieval on even simple cases. To examine such behaviors, we first introduce a new evaluation dataset in Chinese, named CapRetrieval, whose passages are image captions, and queries are phrases inquiring entities or events in various forms. Zero-shot evaluation suggests that encoders may fail on these fine-grained matching, regardless of training sources or model sizes. Aiming for enhancement, we proceed to finetune encoders with our proposed data generation strategies, which obtains the best performance on CapRetrieval. Within this process, we further identify an issue of granularity dilemma, a challenge for embeddings to express fine-grained salience while aligning with overall semantics. Our dataset, code and models in this work are publicly released at https://github.com/lxucs/CapRetrieval.
