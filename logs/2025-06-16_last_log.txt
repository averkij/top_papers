[ 1 2 9 8 0 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r aUniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging key insight: Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints on the project page: https://s-sahoo.com/duo 1. Introduction An eternal theme in mathematics is that discreteness emerges from underlying continuity. From quantum mechanics, where the quantized energy states of electrons arise as solutions to continuous wave equations, to the Fourier decomposition of the Heaviside function, which results in trigonometric series, and to the binary logic of digital circuits, fundamentally driven by smooth analog currents, 1Computer and Information Science, Cornell Tech, NYC, USA. 2School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland.

Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 Figure 1: An illustration of Uniform-state discrete diffusion (top) and the underlying Gaussian diffusion (bottom). While both are separate Markov processes, applying arg max maps Gaussian latents wt Rn to discrete latents zt V, transforming their marginals from qt(.x; αt) (6) to qt(.x; (αt)) (1) and adjusting diffusion parameters from αt to αt = (αt) (10). Notably, the ELBO for Uniformstate diffusion induces tighter bound on the likelihood than Gaussian diffusion, as established in Theorem 3.1. discreteness has repeatedly and naturally emerged from an underlying continuum. Our work continues this tradition by demonstrating that discrete diffusion process is, in fact, an emergent phenomenon of an underlying continuous Gaussian diffusion process. This perspective enables the design of faster training and sampling algorithms for discrete diffusion models. Diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015) are powerful generative models inspired by physics. Gaussian diffusion models excel at synthesizing realistic and high-quality continuous-valued data such as images (Ho et al., 2020; Rombach et al., 2022), audio (Kong et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023b), and videos (Ho et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023; Esser et al., 2023; Blattmann et al., 2023). Gaussian diffusion is well studiedthe success of these models is rooted in techniques such as efficient parameterizations of the denoising model, which improve upon the standard meanparameterization (Ho et al., 2020; Salimans & Ho, 2022; Zheng et al., 2023), faster training techniques (Kingma et al., 2021), efficient samplers (Karras et al., 2022), and distillaThe Diffusion Duality tion schemes that enable single-step generation (Song et al., 2023; Song & Dhariwal, 2023; Yin et al., 2024). While Gaussian diffusion is well-studied, it underperforms discrete diffusion models on tasks involving discrete data such as text (Sahoo et al., 2024b), graphs (Liu et al., 2023a), and molecules (Lee et al., 2025). However, from the perspective of Gaussian diffusion, the design space for discrete diffusion models remains primitive: mean parameterization for the denoising model (Sahoo et al., 2024a; Schiff et al., 2025) and slow ancestral sampling (Austin et al., 2021) are still the dominant approaches. Recent work on distilling Masked Discrete Diffusion Models (MDMs) improves sampling speed (Deschenaux & Gulcehre, 2024), but performance degrades severely in the few-step regime. Unlike Gaussian diffusion models with Probability Flow ODEs (Song et al., 2020), MDMs lack an implicit property: deterministic mapping from noise to data. This property is vital for few-step distillation methods (Song et al., 2023; Frans et al., 2024), but MDMs forgo it due to their deterministic prior, which requires stochasticity during sampling. Our objective is (1) to design framework for discrete diffusion that enables the transfer of advanced training and inference techniques from Gaussian diffusion to discrete diffusion models. And (2) create language models that support few-step generation. To this end, we focus on Uniform-state Diffusion Models (USDMs) (Austin et al., 2021). In this paper, we discover very remarkable property of USDMsthese emerge from Gaussian diffusion processes as illustrated in Fig. 1. We call this phenomenon the Diffusion Duality which expands the design space of USDMs, making it possible to incorporate techniques developed for Gaussian diffusion. Notably, USDMs models allow token updates during reverse sampling unlike MDMs, naturally correcting earlier mistakes without requiring costly predictor-corrector (Zhao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025) stepssaving function evaluations (NFEs). However, these models have historically underperformed compared to MDMs (Austin et al., 2021; Lou et al., 2023), raising the key question: Can USDMs be made competitive with MDMs? And more importantly, can the implicit property of the underlying Gaussian diffusion be leveraged for fast, few-step generation? We answer both questions with Duo, rich framework of theoretical connections between USDMs and Gaussian diffusion. Duo enriches the design space of USDMs by incorporating Gaussian diffusion, which allows us to develop efficient training strategies that accelerate the training of USDMs, significantly reducing the performance gap between MDMs and AR models on standard language generation benchmarks. Notably, we surpass AR models on 3 out of 7 zero-shot datasets  (Table 2)  . Furthermore, this duality allows us to adapt "

Drawing on knowledge from group of medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim, examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, benchmark composed of problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the likelihood of data contamination. team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating "

Text:"Configurable Preference Tuning with Rubric-Guided Synthetic Data Vıctor Gallego 1 5 2 0 2 3 1 ] . [ 1 2 0 7 1 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r aModels of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in singular, static set of preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically adjust their behavior based on explicit, humaninterpretable directives. CPT leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system prompts derived from structured, finegrained rubrics that define desired attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubricguided preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only offers fine-grained control but also provides mechanism for modeling more nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts, such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at github.com/vicgalle/configurablepreference-tuning 1. Introduction The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up wide array of applications. However, aligning these models with desired human preferences, behaviors, and safety protocols remains significant challenge. Techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ziegler et al., 2019; Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2024) have shown success in steering LLMs towards preferred responses. However, critical, often implicit, assumption underpins many existing human feedback models: the notion of singular, static, 1Komorebi AI Technologies, Madrid, Spain. Correspondence to: Vıctor Gallego <victor.gallego@komorebi.ai>. Published at the ICML 2025 Workshop on Models of Human Feedback for AI Alignment. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 and monolithic set of preferences. Human preferences are rarely monolithic; they are dynamic, context-dependent, and multifaceted, influenced by factors ranging from individual user needs and cultural norms to evolving ethical considerations and task-specific requirements. Current models, by baking in an averaged or aggregated preference profile during fine-tuning, often lack the adaptability to reflect this richness. This inflexibility means that altering an LLMs behaviorfor instance, to adjust its writing style, modify its safety strictures for different environments, or cater to diverse user cohortstypically necessitates resource-intensive retraining or further fine-tuning. Such limitations hinder the development of truly robust, interpretable, and adaptable AI systems capable of genuinely understanding and responding to the spectrum of human intentions. This paper directly addresses this limitation by challenging the assumption of monolithic preferences. We introduce Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), novel framework that endows LLMs with the ability to dynamically adjust their behavior at inference time based on explicit, humaninterpretable directives. CPT leverages synthetically generated preference data conditioned on system prompts that are derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics. These rubrics may define desired attributessuch as stylistic nuances, safety levels, or persona adherencealong various dimensions. By fine-tuning an LLM with these rubric-guided preference pairs using DPO-style objective, the model learns to modulate its outputs in response to the corresponding system prompt, without requiring retraining for each new configuration. Our contribution offers pathway towards more granular, transparent, and controllable alignment. It moves beyond single one-size-fits-all preference model, allowing for the explicit specification and operationalization of diverse behavioral configurations. We demonstrate that CPT enables fine-grained control contributing to the development of more robustly aligned AI systems that can better reflect the multifaceted nature of human feedback. 1.1. Related Work The challenge of moving beyond single, averaged preference model in LLMs has spurred growing interest in personalized Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback Configurable Preference Tuning with Rubric-Guided Synthetic Data (RLHF). Broadly, approaches to specialize LLM behavior can be seen through different lenses. Some methods aim to derive single policy that represents compromise or aggregation of diverse user preferences (Dumoulin et al., 2023; Conitzer et al., 2024). While these improve upon simple average, they may not fully cater to specific, nuanced individual needs. Closer to our work are approaches designed for downstream specialization of policy or its underlying reward model to particular user, persona, or specified context. Some methods learn direct mapping from user-specific information (e.g., interaction history, user IDs, or textual descriptions) to tailored reward signals or policy adjustments. For instance, (Poddar et al., 2024) use variational preference learning to encode user rankings into latent variable conditioning the reward model. (Li et al., 2024) compute user embeddings to condition base LLM via soft prompting in their P-RLHF framework. These methods often rely on inferring latent representations of user preferences, which, while powerful, may lack the direct interpretability and explicit controllability offered by rubric-based specifications. (Gallego, 2024) enhances DPO for language models by allowing flexible safety configurations via system prompts without hard-coding behaviors, but doesnt account for non-binary preference levels. Another line of research, exemplified by the work of (Barreto et al., 2025) on Reward Feature Models (RFMs) and related approaches (Chen et al., 2024; Go et al., 2023), focuses on learning set of underlying reward features from context-response pairs. User-specific preferences are then modeled by learning set of weights for these features, often through adaptation with few examples from the target user. The work of (Barreto et al., 2025) demonstrate that an RFM can be trained on pairwise comparisons, resulting in reward features that are linearly combined with userspecific weights wh to represent p(y yx, h), enabling fast adaptation to new users by learning these weights.

Unlike prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry, we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for comprehensive 3D completion.

Duo improves uniform-state discrete diffusion models by transferring techniques from Gaussian diffusion, enhancing training speed and enabling fast few-step text generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight: Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints on the project page: http://s-sahoo.github.io/duo

LLMs perform well on implementation-heavy competitive programming problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning, as highlighted by LiveCodeBench Pro.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim, examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in code-centric LLM reasoning.

SkillBlender is a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that uses pretrained primitive skills to efficiently solve diverse loco-manipulation tasks for humanoid robots.  					AI-generated summary 				 Humanoid robots hold significant potential in accomplishing daily tasks across diverse environments thanks to their flexibility and human-like morphology. Recent works have made significant progress in humanoid whole-body control and loco-manipulation leveraging optimal control or reinforcement learning. However, these methods require tedious task-specific tuning for each task to achieve satisfactory behaviors, limiting their versatility and scalability to diverse tasks in daily scenarios. To that end, we introduce SkillBlender, a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for versatile humanoid loco-manipulation. SkillBlender first pretrains goal-conditioned task-agnostic primitive skills, and then dynamically blends these skills to accomplish complex loco-manipulation tasks with minimal task-specific reward engineering. We also introduce SkillBench, a parallel, cross-embodiment, and diverse simulated benchmark containing three embodiments, four primitive skills, and eight challenging loco-manipulation tasks, accompanied by a set of scientific evaluation metrics balancing accuracy and feasibility. Extensive simulated experiments show that our method significantly outperforms all baselines, while naturally regularizing behaviors to avoid reward hacking, resulting in more accurate and feasible movements for diverse loco-manipulation tasks in our daily scenarios. Our code and benchmark will be open-sourced to the community to facilitate future research. Project page: https://usc-gvl.github.io/SkillBlender-web/.

Configurable Preference Tuning enables language models to dynamically adjust their behavior based on human-interprettable directives, using rubric-guided preference data for fine-tuning and inference-time modulation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more nuanced and context-dependent human feedback.

InterSyn, a large-scale dataset with tightly interleaved image-text outputs and automated quality refinement, improves multimodal understanding and generation through the SEIR method and SynJudge, an automatic evaluation tool.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly improved multimodal understanding and generation. However, these models still struggle to generate tightly interleaved image-text outputs, primarily due to the limited scale, quality and instructional richness of current training datasets. To address this, we introduce InterSyn, a large-scale multimodal dataset constructed using our Self-Evaluation with Iterative Refinement (SEIR) method. InterSyn features multi-turn, instruction-driven dialogues with tightly interleaved imagetext responses, providing rich object diversity and rigorous automated quality refinement, making it well-suited for training next-generation instruction-following LMMs. Furthermore, to address the lack of reliable evaluation tools capable of assessing interleaved multimodal outputs, we introduce SynJudge, an automatic evaluation model designed to quantitatively assess multimodal outputs along four dimensions: text content, image content, image quality, and image-text synergy.   Experimental studies show that the SEIR method leads to substantially higher dataset quality compared to an otherwise identical process without refinement.   Moreover, LMMs trained on InterSyn achieve uniform performance gains across all evaluation metrics, confirming InterSyn's utility for advancing multimodal systems.
