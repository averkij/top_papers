Text:"5 2 0 2 3 1 ] . [ 1 0 3 9 1 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r FEEDBACK FRICTION: LLMs Struggle to Fully Incorporate External Feedback Dongwei Jiang Alvin Zhang Andrew Wang Nicholas Andrews Daniel Khashabi djiang21@jhu.edu Equal contribution bzhang90@jh.edu Corresponding authorsRecent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs ability to incorporate feedback by designing controlled experimental environment. For each problem, solver model attempts solution, then feedback generator with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback, after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across diverse range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly, even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show resistance to feedback, limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To mitigate this limitation, we experiment with samplingbased strategies like progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help models achieve target performance. We also perform rigorous exploration of potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in self-improvement. Figure 1: Top: Accuracy of various solver models when iteratively exposed to feedback of feedback model (GPT-4.1 mini) with access to ground-truth answers. The horizontal dotted line represents the target accuracy models could theoretically attain if they successfully incorporated all feedback (details in 4.1). Despite receiving high-quality feedback, solver models consistently plateau below their target accuracy. Bottom: Breakdown of questions that remained unsolved by the strongest solver model tested (Claude 3.7 Thinking) after multiple correction attempts. Feedback resistance, rather than feedback quality issues, is responsible for the majority of persistent errors. Preprint. Under review.The prospect of self-improving Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked both excitement and debate. Questions persist about LLMs inherent ability to self-improve without external guidance [1, 2], yet several studies have shown that LLMs can boost their performance when provided with accurate external feedback during test time without any parameter updates or training [35]. However, while prior studies establish the existence of performance gains from external feedback, the upper bounds of such improvement remains largely unexplored. This improvement capability would have far-reaching implications for applications such as scientific discovery [68] and complex planning [9, 10], where repeated refinement cycles with feedback are critical for success. This raises critical question: can models fully incorporate correct feedback to self-improve and reach their maximum potential? Answering this question is not straightforward, as self-improvement performance depends on two connected factors: feedback quality and the ability to incorporate feedback. To decouple these two factors, we create controlled experimental environment that provides near-optimal conditions for feedback incorporationone where models receive high-quality, targeted guidance based on complete ground-truth information. Figure 2 demonstrates our setup. The solver model attempts to solve problems iteratively, receives feedback from strong feedback model on each incorrect answer, and retries again for up to 10 consecutive iterations. The feedback generator has access to the complete history of all previous attempts and responses, enabling targeted guidance that addresses persistent errors. While this controlled environment with high-quality feedback provides an ideal testing ground, the effectiveness of feedback incorporation may depend significantly on the quality of the feedback. To assess them, we implement three increasingly sophisticated feedback mechanisms to determine how much feedback quality impacts model performance and whether any level of feedback enables models to reach target accuracy. Binary Correctness Feedback (F1) provides simple indication of correctness (e.g., the answer is wrong). Self-Generated Reflective Feedback (F2) has the model itself analyze potential errors using correct answers and available solution steps (e.g., you correctly set up the equation but made an error when computing the derivative...). Finally, Strong-Model Reflective Feedback (F3) uses more capable external model (GPT-4.1 mini) to generate feedback. Details of our evaluation framework and feedback generation process can be found in 2. We conduct systematic study using all three forms of feedback across strong frontier models including Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct, Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128EInstruct-FP8, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking. We evaluate these models across diverse tasks, including AIME 2024, MATH-500, TriviaQA, PopQA, MMLU, MMLU Pro, GPQA, and two synthetic digit multiplication tasks. While higher-quality feedback does improve self-improvement performance, fundamental limitation persists. As shown in Figure 1, even with our best feedback mechanismStrong-Model Reflective Feedback (F3)models consistently fall short of the target accuracy (i.e., the accuracy of an ideal model if it successfully incorporated all the given feedback). We name this weakness FEEDBACK FRICTION (3.2). Our analysis in 4 reveals several key insights into FEEDBACK FRICTION. First, we categorize errors that persist after multiple feedback iterations and find that feedback resistance (i.e., models failing to incorporate clear and accurate feedback) is the dominant failure mode across all tasks (4.1). Second, we attempt to mitigate it by avoiding repeated wrong answers through sampling strategies. While performan"

Med-PRM enhances clinical decision making by verifying reasoning steps against medical knowledge bases, achieving state-of-the-art performance in medical QA benchmarks with improved accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models have shown promise in clinical decision making, but current approaches struggle to localize and correct errors at specific steps of the reasoning process. This limitation is critical in medicine, where identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50% using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using small-scale models of 8 billion parameters. Our code and data are available at: https://med-prm.github.io/

LLMs show resistance to feedback, termed feedback friction, even under ideal conditions, and sampling-based strategies only partially mitigate this issue.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback, after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly, even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in self-improvement.

"LLMs show resistance to feedback, termed feedback friction, even under ideal conditions, and sampling-based strategies only partially mitigate this issue.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback, after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly, even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in self-improvement."

A novel candidate annotation paradigm using a teacher-student framework improves data quality for下游 applications by encouraging large language models to output multiple labels when uncertain.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for data annotation, markedly reducing the labor costs associated with downstream applications. However, existing methods mostly adopt an aggressive strategy by prompting LLM to determine a single gold label for each unlabeled sample. Due to the inherent uncertainty within LLMs, they often produce incorrect labels for difficult samples, severely compromising the data quality for downstream applications. Motivated by ambiguity aversion in human behaviors, we propose a novel candidate annotation paradigm wherein large language models are encouraged to output all possible labels when incurring uncertainty. To ensure unique labels are provided for downstream tasks, we develop a teacher-student framework CanDist that distills candidate annotations with a Small Language Model (SLM). We further provide a rigorous justification demonstrating that distilling candidate annotations from the teacher LLM offers superior theoretical guarantees compared to directly using single annotations. Extensive experiments across six text classification tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is available at https://github.com/MingxuanXia/CanDist.
