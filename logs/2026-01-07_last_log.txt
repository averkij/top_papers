Farr, Stefan Doerr, Antonio Mirarchi, Francesc Sabanes Zariquiey, and Gianni De Fabritiis,, Acellera Labs, Dr Trueta 183, 08005, Barcelona, Spain Computational Science Laboratory, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona Biomedical Research Park (PRBB), Dr. Aiguader 88, 08003, Barcelona, Spain Acellera, 38350 Fremont Blvd 203 Fremont CA, 94536 USA Institucio Catalana de Recerca Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Passeig Lluis Companys 23, 08010 Barcelona, Spain E-mail: g.defabritiis@gmail.com Abstract We introduce AceFF, pre-trained machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) optimized for small molecule drug discovery. While MLIPs have emerged as eﬃcient alternatives to Density Functional Theory (DFT), generalizability across diverse chemical spaces remains diﬃcult. AceFF addresses this via reﬁned TensorNet2 architecture trained on comprehensive dataset of drug-like compounds. This approach yields force ﬁeld that balances high-throughput inference speed with DFT-level accuracy. AceFF fully supports the essential medicinal chemistry elements (H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, I) and is explicitly trained to handle charged states. Validation against rigorous benchmarks, including complex torsional energy scans, molecular dynamics trajectories, batched minimizations, and forces and anergy accuracy demonstrates that AceFF 1 establishes new state-of-the-art for organic molecules. The AceFF-2 model weights and inference code are available at https://huggingface.co/Acellera/AceFF-2.0. Atomistic simulations are fundamental tools for understanding materials and molecular systems at the atomic level. The accuracy and utility of these simulations critically depend on the choice of force ﬁeld. Classical molecular mechanics (MM) force ﬁelds such as GAFF, 1,2 CGenFF, 3,4 OpenFF, 5,6 and AMBER 7 oﬀer high computational eﬃciency, but often fall short in predictive accuracy, particularly for d"

Concord, USA gbzan@sigray.com AbstractImage dehazing is critical challenge in computer vision, essential for enhancing image clarity in hazy conditions. Traditional methods often rely on atmospheric scattering models, while recent deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have improved performance by effectively analyzing image features. However, CNNs struggle with longrange dependencies, and Transformers demand significant computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose DehazeSNN, an that integrates U-Net-like design with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). DehazeSNN captures multi-scale image features while efficiently managing local and long-range dependencies. The introduction of the Orthogonal Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire Block (OLIFBlock) enhances cross-channel communication, resulting in superior dehazing performance with reduced computational burden. Our extensive experiments show that DehazeSNN is highly competitive to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, delivering high-quality haze-fr"

We introduce AceFF, a pre-trained machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) optimized for small molecule drug discovery. While MLIPs have emerged as efficient alternatives to Density Functional Theory (DFT), generalizability across diverse chemical spaces remains difficult. AceFF addresses this via a refined TensorNet2 architecture trained on a comprehensive dataset of drug-like compounds. This approach yields a force field that balances high-throughput inference speed with DFT-level accuracy. AceFF fully supports the essential medicinal chemistry elements (H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, I) and is explicitly trained to handle charged states. Validation against rigorous benchmarks, including complex torsional energy scans, molecular dynamics trajectories, batched minimizations, and forces and anergy accuracy demonstrates that AceFF establishes a new state-of-the-art for organic molecules. The AceFF-2 model weights and inference code are available at https://huggingface.co/Acellera/AceFF-2.0.

DehazeSNN combines a U-Net-like architecture with Spiking Neural Networks and an Orthogonal Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire Block to achieve efficient and effective image dehazing with reduced computational resources.  					AI-generated summary 				 Image dehazing is a critical challenge in computer vision, essential for enhancing image clarity in hazy conditions. Traditional methods often rely on atmospheric scattering models, while recent deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have improved performance by effectively analyzing image features. However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, and Transformers demand significant computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose DehazeSNN, an innovative architecture that integrates a U-Net-like design with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). DehazeSNN captures multi-scale image features while efficiently managing local and long-range dependencies. The introduction of the Orthogonal Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire Block (OLIFBlock) enhances cross-channel communication, resulting in superior dehazing performance with reduced computational burden. Our extensive experiments show that DehazeSNN is highly competitive to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, delivering high-quality haze-free images with a smaller model size and less multiply-accumulate operations. The proposed dehazing method is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoranLiu507/DehazeSNN.
