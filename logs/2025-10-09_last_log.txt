Our work identifies core factors of the vibe check, providing concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that better align with user preferences in coding. 1. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped how humans write code, fostering workflow termed vibe coding (Karpathy, 2025; Willison, 2025). In this paradigm, AIs role shifts from one-shot code completion tool for developers to an interactive collaborator for broader audience, including users with limited coding experience. Through multi-turn natural language interactions, users can create and refine solutions from scratch, requiring the model to maintain context, adapt to evolving requirements, and iteratively improve the code until it meets their needs (Ross et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023). The users final accept/reject choice serves as real-time evaluation: what we call the vibe check, subjective preference typically based on whether the solution feels right, reads cleanly, avoids obvious issues or anti-patterns, and preserves intent and correct functionality. This collaborative workflow, popularized by tools such as Copilot1 and Cursor2, is rapidly becoming standard practice in modern software development (Peng et al., 2023; Stack Overflow, 2025). Despite the shift toward vibe coding, existing code evaluation remains anchored to functional correctness, typically measured as pass@k (Austin et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Jimenez et al., 2024). These metrics indicate whether code passes unit tests but abstract away non-functional expectations that users apply when selecting response, including adherence to project conventions, documentation clarity, minimal and targeted edits, and preservation of prior intent across interactions. This disconnection is evident in platforms such as Copilot Arena (Chi et al., 2025), large-scale vibe-checking scenario where human programmers choose preferred candidate snippets. Strikingly, 1https://github.com/features/copilot 2https://cursor.com Corresponding author(s): mingz5@illinois.edu and jiaosun@google.com Ming Zhong and Jiawei Han (UIUC); Ting-Yun Chang (USC). Work done while at Google DeepMind. 2025 Google DeepMind. All rights reserved Vibe Checker: Aligning Code Evaluation with Human Preference Figure 1 Vibe check goes beyond functionality, requiring code to satisfy non-functional instructions such as coding style and logic patterns, which are also key factors of human preference. rankings of code LLMs from Copilot Arena exhibit weak or negative correlations with functional scores on popular benchmarks. Moreover, pass@k remains dominant verifiable reward signal in RLVR training (Da et al., 2025; DeepSeek-AI, 2025), steering optimization toward an incomplete notion of code quality. Consequently, models can achieve high leaderboard scores yet fail the vibe check in practice, producing code that is technically correct but misaligned with user preferences. To bridge this gap, we hypothesize that the non-functional signals emerging from interactions are an important, yet under-measured, component of the vibe check. We first introduce VeriCode, taxonomy of verifiable code instructions designed to capture what users routinely screen for during code selection. Grounded in hundreds of rules from industrial linters and style guides, we perform manual curation and automated filtering to distill core set of 30 instructions across five categories. Each instruction is paired with verifier implemented using standard linters and abstract syntax tree analysis. These verifiers yield binary pass or fail score, enabling reliable automatic evaluation while also providing verifiable and scalable reward source for model training. Building on VeriCode, we augment established benchmarks, BigCodeBench (Zhuo et al., 2025) and LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2025), with these verifiable instructions to better simulate real-world interactions. We refer to the augmented variants as BigVibeBench and LiveVibeBench. For each user query, an LLM-driven selector chooses relevant and non-conflicting subset of instructions from our taxonomy to add as explicit constraints. Functional unit tests together with our instruction verifiers constitute unified testbed, Vibe Checker, which measures both functional correctness and instruction following (IF). Using this testbed, we evaluate 31 LLMs from 10 model families in two realistic settings: single-turn generation, in which the model must satisfy all constraints in one pass, and multi-turn editing, in which constraints are introduced sequentially while preserving prior intent. This setup allows us to study both dimensions across interaction contexts. Our analysis on Vibe Checker testbed yields several key insights into the code evaluation: Non-functional instructio"

Inspired by the Multi-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce memory framework of artificial neural networks. Our method maintains sliding window of the Transformers KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while learnable module termed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses out-of-window information into fixed-size compact long-term memory. To validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and GatedDeltaNet. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. Correspondence: Weihao Yu at weihao.yu@bytedance.com Code: https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/AHN Models: https://huggingface.co/ByteDance-Seed Work done while at ByteDance Seed.Memory is the treasury and guardian of all things [15]. Inspired by the fundamental role of memory in intelligence, researchers have long sought to model this cognitive function in artificial systems. Early efforts centered on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [14, 23, 29, 33], where sequential information is encoded by continuously updated hidden states. Over time, diverse paradigms for memory representation emerged, including key-value (KV) caches in attention mechanisms [80], external memory modules in Neural Turing Machines and Memory Networks [27, 86], and external databases for retrieval-augmented models [43]. Among these, RNN-like and attention-based models have become the most widely used, each offering distinct advantages and limitations [48, 102]. RNN-like models compress all historical information into fixed-size hidden state, which can be treated as memory. At each step, they update the memory using the current input and the previous memory. This design ensures constant memory and computation per step, making them efficient for long sequences. However, compressing all information into fixed-size memory inevitably leads to information loss, especially in tasks that require precise long-range information recall [85]. To address the limitations of RNNs, attention mechanisms and the Transformer architecture are introduced [6, 54, 80]. In causal attention, the key-value cache functions as memory: for each input token, new key and value are generated and appended to the cache. Unlike RNNs, this memory is essentially lossless, as it retains all token-level information, thereby providing much higher memory capacity. The introduction of the Transformer quickly revolutionized sequence modeling, giving rise to series of powerful models [11, 20, 59, 66, 67]. Yet, the lossless nature of KV cache is double-edged sword: while it enables powerful memory retention, the memory size grows linearly with sequence length, and the total computational cost of attention updates scales quadratically. This becomes significant challenge when processing extremely long sequences. When Transformers with growing lossless memory struggle for very long sequences, it is natural to revisit the RNNs fixed-size compressed memory, which offers constant per-token update cost regardless of context length [29, 41, 96]. This contrast highlights fundamental trade-off between the efficiency of compressive memory and the fidelity of lossless memory. To address this problem, it is instructive to consider how the human brain maintains nearly constant volume through early and middle adulthood [16, 19, 25] while still supporting efficient processing of information across the human lifespan. The theory of Multi-Store Model of memory (MSM) in Cognitive Science and Neuroscience [4] suggests that although lossless short-term memory (or called working memory [5]) has limited capacity and duration [4, 56, 65], the hippocampus continually consolidates them into long-term cortical representations [3, 55, 71, 75, 78]. Inspired by MSM [4], we propose an artificial neural memory framework that converts lossless short-term memory into compressed long-term memory. Our method maintains sliding window of the Transformers KV cache as lossless short-term memory. Information that moves beyond this window is processed by learnable compression module we term the Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN). This network recurrently compresses the out-of-window context into fixed-size state as the long-term compressed memory. AHNs can be instantiated with RNN-like architectures, and the overall framework is illustrated in Figure 1a. To evaluate the effectiveness of AHNs, we instantiate them using Mamba2 [18], DeltaNet (DN) [70, 97] and GatedDeltaNet (GDN) [98], resulting in the AHN-Mamba2, AHN-DN and AHN-GDN. Experimental results on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval [103] and InfiniteBench [105] show that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform their sliding window counterparts, and match or even surpass full attention model"

Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce novel metric, U-Score, which jointly captures the performanceefficiency trade-off, offering deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we propose model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary, U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the next decade of"

[ 1 9 9 9 4 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r Abstract Text-to-video (T2V) generation technology holds immense potential to transform multiple domains such as education, marketing, entertainment, and assistive technologies for individuals with visual or reading comprehension challenges, by creating coherent visual content from natural language prompts. From its inception, the field has advanced from adversarial models to diffusion-based models, yielding higher-fidelity, more temporally consistent outputs. Yet multiple challenges still persist in these domains, such as alignment, long-range coherence, and computational efficiency. Addressing this evolving landscape, we present comprehensive survey of text-to-video generative models, tracing their development from early GANs and VAEs to current hybrid Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) architectures, detailing how these models work internally, what limitations they addressed in their predecessors, and why shifts toward new architectural paradigms were necessary to overcome challenges in quality, coherence, and control. We provide systematic account of the datasets, which the surveyed text-to-video models were trained and evaluated on, and, to support reproducibility and assess the accessibility of training such models, we detail their training configurations, including their hardware specifications, GPU counts, batch sizes, learning rates, optimizers, epochs, and other key hyperparameters. Further, we outline the evaluation metrics commonly used for evaluating such models and present their performance across standard benchmarks, while also discussing the limitations of these metrics and the emerging shift toward more holistic, perception-aligned evaluation strategies.

Vibe Checker evaluates LLMs by combining functional correctness and instruction following to better align with human coding preferences.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed vibe coding, where users leverage LLMs to generate and iteratively refine code through natural language interactions until it passes their vibe check. Vibe check is tied to real-world human preference and goes beyond functionality: the solution should feel right, read cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct. However, current code evaluation remains anchored to pass@k and captures only functional correctness, overlooking the non-functional instructions that users routinely apply. In this paper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing piece underlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besides functional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction following capabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30 verifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministic verifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites, resulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction following and functional correctness. Upon evaluating 31 leading LLMs, we show that even the strongest models struggle to comply with multiple instructions and exhibit clear functional regression. Most importantly, a composite score of functional correctness and instruction following correlates the best with human preference, with the latter emerging as the primary differentiator on real-world programming tasks. Our work identifies core factors of the vibe check, providing a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that better align with user preferences in coding.

SHANKS, a general inference framework, enables spoken language models to generate unspoken reasoning while listening to user input, enhancing real-time interaction and task completion.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current large language models (LLMs) and spoken language models (SLMs) begin thinking and taking actions only after the user has finished their turn. This prevents the model from interacting during the user's turn and can lead to high response latency while it waits to think. Consequently, thinking after receiving the full input is not suitable for speech-to-speech interaction, where real-time, low-latency exchange is important. We address this by noting that humans naturally "think while listening." In this paper, we propose SHANKS, a general inference framework that enables SLMs to generate unspoken chain-of-thought reasoning while listening to the user input. SHANKS streams the input speech in fixed-duration chunks and, as soon as a chunk is received, generates unspoken reasoning based on all previous speech and reasoning, while the user continues speaking. SHANKS uses this unspoken reasoning to decide whether to interrupt the user and to make tool calls to complete the task. We demonstrate that SHANKS enhances real-time user-SLM interaction in two scenarios: (1) when the user is presenting a step-by-step solution to a math problem, SHANKS can listen, reason, and interrupt when the user makes a mistake, achieving 37.1% higher interruption accuracy than a baseline that interrupts without thinking; and (2) in a tool-augmented dialogue, SHANKS can complete 56.9% of the tool calls before the user finishes their turn. Overall, SHANKS moves toward models that keep thinking throughout the conversation, not only after a turn ends. Animated illustrations of Shanks can be found at https://d223302.github.io/SHANKS/

"SHANKS, a general inference framework, enables spoken language models to generate unspoken reasoning while listening to user input, enhancing real-time interaction and task completion.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current large language models (LLMs) and spoken language models (SLMs) begin thinking and taking actions only after the user has finished their turn. This prevents the model from interacting during the user's turn and can lead to high response latency while it waits to think. Consequently, thinking after receiving the full input is not suitable for speech-to-speech interaction, where real-time, low-latency exchange is important. We address this by noting that humans naturally "think while listening." In this paper, we propose SHANKS, a general inference framework that enables SLMs to generate unspoken chain-of-thought reasoning while listening to the user input. SHANKS streams the input speech in fixed-duration chunks and, as soon as a chunk is received, generates unspoken reasoning based on all previous speech and reasoning, while the user continues speaking. SHANKS uses this unspoken reasoning to decide whether to interrupt the user and to make tool calls to complete the task. We demonstrate that SHANKS enhances real-time user-SLM interaction in two scenarios: (1) when the user is presenting a step-by-step solution to a math problem, SHANKS can listen, reason, and interrupt when the user makes a mistake, achieving 37.1% higher interruption accuracy than a baseline that interrupts without thinking; and (2) in a tool-augmented dialogue, SHANKS can complete 56.9% of the tool calls before the user finishes their turn. Overall, SHANKS moves toward models that keep thinking throughout the conversation, not only after a turn ends. Animated illustrations of Shanks can be found at https://d223302.github.io/SHANKS/"

MATPO, a reinforcement learning method, optimizes tool-integrated multi-agent roles within a single LLM, improving performance and robustness over single-agent systems.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on multi-turn tool-integrated planning for knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks. Existing implementations typically rely on a single agent, but they suffer from limited context length and noisy tool responses. A natural solution is to adopt a multi-agent framework with planner- and worker-agents to manage context. However, no existing methods support effective reinforcement learning post-training of tool-integrated multi-agent frameworks. To address this gap, we propose Multi-Agent Tool-Integrated Policy Optimization (MATPO), which enables distinct roles (planner and worker) to be trained within a single LLM instance using role-specific prompts via reinforcement learning. MATPO is derived from a principled credit assignment mechanism across planner and worker rollouts. This design eliminates the need to deploy multiple LLMs, which would be memory-intensive, while preserving the benefits of specialization. Experiments on GAIA-text, WebWalkerQA, and FRAMES show that MATPO consistently outperforms single-agent baselines by an average of 18.38% relative improvement in performance and exhibits greater robustness to noisy tool outputs. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of unifying multiple agent roles within a single LLM and provide practical insights for stable and efficient multi-agent RL training.

A memory framework combining short-term and long-term memory in neural networks improves long-sequence modeling efficiency and performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-sequence modeling faces a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency of compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity of lossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers. Inspired by the Multi-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of artificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the Transformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module termed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses out-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance, augmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5% and memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k sequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88.

Cache-to-Cache (C2C) enables direct semantic communication between LLMs using neural network projections, improving accuracy and reducing latency compared to text-based communication.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size, supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus, we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5% higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average 2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/C2C.

"Cache-to-Cache (C2C) enables direct semantic communication between LLMs using neural network projections, improving accuracy and reducing latency compared to text-based communication.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size, supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus, we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5% higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average 2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/C2C."

Context Denoising Training (CDT) improves long-context models' performance by mitigating contextual noise and enhancing attention on critical tokens.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-context models (LCMs) have demonstrated great potential in processing long sequences, facilitating many real-world applications. The success of LCMs can be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information within the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals that LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens, that can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority of CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).

Low-precision training of transformer models with flash attention suffers from catastrophic loss explosions due to low-rank representations and biased rounding errors, which are addressed by a minimal modification to the flash attention mechanism.  					AI-generated summary 				 The pursuit of computational efficiency has driven the adoption of low-precision formats for training transformer models. However, this progress is often hindered by notorious training instabilities. This paper provides the first mechanistic explanation for a long-standing and unresolved failure case where training with flash attention in low-precision settings leads to catastrophic loss explosions. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the failure is not a random artifact but caused by two intertwined phenomena: the emergence of similar low-rank representations within the attention mechanism and the compounding effect of biased rounding errors inherent in low-precision arithmetic. We demonstrate how these factors create a vicious cycle of error accumulation that corrupts weight updates, ultimately derailing the training dynamics. To validate our findings, we introduce a minimal modification to the flash attention that mitigates the bias in rounding errors. This simple change stabilizes the training process, confirming our analysis and offering a practical solution to this persistent problem.

To answer this, we curate MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers. Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation. We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations validate our design choices. Codes and weights will be released.

U-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities, focusing on statistical robustness, zero-shot generalization, and computational efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical image segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped variants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric, U-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering a deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we propose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary, U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models.

A novel method using Discrete Distribution Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) detects images generated by visual autoregressive models by analyzing codebook frequency statistics and quantization errors.  					AI-generated summary 				 The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection. Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D^3QE) for autoregressive-generated image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and strong generalization of D^3QE across different AR models, with robustness to real-world perturbations.

A survey of text-to-video generative models from GANs and VAEs to hybrid Diffusion-Transformer architectures, detailing their development, limitations, and future directions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-video (T2V) generation technology holds potential to transform multiple domains such as education, marketing, entertainment, and assistive technologies for individuals with visual or reading comprehension challenges, by creating coherent visual content from natural language prompts. From its inception, the field has advanced from adversarial models to diffusion-based models, yielding higher-fidelity, temporally consistent outputs. Yet challenges persist, such as alignment, long-range coherence, and computational efficiency. Addressing this evolving landscape, we present a comprehensive survey of text-to-video generative models, tracing their development from early GANs and VAEs to hybrid Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) architectures, detailing how these models work, what limitations they addressed in their predecessors, and why shifts toward new architectural paradigms were necessary to overcome challenges in quality, coherence, and control. We provide a systematic account of the datasets, which the surveyed text-to-video models were trained and evaluated on, and, to support reproducibility and assess the accessibility of training such models, we detail their training configurations, including their hardware specifications, GPU counts, batch sizes, learning rates, optimizers, epochs, and other key hyperparameters. Further, we outline the evaluation metrics commonly used for evaluating such models and present their performance across standard benchmarks, while also discussing the limitations of these metrics and the emerging shift toward more holistic, perception-aligned evaluation strategies. Finally, drawing from our analysis, we outline the current open challenges and propose a few promising future directions, laying out a perspective for future researchers to explore and build upon in advancing T2V research and applications.
