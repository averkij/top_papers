Text:"NorMuon: Making Muon more efficient and scalable Zichong Li 1, Liming Liu1, Chen Liang2, Weizhu Chen2, Tuo Zhao1 1Georgia Tech 2Microsoft Abstract The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite Muons emergence as candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly leveraging their strengthshas not been systematically explored. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process. NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving Muons conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices. Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1B pretraining setting, while maintaining comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale deep learning. We open-source our implementation at https://github.com/zichongli5/NorMuon.git. 5 2 0 2 7 ] . [ 1 1 9 4 5 0 . "

An unsupervised method learns a compact state representation using a lightweight encoder and Diffusion Transformer decoder, improving robotic performance and enabling latent action decoding from static images.  					AI-generated summary 				 A fundamental challenge in embodied intelligence is developing expressive and compact state representations for efficient world modeling and decision making. However, existing methods often fail to achieve this balance, yielding representations that are either overly redundant or lacking in task-critical information. We propose an unsupervised approach that learns a highly compressed two-token state representation using a lightweight encoder and a pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder, capitalizing on its strong generative prior. Our representation is efficient, interpretable, and integrates seamlessly into existing VLA-based models, improving performance by 14.3% on LIBERO and 30% in real-world task success with minimal inference overhead. More importantly, we find that the difference between these tokens, obtained via latent interpolation, naturally serves as a highly effective latent action, which can be further decoded into executable robot actions. This emergent capability reveals that our representation captures structured dynamics without explicit supervision. We name our method StaMo for its ability to learn generalizable robotic Motion from compact State representation, which is encoded from static images, challenging the prevalent dependence to learning latent action on complex architectures and video data. The resulting latent actions also enhance policy co-training, outperforming prior methods by 10.4% with improved interpretability. Moreover, our approach scales effectively across diverse data sources, including real-world robot data, simulation, and human egocentric video.

Heptapod, an image autoregressive model using causal attention and next 2D distribution prediction, achieves superior performance on ImageNet generation by combining sequential modeling with holistic self-supervised learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Heptapod, an image autoregressive model that adheres to the foundational principles of language modeling. Heptapod employs causal attention, eliminates reliance on CFG, and eschews the trend of semantic tokenizers. Our key innovation is next 2D distribution prediction: a causal Transformer with reconstruction-focused visual tokenizer, learns to predict the distribution over the entire 2D spatial grid of images at each timestep. This learning objective unifies the sequential modeling of autoregressive framework with the holistic self-supervised learning of masked autoencoding, enabling the model to capture comprehensive image semantics via generative training. On the ImageNet generation benchmark, Heptapod achieves an FID of 2.70, significantly outperforming previous causal autoregressive approaches. We hope our work inspires a principled rethinking of language modeling on visual signals and beyond.

"Heptapod, an image autoregressive model using causal attention and next 2D distribution prediction, achieves superior performance on ImageNet generation by combining sequential modeling with holistic self-supervised learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Heptapod, an image autoregressive model that adheres to the foundational principles of language modeling. Heptapod employs causal attention, eliminates reliance on CFG, and eschews the trend of semantic tokenizers. Our key innovation is next 2D distribution prediction: a causal Transformer with reconstruction-focused visual tokenizer, learns to predict the distribution over the entire 2D spatial grid of images at each timestep. This learning objective unifies the sequential modeling of autoregressive framework with the holistic self-supervised learning of masked autoencoding, enabling the model to capture comprehensive image semantics via generative training. On the ImageNet generation benchmark, Heptapod achieves an FID of 2.70, significantly outperforming previous causal autoregressive approaches. We hope our work inspires a principled rethinking of language modeling on visual signals and beyond."

NorMuon, a novel optimizer combining orthogonalization with neuron-level adaptive learning rates, enhances training efficiency and balances parameter utilization in large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process. NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices. Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale deep learning.

Авторы обнаружили, что хотя оптимизатор Muon улучшает геометрию оптимизации через ортогонализацию, он создаёт дисбаланс в нормах нейронов, из-за чего некоторые нейроны доминируют в процессе обучения. NorMuon решает эту проблему, применяя построчную нормализацию после ортогонализации и сохраняя статистику второго порядка для каждого нейрона. Эксперименты показали улучшение эффективности обучения на 21.74% по сравнению с Adam и на 11.31% по сравнению с Muon на модели размером 1.1B параметров.",
