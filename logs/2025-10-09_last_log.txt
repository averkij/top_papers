Text:"BACHI: BOUNDARY-AWARE SYMBOLIC CHORD RECOGNITION THROUGH MASKED ITERATIVE DECODING ON POP AND CLASSICAL MUSIC Mingyang Yao, Ke Chen, Shlomo Dubnov, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick University of California San Diego, USA 5 2 0 2 8 ] . [ 1 8 2 5 6 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r ABSTRACT Automatic chord recognition (ACR) via deep learning models has gradually achieved promising recognition accuracy, yet two key challenges remain. First, prior work has primarily focused on audiodomain ACR, while symbolic music (e.g., score) ACR has received limited attention due to data scarcity. Second, existing methods still overlook strategies that are aligned with human music analytical practices. To address these challenges, we make two contributions: (1) we introduce POP909-CL, an enhanced version of POP909 dataset with tempo-aligned content and human-corrected labels of chords, beats, keys, and time signatures; and (2) We propose BACHI, symbolic chord recognition model that decomposes the task into different decision steps, namely boundary detection and iterative ranking of chord root, quality, and bass (inversion). This mechanism mirrors the human ear-training practices. Experiments demonstrate that BACHI achieves state-of-the-art chord recognition performance on both classical and pop music benchmarks, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each module. Index Terms Symbolic Chord Recognition, Iterative Decoding, POP909 Annotation, Music Information Retrieval 1. INTRODUCTION Automatic chord recognition (ACR) is fundamental task in music information retrieval that aims to annotate music with chord labels over time. Recent breakthroughs in machine learning have shown that ACR models with deep neural networks outperform conventional approaches. Chord recognition also underpins wide range of downstream applications, including harmonic analysis, annotation for controllable music generation, and music education. Despite recent promising progress, symbolic chord recognition remains underexplor"

INTRODUCTION Hair is central to personal identity and self-esteem [1], [2], yet routine care is difficult for individuals with limited mobility due to reduced coordination, strength, and flexibility [3]. To improve accessibility and autonomy, robot hair care systems have been explored [4][7], but existing approaches rely on either handcrafted trajectories or rulebased controllers, restricting generalization across diverse hairstyles and goals. To address these limitations, we propose DYMO-Hair, model-based robot hair care system. Our system is capable of generalizable and flexible visual goal-conditioned hair manipulation, across diverse hairstyles and objectives in unconstrained physical environments. At the core of our system 1 Chengyang Zhao, Uksang Yoo, Jonathan Francis (by courtesy), Jeffrey Ichnowski, and Jean Oh are with Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. {chengyaz, uyoo, jmf1, jichnows, hyaejino}@andrew.cmu.edu 2 Arkadeep Narayan Chaudhury is with Epic Games, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. arkadeep.chaudhury@epicgames.com 3 Giljoo Nam is with Meta Codec Avatars Lab, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. giljoonam@meta.com 4 Jonathan Francis is with Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. Fig. 1. DYMO-HAIR Overview. We introduce DYMO-Hair, unified, model-based robot hair care system. We propose the first 3D volumetric haircombing dynamics model, featuring novel learning paradigm. It uses an action-conditioned latent state editing mechanism, coupled with compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles, enabled by our novel hair-combing simulator, for generalizable dynamics modeling. Building on this model, we develop DYMO-Hair with MPPI-based planner for closed-loop visual goal-conditioned hair styling. is dynamics model that captures diverse hair deformations across various hairstyles and combing motions. For deformable objects like hair, complex structures and unobservable properties make accurate dynamics modeling difficult. While analytical physics-based models exist, they are computationally expensive and impractical for realtime control, motivating the use of learning-based neural dynamics as proxies [8][10]. However, hair poses unique challenges: 1) Representation. Low-resolution point clouds cannot capture strand-level geometry. 2) Structure. Graphbased methods scale poorly as point counts increase for higher resolution. 3) Supervision. Global metrics miss finescale deformations, while point-wise correspondence is impractical for strands. 4) Data. Hair entanglement makes realworld data collection slow and difficult to reset across styles. To address these challenges, we introduce novel paradigm for generalizable volumetric hair dynamics modeling. We present the first 3D hair-combing dynamics model that leverages large-scale diverse synthetic data for hair dynamics learning and generalizes across various hairstyles. We represent hair as high-resolution volumetric occupancy grid with 3D orientation field to capture both hair position and local strand flow, which offers more geometric details and structural information of hair than sparse point clouds. It also allows dense supervision on both occupancy and orientation, providing sufficient local signals for the model to capture fine-grained deformations during learning. Our key innovation, inspired by ControlNet [11], is to pre-train compact 3D latent space for diverse hair states and to introduce control branch that models dynamics as actionconditioned state editing, enabling significantly improved generalizability through large-scale pre-training. To avoid time-consuming real-world data collection required by the pre-training, we further develop hair-combing simulator based on Genesis [12]. It leverages novel formulation of the position-based dynamics (PBD) method for strandlevel, contact-rich hair simulation, enabling efficient largescale generation of visually-realistic and physically-plausible synthetic dynamics data across diverse hairstyles. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines on generalizable hair dynamics modeling for local hair deformation across diverse unseen hairstyles. Building on our dynamics model, we introduce DYMOHair, unified, model-based robot hair care system for visual goal-conditioned hair styling. We adopt Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, using Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)-based planner to optimize an action trajectory that minimizes the geometric distance between predicted "

BACHI, a symbolic chord recognition model, achieves state-of-the-art performance by decomposing the task into boundary detection and iterative ranking, using an enhanced POP909-CL dataset.  					AI-generated summary 				 Automatic chord recognition (ACR) via deep learning models has gradually achieved promising recognition accuracy, yet two key challenges remain. First, prior work has primarily focused on audio-domain ACR, while symbolic music (e.g., score) ACR has received limited attention due to data scarcity. Second, existing methods still overlook strategies that are aligned with human music analytical practices. To address these challenges, we make two contributions: (1) we introduce POP909-CL, an enhanced version of POP909 dataset with tempo-aligned content and human-corrected labels of chords, beats, keys, and time signatures; and (2) We propose BACHI, a symbolic chord recognition model that decomposes the task into different decision steps, namely boundary detection and iterative ranking of chord root, quality, and bass (inversion). This mechanism mirrors the human ear-training practices. Experiments demonstrate that BACHI achieves state-of-the-art chord recognition performance on both classical and pop music benchmarks, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each module.

"BACHI, a symbolic chord recognition model, achieves state-of-the-art performance by decomposing the task into boundary detection and iterative ranking, using an enhanced POP909-CL dataset.  					AI-generated summary 				 Automatic chord recognition (ACR) via deep learning models has gradually achieved promising recognition accuracy, yet two key challenges remain. First, prior work has primarily focused on audio-domain ACR, while symbolic music (e.g., score) ACR has received limited attention due to data scarcity. Second, existing methods still overlook strategies that are aligned with human music analytical practices. To address these challenges, we make two contributions: (1) we introduce POP909-CL, an enhanced version of POP909 dataset with tempo-aligned content and human-corrected labels of chords, beats, keys, and time signatures; and (2) We propose BACHI, a symbolic chord recognition model that decomposes the task into different decision steps, namely boundary detection and iterative ranking of chord root, quality, and bass (inversion). This mechanism mirrors the human ear-training practices. Experiments demonstrate that BACHI achieves state-of-the-art chord recognition performance on both classical and pop music benchmarks, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each module."

MEMTRACK is a benchmark for evaluating long-term memory and state tracking in multi-platform agent environments, focusing on dynamic enterprise settings and providing metrics for correctness, efficiency, and redundancy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy, conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\% Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent, multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

DYMO-Hair, a model-based robot hair care system, uses a novel dynamics learning paradigm and a 3D latent space to perform visual goal-conditioned hair styling with high accuracy and generalizability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Hair care is an essential daily activity, yet it remains inaccessible to individuals with limited mobility and challenging for autonomous robot systems due to the fine-grained physical structure and complex dynamics of hair. In this work, we present DYMO-Hair, a model-based robot hair care system. We introduce a novel dynamics learning paradigm that is suited for volumetric quantities such as hair, relying on an action-conditioned latent state editing mechanism, coupled with a compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles to improve generalizability. This latent space is pre-trained at scale using a novel hair physics simulator, enabling generalization across previously unseen hairstyles. Using the dynamics model with a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) planner, DYMO-Hair is able to perform visual goal-conditioned hair styling. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that DYMO-Hair's dynamics model outperforms baselines on capturing local deformation for diverse, unseen hairstyles. DYMO-Hair further outperforms baselines in closed-loop hair styling tasks on unseen hairstyles, with an average of 22% lower final geometric error and 42% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art system. Real-world experiments exhibit zero-shot transferability of our system to wigs, achieving consistent success on challenging unseen hairstyles where the state-of-the-art system fails. Together, these results introduce a foundation for model-based robot hair care, advancing toward more generalizable, flexible, and accessible robot hair styling in unconstrained physical environments.

We introduce a novel dynamics learning paradigm that is suited for volumetric quantities such as hair, relying on an action-conditioned latent state editing mechanism, coupled with a compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles to improve generalizability. This latent space is pre-trained at scale using a novel hair physics simulator, enabling generalization across previously unseen hairstyles. Using the dynamics model with a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) planner, DYMO-Hair is able to perform visual goal-conditioned hair styling. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that DYMO-Hair's dynamics model outperforms baselines on capturing local deformation for diverse, unseen hairstyles. DYMO-Hair further outperforms baselines in closed-loop hair styling tasks on unseen hairstyles, with an average of 22% lower final geometric error and 42% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art system. Real-world experiments exhibit zero-shot transferability of our system to wigs, achieving consistent success on challenging unseen hairstyles where the state-of-the-art system fails. Together, these results introduce a foundation for model-based robot hair care, advancing toward more generalizable, flexible, and accessible robot hair styling in unconstrained physical environments.
