Our work identifies core factors of the vibe check, providing concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that better align with user preferences in coding. 1. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped how humans write code, fostering workflow termed vibe coding (Karpathy, 2025; Willison, 2025). In this paradigm, AIs role shifts from one-shot code completion tool for developers to an interactive collaborator for broader audience, including users with limited coding experience. Through multi-turn natural language interactions, users can create and refine solutions from scratch, requiring the model to maintain context, adapt to evolving requirements, and iteratively improve the code until it meets their needs (Ross et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023). The users final accept/reject choice serves as real-time evaluation: what we call the vibe check, subjective preference typically based on whether the solution feels right, reads cleanly, avoids obvious issues or anti-patterns, and preserves intent and correct functionality. This collaborative workflow, popularized by tools such as Copilot1 and Cursor2, is rapidly becoming standard practice in modern software development (Peng et al., 2023; Stack Overflow, 2025). Despite the shift toward vibe coding, existing code evaluation remains anchored to functional correctness, typically measured as pass@k (Austin et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Jimenez et al., 2024). These metrics indicate whether code passes unit tests but abstract away non-functional expectations that users apply when selecting response, including adherence to project conventions, documentation clarity, minimal and targeted edits, and preservation of prior intent across interactions. This disconnection is evident in platforms such as Copilot Arena (Chi et al., 2025), large-scale vibe-checking scenario where human programmers choose preferred candidate snippets. Strikingly, 1https://github.com/features/copilot 2https://cursor.com Corresponding author(s): mingz5@illinois.edu and jiaosun@google.com Ming Zhong and Jiawei Han (UIUC); Ting-Yun Chang (USC). Work done while at Google DeepMind. 2025 Google DeepMind. All rights reserved Vibe Checker: Aligning Code Evaluation with Human Preference Figure 1 Vibe check goes beyond functionality, requiring code to satisfy non-functional instructions such as coding style and logic patterns, which are also key factors of human preference. rankings of code LLMs from Copilot Arena exhibit weak or negative correlations with functional scores on popular benchmarks. Moreover, pass@k remains dominant verifiable reward signal in RLVR training (Da et al., 2025; DeepSeek-AI, 2025), steering optimization toward an incomplete notion of code quality. Consequently, models can achieve high leaderboard scores yet fail the vibe check in practice, producing code that is technically correct but misaligned with user preferences. To bridge this gap, we hypothesize that the non-functional signals emerging from interactions are an important, yet under-measured, component of the vibe check. We first introduce VeriCode, taxonomy of verifiable code instructions designed to capture what users routinely screen for during code selection. Grounded in hundreds of rules from industrial linters and style guides, we perform manual curation and automated filtering to distill core set of 30 instructions across five categories. Each instruction is paired with verifier implemented using standard linters and abstract syntax tree analysis. These verifiers yield binary pass or fail score, enabling reliable automatic evaluation while also providing verifiable and scalable reward source for model training. Building on VeriCode, we augment established benchmarks, BigCodeBench (Zhuo et al., 2025) and LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2025), with these verifiable instructions to better simulate real-world interactions. We refer to the augmented variants as BigVibeBench and LiveVibeBench. For each user query, an LLM-driven selector chooses relevant and non-conflicting subset of instructions from our taxonomy to add as explicit constraints. Functional unit tests together with our instruction verifiers constitute unified testbed, Vibe Checker, which measures both functional correctness and instruction following (IF). Using this testbed, we evaluate 31 LLMs from 10 model families in two realistic settings: single-turn generation, in which the model must satisfy all constraints in one pass, and multi-turn editing, in which constraints are introduced sequentially while preserving prior intent. This setup allows us to study both dimensions across interaction contexts. Our analysis on Vibe Checker testbed yields several key insights into the code evaluation: Non-functional instructio"

Lumina-DiMOO sets itself apart from prior unified models by utilizing fully discrete diffusion modeling to handle inputs and outputs across various modalities. This innovative approach allows Lumina-DiMOO to achieve higher sampling efficiency compared to previous autoregressive (AR) or hybrid AR-Diffusion paradigms and adeptly support broad spectrum of multi-modal tasks, including text-to-image generation, image-to-image generation (e.g., image editing, subject-driven generation, and image inpainting, etc.), as well as image understanding. Lumina-DiMOO achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing existing open-source unified multi-modal models. To foster further advancements in multi-modal and discrete diffusion model research, we release our code and checkpoints to the community. 5 2 0 2 7 ] .

OBS-Diff is a novel one-shot pruning framework that compresses large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with minimal quality loss and significant inference acceleration.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA heads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme, assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error accumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration process. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with minimal degradation in visual quality.

"OBS-Diff is a novel one-shot pruning framework that compresses large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with minimal quality loss and significant inference acceleration.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA heads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme, assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error accumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration process. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with minimal degradation in visual quality."

WristWorld is a 4D world model that generates wrist-view videos from anchor views, improving video generation consistency and VLA performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture fine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation performance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views. Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first 4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views. WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation, which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid, Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the anchor-wrist view gap.

TTRV enhances vision language understanding through test-time reinforcement learning, improving performance on object recognition and VQA without labeled data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work, we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data. Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%, respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16 datasets.Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up to 5.5% in recognition tasks.

AI-generated summary 				 We present AlphaApollo, a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that aims to address two bottlenecks in foundation model (FM) reasoning-limited model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration. AlphaApollo orchestrates multiple models with professional tools to enable deliberate, verifiable reasoning. It couples (i) a computation tool (Python with numerical and symbolic libraries) and (ii) a retrieval tool (task-relevant external information) to execute exact calculations and ground decisions. The system further supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state map that records candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative refinement. In evaluations on AIME 2024/2025 across multiple models, AlphaApollo delivers consistent gains: +5.15% Average@32 and +23.34% Pass@32 for Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and +8.91% Average@32 with +26.67% Pass@32 for Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. Tool-use analysis shows that more than 80% of tool calls are successfully executed, with consistent outperformance of non-tool baselines, thereby lifting the capability ceiling of FMs. More empirical results and implementation details will be updated at https://github.com/tmlr-group/AlphaApollo.

MLE-Smith automates the creation of high-quality, diverse MLE tasks from raw datasets using a multi-agent pipeline, improving scalability and maintaining task quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 While Language Models (LMs) have made significant progress in automating machine learning engineering (MLE), the acquisition of high-quality MLE training data is significantly constrained. Current MLE benchmarks suffer from low scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually curated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We introduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw datasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient generate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality, real-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in MLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled with a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and high-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and real-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of real-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories, objectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively across a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasks shows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs on MLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefully human-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith to scaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality.

Research investigates the aging of factuality benchmarks and its impact on evaluating the factuality of large language models, revealing significant unreliability due to outdated samples.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) and the real world has outpaced the static nature of widely used evaluation benchmarks, raising concerns about their reliability for evaluating LLM factuality. While substantial works continue to rely on the popular but old benchmarks, their temporal misalignment with real-world facts and modern LLMs, and their effects on LLM factuality evaluation remain underexplored. Therefore, in this work, we present a systematic investigation of this issue by examining five popular factuality benchmarks and eight LLMs released across different years. An up-to-date fact retrieval pipeline and three metrics are tailored to quantify benchmark aging and its impact on LLM factuality evaluation. Experimental results and analysis illustrate that a considerable portion of samples in the widely used factuality benchmarks are outdated, leading to unreliable assessments of LLM factuality. We hope our work can provide a testbed to assess the reliability of a benchmark for LLM factuality evaluation and inspire more research on the benchmark aging issue.
