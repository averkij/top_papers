Text:"Preprint. CALM < BEFORE THE STORM : UNLOCKING NATIVE REASONING FOR OPTIMIZATION MODELING Zhengyang Tang1,5, Zihan Ye1, Chenyu Huang2, Xuhan Huang1, Chengpeng Li5, Sihang Li5, Guanhua Chen3, Ming Yan1, Zizhuo Wang1, Hongyuan Zha1, Dayiheng Liu5, and Benyou Wang1,4 1The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen 2Shanghai University of Finance and Economics 3Southern University of Science and Technology 4Shenzhen Loop Area Institute (SLAI) 5Qwen Team, Alibaba Inc. ABSTRACT Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex multi-step reasoning, opening new opportunities for automating optimization modeling. However, existing domain adaptation methods, originally designed for earlier instruction-tuned models, often fail to exploit the advanced reasoning patterns of modern LRMs In particular, we show that direct fine-tuning on traditional non-reflective datasets leads to limited gains. To fully leverage LRMs inherent reasoning abilities, we propose CALM (Corrective Adaptation with Lightweight Modification), framework that progressively refines LRMs within their native reasoning modes for optimization modeling tasks. In CALM, an expert intervener identifies reasoning flaws and provides concise corrective hints, which the LRM incorporates to produce improved reasoning trajectories. These interventions modify fewer than 2.6% of generated tokens, but generate high-quality data for soft adaptation through supervised fine-tuning. The adapted model is then further improved through reinforcement learning. Building on CALM, we develop STORM (Smart Thinking Optimization Reasoning Model), 4B-parameter LRM that achieves new state-of-the-art average accuracy of 68.9% across five popular optimization modeling benchmarks, matching the performance of 671B LRM. These results demonstrate that dynamic, hint-based data synthesis both preserves and amplifies the native reasoning patterns of modern LRMs, offering more effective and scalable path towards expert-leve"

CALM framework uses expert interventions to refine LRM reasoning for optimization tasks, achieving high accuracy with fewer modifications compared to traditional methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex multi-step reasoning, opening new opportunities for automating optimization modeling. However, existing domain adaptation methods, originally designed for earlier instruction-tuned models, often fail to exploit the advanced reasoning patterns of modern LRMs -- In particular, we show that direct fine-tuning on traditional non-reflective datasets leads to limited gains. To fully leverage LRMs' inherent reasoning abilities, we propose CALM (Corrective Adaptation with Lightweight Modification), a framework that progressively refines LRMs within their native reasoning modes for optimization modeling tasks. In CALM, an expert intervener identifies reasoning flaws and provides concise corrective hints, which the LRM incorporates to produce improved reasoning trajectories. These interventions modify fewer than 2.6\% of generated tokens, but generate high-quality data for soft adaptation through supervised fine-tuning. The adapted model is then further improved through reinforcement learning. Building on CALM, we develop STORM (Smart Thinking Optimization Reasoning Model), a 4B-parameter LRM that achieves a new state-of-the-art average accuracy of 68.9\% across five popular optimization modeling benchmarks, matching the performance of a 671B LRM. These results demonstrate that dynamic, hint-based data synthesis both preserves and amplifies the native reasoning patterns of modern LRMs, offering a more effective and scalable path towards expert-level performance on challenging optimization modeling tasks.

A language-mixed chain-of-thought reasoning approach improves performance in Korean-specific tasks by switching between English and Korean, achieving state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent frontier models employ long chain-of-thought reasoning to explore solution spaces in context and achieve stonger performance. While many works study distillation to build smaller yet capable models, most focus on English and little is known about language-specific reasoning. To bridge this gap, we first introduct **Language-Mixed CoT**, a reasoning schema that switches between English and a target language, using English as an anchor to excel in reasoning while minimizing translation artificats. As a Korean case study, we curate **Yi-Sang**: 5.79M native-Korean prompts from web Q&A, exams, STEM, and code; 3.7M long reasoning traces generated from Qwen3-32B; and a targeted 260k high-yield subset. We train ninve models (4B-35B) across six families (Qwen2.5, Llama-3.1, Gemma-3, etc). Our best model, **KO-REAson-35B**, achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the highest overall average score (64.0 \pm 25), ranking first on 5/9 benchmarks and second on the remainder. Samller and mid-sized models also benefit substantially, with an average improvement of +18.6 points across teh evaluated nine benchmarks. Ablations show **Language-Mixed CoT** is more effective than monolingual CoT, also resulting in cross-lingual and mult-modal performance gains. We release our data-curation pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and models to advance research on language-specific reasoning. Data and model collection: https://huggingface.co/KOREAson.
