Our experiments show that LEGOGPT produces stable, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing LEGO designs that align closely with the input text prompts. We also develop text-based LEGO texturing method to generate colored and textured designs. We show that our designs can be assembled manually by humans and automatically by robotic arms. We also release our new dataset, StableText2Lego, containing over 47,000 LEGO structures of over 28,000 unique 3D objects accompanied by detailed captions, along with our code and models at the project website: https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/. 1. Introduction 3D generative models have made remarkable progress, driven by advances in generative modeling [15, 65] and neural rendering [26, 52]. These models have enabled various applications in virtual reality, gaming, entertainment, and scientific computing. For example, several works have explored synthesizing 3D objects from text [58], adding texture to meshes [9, 61], and manipulating the shape and appearance of existing 3D objects and scenes [19, 40]. However, applying existing methods to create real-world objects remains challenging. Most approaches focus on generating diverse 3D objects with high-fidelity geometry and appearance [21, 85], but these digital designs often cannot be physically realized due to two key challenges [46]. First, the objects may be difficult to assemble or fabricate using standard components. Second, the resulting structure may be physically unstable even if assembly is possible. Without proper support, parts of the design can collapse, float, or remain disconnected. In this work, we address the challenge of generating physically realizable objects and study this problem in the context of LEGO design. LEGO is widely used in entertainment, education, artistic creation, and manufacturing prototyping. Additionally, it can serve as reproducible research benchmark, as all standard components are readily available. Due to the significant effort required for manual design, recent studies have developed automated algorithms to streamline the process and generate compelling results. However, existing approaches primarily create LEGO designs from given 3D object [45] or focus on single object category [12, 13]. Our goal is to develop method for generating LEGO designs directly from freeform text prompts while ensuring physical stability and buildability. Specifically, we aim to train generative model that produces designs that are: Physically stable: Built on LEGO baseplate with strong structural integrity, without floating or collapsing bricks. Buildable: Compatible with standard LEGO pieces and able to be assembled brick-by-brick by humans or robots. In this work, we introduce LEGOGPT with the key insight of repurposing autoregressive large language models, originally trained for next-token prediction, for next-brick prediction. We formulate the problem of LEGO design as an autoregressive text generation task, where the next-brick dimension and placement are specified with simple textual format. To ensure generated structures are both stable and buildable, we enforce physics-aware assembly constraints during both training and inference. During training, we construct large-scale dataset of physically stable LEGO designs paired with captions. During autoregressive inference, we enforce feasibility with an efficient validity check and physics-aware rollback to ensure that the final tokens adhere to physics laws and assembly constraints. Our experiments show that the generated designs are stable, diverse, and visually appealing while adhering to input text prompts. Our method outperforms pre-trained LLMs with and without in-context learning, and previous approaches based on mesh-based 3D generation. Finally, we explore applications such as text-driven LEGO texturing, as well as manual assembly and automated robotic assembly of our designs. Our dataset, code, and models are available at the project website: https://avalovelace1. github.io/LegoGPT/. 2. Related Work Text-to-3D Generation. Text-to-3D generation has seen remarkable progress in recent years, driven by advances in neural rendering and generative models. Dreamfusion [58] and Score Jacobian Chaining [76] pioneer zero-shot textto-3D generation by optimizing neural radiance fields [52] with pre-trained diffusion models [62]. Subsequent work has explored alternative 3D representations [3, 33, 35, 42, 48, 51, 66] and improved loss functions [25, 44, 47, 74, 77, 83]. Rather than relying on iterative optimization, promising alternative direction trains generative models directly on 3D asset datasets, with various backbones including diffusion models [20, 32, 34, 54, 60, 63, 85, 86, 89], large reconstruction models [21, 31, 73, 81], U-Nets [36, 68], and autoregressive models [46, 18, 55, 64, 67, 79]. However, these existing methods cannot be directly applied to LEGO generation because they do not account for the unique physical constraints and assembly requirements of real-world object designs [46]. Our work bridges this gap by introducing framework for generating physically stable and b"

We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments.

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments."

We introduce LegoGPT, the first approach for generating physically stable LEGO brick models from text prompts. To achieve this, we construct a large-scale, physically stable dataset of LEGO designs, along with their associated captions, and train an autoregressive large language model to predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction. To improve the stability of the resulting designs, we employ an efficient validity check and physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, which prunes infeasible token predictions using physics laws and assembly constraints. Our experiments show that LegoGPT produces stable, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing LEGO designs that align closely with the input text prompts. We also develop a text-based LEGO texturing method to generate colored and textured designs. We show that our designs can be assembled manually by humans and automatically by robotic arms. We also release our new dataset, StableText2Lego, containing over 47,000 LEGO structures of over 28,000 unique 3D objects accompanied by detailed captions, along with our code and models at the project website: https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/.

Reasoning capabilities of large language models are primarily studied for English, even when pretrained models are multilingual. In this work, we investigate to what extent English reasoning finetuning with long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) can generalize across languages. First, we find that scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models (RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English. Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts.
