Text:"SIMPLEMIX: Frustratingly Simple Mixing of Offand On-policy Data in Language Model Preference Learning Tianjian Li 1 Daniel Khashabi 1 5 2 0 2 5 ] . [ 1 3 6 3 2 0 . 5 0 5 2 : r aAligning language models with human preferences relies on pairwise preference datasets. While some studies suggest that on-policy data consistently outperforms off -policy data for preference learning, others indicate that the advantages of on-policy data may be task-dependent, highlighting the need for systematic exploration of their interplay. In this work, we show that on-policy and offpolicy data offer complementary strengths in preference optimization: on-policy data is particularly effective for reasoning tasks like math and coding, while off-policy data performs better on open-ended tasks such as creative writing and making personal recommendations. Guided by these findings, we introduce SIMPLEMIX, an approach to combine the complementary strengths of on-policy and off-policy preference learning by simply mixing these two data sources. Our empirical results across diverse tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that SIMPLEMIX substantially improves language model alignment. Specifically, SIMPLEMIX improves upon on-policy DPO and off-policy DPO by an average of 6.03% on Alpaca Eval 2.0. Moreover, it outperforms prior approaches that are much more complex in combining onand off-policy data, such as HyPO and DPO-Mix-P, by an average of 3.05%. 1. Introduction Alignment of Language Models (LMs) has bestowed them with the ability to learn better from demonstrations (Brown et al., 2020), extrapolate from reasoning chains (Wei et al., *Equal contribution 1Center for Language and Speech Processing, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, US. Correspondence to: Tianjian Li <tli104@jhu.edu>. Proceedings of the 41 st International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada. PMLR 267, 2025. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 2022), and produce responses aligned with human values (Ouyang et al., 2022). The ongoing debate (Ivison et al., 2024; Tajwar et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024c) in the literature that compares alignment with on-policy data (data is sampled from the LM to be aligned) with off-policy data (data is sampled not from the LM to be aligned). The debate arrives at mismatched conclusions, with some works reporting onpolicy outperforms off-policy (Tajwar et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024c) while others reporting that the gains from on-policy training are minimal, and sometimes even underperform offpolicy training (Ivison et al., 2024; Ahmadian et al., 2024; Lambert et al., 2024a). Existing work (Ivison et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024c) that compares onand off-policy data does not control using the same algorithm under different data sources, and does not investigate the impact of task types (Tang et al., 2024). To address these weaknesses, we vary only the data source and break down the performances by different task types to answer the following research questions: (Q1) Under what circumstances onvs off-policy data offer different strengths? (Q2) Can we leverage their complementarity for more efficient alignment? With regards to (Q1), we observe that on-policy data and off-policy data offer complementary strengths in preference learning of LMs: On-policy data is most effective in tasks that tend to have objective answers and require reasoning skills, e.g., math and coding. Off-policy data is effective in more open-ended tasks, e.g., creative writing and making personal recommendations, where it is common to have multiple differing preferred responses (3). To address (Q2), we propose SIMPLEMIX: to mix onand off-policy data for preference learning. Our approach consistently improves upon only using onor off-policy data solely in data-constrained setups where the same amount of responses is used for each method. Furthermore, we show that SIMPLEMIX is able to outperform prior approaches that mix onand off-policy data in more complex ways (Song et al., 2024b; Shi et al., 2024), showcasing the effectiveness SIMPLEMIX: Frustratingly Simple Offand On-policy Data Mixing in Language Model Preference Learning Figure 1. Left panel: Our work studies data origin in preference optimization of LMs. Middle panel: We show that on-policy data and off-policy data are complementary: on-policy data mostly improves the models performance on reasoning tasks that are objectively correct or incorrect (e.g., Math and Coding) while off-policy data improves on sub-tasks where humans might disagree with each other (e.g., creative writing and personal recommendation) (3). Right panel: Our proposed method SIMPLEMIX mixes on and off-policy data, outperforming solely using either on or off-policy data. (4) of our method despite its simplicity (4). Figure 1 illustrates our work: The complementary nature of onand off-policy data in LM preference learning: on-policy DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024) outperforms off-policy DPO in reasoning tasks, e.g., solving math problem, while underperforms in open-ended tasks, e.g., describing an imaginary city(3); SIMPLEMIX: Mixing onand off-policy data in DPO can outperform DPO with single data source (4). SIMPLEMIX achieves an average improvement of 6.03 over on-policy and off-policy methods on Alpaca Eval 2.0 and outperforms existing hybrid approaches by 3.05 while maintaining simplicity. To sum up, our contribution is two-fold: (1) We show that onand off-policy data in preference learning are complementary: on-policy data excels at tasks requiring reasoning and objective verification, such as math and coding, whereas off-policy data is more effective for open-ended tasks, such as creative writing and personal recommendations. (2) We demonstrate that good balance between onand off-policy data consistently outperforms approaches relying solely on either data source. 2. Preliminaries and Notations We consider post-training of LMs. Given user prompt in natural language, the language model π(x) takes the prompt as input and outputs probability distribution over natural language responses y. The Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage of LM updates pre-trained LM πbase on dataset with (prompt, response) pairs: DSFT = {(x1, y1), . . . , (xN , yN )} with the following maximum likelihood objective: πSFT arg maxπ i=1 π(yi xi). (cid:81)N Preference Optimization (PO) While SFT is step forward in aligning LMs to follow human instructions, the resulting model is not aligned to human preferences. For example, hu"

Aligning language models with human preferences relies on pairwise preference datasets. While some studies suggest that on-policy data consistently outperforms off -policy data for preference learning, others indicate that the advantages of on-policy data may be task-dependent, highlighting the need for a systematic exploration of their interplay.   In this work, we show that on-policy and off-policy data offer complementary strengths in preference optimization: on-policy data is particularly effective for reasoning tasks like math and coding, while off-policy data performs better on open-ended tasks such as creative writing and making personal recommendations. Guided by these findings, we introduce SIMPLEMIX, an approach to combine the complementary strengths of on-policy and off-policy preference learning by simply mixing these two data sources. Our empirical results across diverse tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that SIMPLEMIX substantially improves language model alignment. Specifically, SIMPLEMIX improves upon on-policy DPO and off-policy DPO by an average of 6.03% on Alpaca Eval 2.0. Moreover, it outperforms prior approaches that are much more complex in combining on- and off-policy data, such as HyPO and DPO-Mix-P, by an average of 3.05%.
