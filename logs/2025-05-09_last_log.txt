In practical applications, there are some scenes with extreme conditions, such as significant variation of illumination, and the presence of textureless or repetitive patterns. In these extreme conditions, achieving reliable feature matching still remains challenging task. Traditional local feature matching methods typically involve three stages: keypoint detection, descriptor extraction, and feature matching. Early methods such as SIFT [12] and SURF [13] propose well-designed handcrafted descriptors. During the feature matching stage, nearest neighbor matching is commonly employed to obtain the matching results. In recent years, deep learning-based feature matching methods have significantly improved the performance of traditional algorithms [14], [15]. Some studies have jointly trained keypoint prediction and descriptor extraction [16], [17], [18], which not only increases processing speed but also further optimizes matching performance. Additionally, other studies have introduced graph neural networks [19], [20], framing the feature matching task as an optimal transport problem, thereby effectively improving matching accuracy. 1School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; 2SF Technology, Shenzhen, China; 3School of Computer Science, Central China Normal University and the Hubei Engineering Research Center for Intelligent Detection and Identification of Complex Parts, Wuhan, China; 4Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore. (: Equal contribution.) (Corresponding author: Yongchao Xu, yongchao.xu@whu.edu.cn) Fig. 1: Feature matching of applying 2D visual cues and integrating 3D geometric cues in low texture scene. Green lines: correct matches; Red lines: incorrect matches. Histograms: distribution of descriptor features. (a) Result of using SuperPoint [14]. (b) 3D geometric Normal Map. (c) Result of using our LiftFeat. Incorporating 3D information enhances the distinctiveness of the raw 2D descriptors. Despite the advanced performance of current methods in most scenarios, 2D visual cues can cause confusion in feature matching for scenes with extreme conditions, including significant illumination variation, low texture, or repetitive patterns. As shown in Fig. 1, in textureless scenes, raw 2D descriptors may lead to incorrect matches due to insufficient discriminative visual information. An intuitive idea is to leverage the additional information from 3D data to enhance the robustness of feature matching. However, the precision and cost of using 3D data introduce new challenges, particularly in scenarios like robotics, where computational power is limited. In this paper, we focus on designing lightweight model that integrates 2D and 3D cues for local feature matching. Depth maps is one of the most accessible 3D cue. Yet, depth maps exhibit scale ambiguity, making them unsuitable for direct use in local feature matching. In contrast, surface normal possesses both translation and scale invariance, which is suitable for feature matching. Therefore, we incorporate surface normal estimation head into the network to learn 3D geometric knowledge. Notably, the pseudo surface normal labels are derived from depth maps predicted by Depth Anything v2 [21], which eliminates the need for additional annotation costs during training. Subsequently, we propose 3D Geometry-aware Feature Lifting (3D-GFL) module to fuse the raw 2D description with the 3D normal feature, lifting the discriminative ability of raw 2D descriptors in challenging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method termed LiftFeat achieves state-of-theart performance across multiple tasks: relative pose estimation, homography estimation, and visual localization. The main contributions of this work are as follows: 1) We propose lightweight network named LiftFeat, which innovatively introduces 3D geometry for local feature matching. 2) We design 3D Geometry-aware Feature Lifting (3DGFL) module that fuses 2D description with 3D normal feature, significantly improving the discriminative ability of raw 2D descriptors in challenging scenarios. 3) Experiments on different tasks confirm that our method achieves high accuracy and robustness across various scenarios. Additional runtime tests confirm that our method can achieve inference latency of 7.4 ms on edge devices. II. RELATED WORK A. Local Feature Matching Local feature matching is fundamental module in downstream applications such as visual localization [11], [22], simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) [6], [23]. It typically involves three key steps: feature detection, feature description, and feature matching. Traditional algorithms like SIFT [12] and ORB [24] focus on designing features that are invariant to scale, rotation, and illumination changes. Due to their ease of deployment, these methods are still wid"

Robust and efficient local feature matching plays a crucial role in applications such as SLAM and visual localization for robotics. Despite great progress, it is still very challenging to extract robust and discriminative visual features in scenarios with drastic lighting changes, low texture areas, or repetitive patterns. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight network called LiftFeat, which lifts the robustness of raw descriptor by aggregating 3D geometric feature. Specifically, we first adopt a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model to generate pseudo surface normal label, supervising the extraction of 3D geometric feature in terms of predicted surface normal. We then design a 3D geometry-aware feature lifting module to fuse surface normal feature with raw 2D descriptor feature. Integrating such 3D geometric feature enhances the discriminative ability of 2D feature description in extreme conditions. Extensive experimental results on relative pose estimation, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks, demonstrate that our LiftFeat outperforms some lightweight state-of-the-art methods. Code will be released at : https://github.com/lyp-deeplearning/LiftFeat.
