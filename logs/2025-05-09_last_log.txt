Introduction The integration of vision and language (Alayrac et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023; Gabeff et al., 2024) has been long-standing goal in artificial intelligence, aiming *Equal contribution 1360 AI Research.

Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 to develop models that can understand and reason about the world in visually and linguistically rich manner. Recent advances in multimodal pre-training, such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), have made significant strides in this direction by learning joint representations of images and text through contrastive learning. These models have achieved stateof-the-art performance in variety of downstream tasks, including image-text retrieval (Pan et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024), image captioning (Mokady et al., 2021; Li et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2024), and visual question answering (Li et al., 2023a; Parelli et al., 2023; Team et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025). However, despite their impressive capabilities, these models often struggle with fine-grained details, particularly in recognizing object attributes and their relationships. Recent works (Liu et al., 2023a; Wu et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Jing et al., 2024) point out two primary reasons for the limitations in CLIPs finegrained learning capability. First, the original CLIP models text encoder supports only up to 77 tokens, restricting its capacity to process detailed descriptions and hindering its ability to capture nuanced textual information. Second, CLIP aligns entire images with corresponding text descriptions, making it challenging to extract valuable region-specific representations from visual features. Consequently, the model struggles to achieve fine-grained alignment between image regions and their corresponding textual attributes, limiting its effectiveness in complex recognition scenarios. To address these issues, researchers have proposed extending the positional encoding to support longer token sequences (Wu et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024) and integrating object detection datasets into CLIP training (Zhong et al., 2022; Jing et al., 2024). By aligning bounding boxes with category labels, these methods aim to enhance regional feature extraction. Although these approaches have shown some improvements, they still fall short in fine-grained visual recognition and open-vocabulary object detection. Existing methods (Jing et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024) typically introduce relatively few long captions, usually on million scale, which is inadequate for effective learning of fine-grained details. Additionally, aligning image regions with category labels limits semantic diversity, restricting the models generalization to open-world scenarFG-CLIP: Fine-Grained Visual and Textual Alignment ios. Furthermore, the lack of hard fine-grained negative samples limits the models ability to distinguish between objects of the same category but with different attributes. In this work, we introduce Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), novel approach designed to enhance CLIPs fine-grained understanding capabilities through three key innovations. First, we significantly enhance global-level semantic alignment by generating long captions using state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) (Hong et al., 2024). This process introduces 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs, providing an unprecedented scale of data that allows FG-CLIP to capture nuanced details at the global-level semantic layer, thereby enhancing its ability to perceive complex and detailed information. Second, to improve fine-grained alignment between images and text, we develop high-quality visual grounding dataset. This dataset includes detailed descriptions for 40 million bounding boxes across 12 million images, ensuring that each region is precisely annotated with context-rich captions. By creating such an extensive and richly annotated dataset, we enable the model to learn precise and contextually rich representations, significantly enhancing its performance on tasks that require fine-grained understanding. Third, to further enhance model robustness and discrimination abilities, we introduce large-scale corpus of 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples. By incorporating these challenging negative samples into the training process, FGCLIP learns to distinguish subtle differences in semantically similar but distinct pairs, thereby significantly improving its performance across various downstream tasks. Compared to previous methods, FG-CLIP demonstrates significant improvements across wide range of benchmark tasks. Our comprehensive enhancements enable the model to achieve superior performance in capturing nuanced "

Second, a high-quality dataset is constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic differences. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks, including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection, image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks. These results highlight FG-CLIP's effectiveness in capturing fine-grained image details and improving overall model performance. The related data, code, and models are available at https://github.com/360CVGroup/FG-CLIP."

We introduce the novel task of Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D Scenes. Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding, this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.
