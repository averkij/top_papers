However, existing utility-centric unlearning metrics (based on model utility) may fail to accurately evaluate the extent of unlearning in realistic settings such as when (a) the forget and retain set have semantically similar content, (b) retraining the model from scratch on the retain set is impractical, and/or (c) the model owner can improve the unlearning metric without directly performing unlearning on the LLM. This paper presents the first data-centric unlearning metric for LLMs called WaterDrum that exploits robust text watermarking for overcoming these limitations. We also introduce new benchmark datasets for LLM unlearning that contain varying levels of similar data points and can be used to rigorously evaluate unlearning algorithms using WaterDrum. Our code is available at GitHub and our new benchmark datasets are released at HuggingFace. 1. Introduction The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have drastically improved in recent years, prompting increased efforts to deploy LLMs in real-world applications. However, accompanying this push for practical LLM deployment are growing concerns around data issues regarding LLMs that may threaten to derail such developments, especially since LLMs typically require large amounts of training *Equal contribution 1Department of of Singapore, 2Centre for Singapore Science, National University 117417 A*STAR, Way, Create <{xinyang.lu,rachael.sim,wenfanyu}@u.nus.edu, {niux,greglau,btcnhung,lowkh}@comp.nus.edu.sg, seekiong@nus.edu.sg, foo chuan sheng@i2r.a-star.edu.sg>.

Data owners have raised intellectual property (IP) infringement concerns: For example, the New York Times has sued OpenAI over its LLMs use of their copyrighted work (Grynbaum and Mac, 2023). Many jurisdictions are also paying increased scrutiny over data privacy concerns, e.g., with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, 2016) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA, 2018) mandating the right to be forgotten that allow users to request the erasure of their data from the trained models. Furthermore, it is also not uncommon for public data to become outdated or to be found erroneous/harmful, e.g., the retraction of public scientific papers with fabricated data (Hu et al., 2024). These data concerns have sparked considerable research efforts on LLM unlearning algorithms, which aim to efficiently remove the influence of subset of the models original training data (called the forget set) while avoiding the prohibitively expensive alternative of retraining the model from scratch on the retain set. However, due to the size and complexity of LLMs, existing unlearning algorithms cannot yet achieve complete unlearning: They may not be able to fully remove the influence of all data in the forget set, and may also inadvertently remove the influence of data in the retain set that should be preserved (Maini et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024b). This brings up natural question: How can we measure the extent to which these algorithms have unlearned given set of data? Existing works have largely proposed utility-centric unlearning metrics that evaluate unlearning based on model utility (performance) indicators, such as the perplexity or accuracy on downstream tasks. After unlearning, the model utility indicators related to the forget set are expected to worsen. We provide an overview of unlearning metrics and position our work in App. A. However, are these utility-centric metrics effective in the face of practical challenges with real-world datasets? In real-life settings, it is (a) common for the forget and retain set to have semantically similar content, (b) typical to be prohibitively expensive to retrain an LLM, and (c) possible that an LLM owner might attempt to improve the metric without directly performing LLM unlearning to reduce cost. In Sec. 5, we will show that utility-centric metrics fall short and we have identified three reasons. First, expecting worse WaterDrum: Watermarking for Data-centric Unlearning Metric utility on the forget set after unlearning ignores the ability of the LLMs to generalize from the retain set (Liu et al., 2024a). Second, these metrics require the retrained LLM to obtain reference values to evaluate the success of unlearning, which is not obtainable in practice. Finally, these metrics are also not resilient as model owner can improve them without directly performing unlearning on the LLM with the threat model in Sec. 2.3. modify the original model φT based on DF to generate an unlearned model φR that approximates φR. Such an unlearned model may not have fully unlearned the forget set and could be intuitively viewed as retaining the influence of some subset of the forget set data DG DF and hence still be effectively influenced by its approximate retain set DR = DR DG. The best unlearned models should have the size DG be as small as possible. In this work, we first take into consideration the above limitations to (a) define clear desiderata that an effective, practical, and resilient unlearning metric should satisfy (Sec. 2). Next, we (b) propose novel data-centric approach to evaluating LLM unlearning instead. Specifically, we develop Watermarking for Data-centric Unlearning Metric (WaterDrum) that satisfies these desiderata, based on robust text watermarking framework Waterfall (Lau et al., 2024) that is capable of verifying multiple data owners watermarks in LLM outputs when the LLM is trained on their watermarked text data (Sec. 3). Our key insight is that using watermarked data creates clear counterfactual model that is not trained on watermarked data would not contain the watermark signal. As existing benchmark datasets are insufficient to verify our desiderata, we (c) propose new empirical evaluation methods and an accompanying new benchmark dataset WaterDrum-Ax that includes data from multiple parties and contains duplicates with varying degree"

However, the inner mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically st...

Large language model (LLM) unlearning is critical in real-world applications where it is necessary to efficiently remove the influence of private, copyrighted, or harmful data from some users. However, existing utility-centric unlearning metrics (based on model utility) may fail to accurately evaluate the extent of unlearning in realistic settings such as when (a) the forget and retain set have semantically similar content, (b) retraining the model from scratch on the retain set is impractical, and/or (c) the model owner can improve the unlearning metric without directly performing unlearning on the LLM. This paper presents the first data-centric unlearning metric for LLMs called WaterDrum that exploits robust text watermarking for overcoming these limitations. We also introduce new benchmark datasets for LLM unlearning that contain varying levels of similar data points and can be used to rigorously evaluate unlearning algorithms using WaterDrum. Our code is available at https://github.com/lululu008/WaterDrum and our new benchmark datasets are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Glow-AI/WaterDrum-Ax.
