Text:"5 2 0 2 8 ] . [ 1 5 1 3 5 0 . 5 0 5 2 : r aYuhui Xu Hanze Dong Lei Wang Doyen Sahoo Junnan Li Caiming XiongLarge reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, novel framework for scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two phasesthinking and solutionwith independently allocated budgets. At test time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments, significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce lightweight budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming (LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in unconstrained settings. The code will be made publicly available after completing the necessary review process.Large reasoning models (LRMs) [4, 25] have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by producing extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) outputs, which facilitate effective problem-solving in domains such as mathematics and programming. Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques [29, 43, 27, 5, 30], have been employed to optimize these reasoning trajectories, enabling LRMs to generate longer, more informative chains. These RL-driven methods scale effectively across diverse benchmarks [44, 6, 21, 39, 20], yielding substantial gains in both solution accuracy and robustness; while they often incur significantly longer inference chains [4, 7, 41, 26, 38]. Notably, the length of the reasoning trajectory remains uncontrolled, making it difficult to allocate fixed compute budget at inference time while maintaining desired performance level. Two primary lines of research have been proposed to address this challenge. The first, known as Long2Short [34, 14], seeks to reduce reasoning length through reinforcement learning with trajectory penalties or compression-aware fine-tuning, where the model is trained on shortened trajectories to preserve performance while minimizing inference cost. The second line of work focuses on length control [24, 1, 42]. S1 [24] introduces simple mechanism that prompts the model to emit special tokens (e.g., Wait, Final Answer) to regulate reasoning length. However, this approach significantly degrades performance, as it overlooks the critical role of the solution segment. L1 [1] proposes reinforcement learning framework that enforces explicit length constraints over the entire trajectory. While more flexible, this method demands substantial training resources and still results in noticeable performance degradation compared to the original model. Preprint. We propose Elastic Reasoning, simple yet effective method that enables large reasoning models to achieve scalable and adaptive length control. As illustrated in Figure 1, the S1 approachgenerating the answer by emitting special token such as Final Answerperforms better than directly truncating the full reasoning trajectory, underscoring the importance of preserving the solution segment. Motivated by this, we propose separate budgeting which explicitly divides the total token budget into two parts: tokens for the thinking phase and tokens for the solution phase, where = + s. Once the model consumes tokens in the thinking phase, we forcibly terminate it by appending the special token </think> and transition to solution generation. Separate budgeting outperforms S1 under varying generation budgets. To further improve solution quality under incomplete reasoning, we introduce novel training strategy called budget-constrained rollout, which teaches the model to generate high-quality answers even with partial CoT trajectories. This method is integrated into GRPO training and is highly efficientrequiring only 200 training steps on math tasks with maximum response length of 2K tokens (t = 1K, = 1K), compared to 700 steps for L1-Exact and 820 steps for L1-Max with 4K response length. Moreover, models trained with Elastic Reasoning generalize effectively to arbitrary reasoning budgets without the need for further fine-tuning. Figure 1: Separating thinking and solution phases enables better length control. We evaluate Elastic Reasoning on both mathematical and programming reasoning tasks, introducing two models: E1-Math-1.5B and E1Code-14B. (1) E1-Math-1.5B outperforms both L1-Exact and S1, and achieves performance comparable to L1-Max, while requiring significantly fewer training steps. For instance, on the AIME2024 dataset, our method achieves 35.0% accuracy, compared to 27.1% for L1-Max, 24.2% for L1-Exact, and 41.0% for the original model. (2) E1-Code-14B demonstrates strong scaling with varying inference budgets, achieving Codeforces rating of 1987 and placing in the 96.0 percentilecomparable to O1-2024-12-17 (Low), which scores 1991 and ranks in the 96.1 percentile. (3) surprising observation is that, after training, the trajectories generated by our models are significantly shorter than those from the original DeepScaleR and DeepCoder models across both math and code tasks. This suggests that budget-constrained rollout not only improves length control but also encourages the model to reason more concisely and generate more efficient solutions.2.1 Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models Increasing computation during inference, often referred to as test-time scaling (TTS), has been shown to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs [36, 35, 33, 4, 34, 24]. Early works, such as chain-of-thought prompting [36], show that producing series of intermediate reasoning steps significantly improves LLMs performance on complex reasoning tasks. Building on this, selfconsistency [35] further boosts performance by sampling diverse set of reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answer. Recent studies have "

As cornerstone of computer vision, it supports wide range of applications, from immersive filmmaking [1], [2] and expansive game worlds [3], [4], [5] to architectural visualization [6], [7]. It also plays crucial role in AR/VR [8], [9], [10], robotics simulation [11], [12], and autonomous driving [13], [14] by providing high-fidelity environments for training and testing. Beyond these applications, 3D scene generation is vital for advancing embodied AI [15], [16], [17] and world models [18], [19], [20], which depend on diverse, high-quality scenes for learning and evaluation. Realistic scene synthesis enhances AI agents ability to navigate, interact, and adapt, driving progress in autonomous systems and virtual simulations. As shown in Figure 1, 3D scene generation has gained significant attention in recent years. Early scene generation methods relied on procedural generation using rule-based algorithms [21] and manually designed assets [22], offering scalability and control in game design [23], urban planning [24], [25], and architecture [26], [27]. However, their reliance on predefined rules and deterministic algorithms limits diversity, requiring extensive human intervention for realistic or varied scenes [28].

Combined with innovations in 3D representations like NeRF [31] and 3D Gaussians [32], neural 3D-based generation methods enhance geometry fidelity, rendering efficiency, and view consistency, making them ideal for photorealistic scene synthesis and immersive virtual environments. Starting from single image, image-based scene generation methods leverage camera pose transformations and image outpainting to iteratively synthesize perpetual views [33], [34] or panoramic local environments [35], [36]. Benefit from the rapid advancement of video diffusion models [37], [38], video generation quality has significantly improved, leading to surge in 3D scene generation research over the past two years. These methods formulate 3D scene generation as form of video generation and enhance view consistency through temporal modeling [39].

"Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments, significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional training.

3D scene generation seeks to synthesize spatially structured, semantically meaningful, and photorealistic environments for applications such as immersive media, robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied AI. Early methods based on procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations, trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets, evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations, and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity, physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D vision, and embodied intelligence.

Recent proprietary models (e.g., o3) have begun to demonstrate strong multimodal reasoning capabilities. Yet, most existing open-source research concentrates on training text-only reasoning models, with evaluations limited to mainly mathematical and general-domain tasks. Therefore, it remains unclear how to effectively extend reasoning capabilities beyond text input and general domains. This paper explores a fundamental research question: Is reasoning generalizable across modalities and domains? Our findings support an affirmative answer: General-domain text-based post-training can enable such strong generalizable reasoning. Leveraging this finding, we introduce X-Reasoner, a vision-language model post-trained solely on general-domain text for generalizable reasoning, using a two-stage approach: an initial supervised fine-tuning phase with distilled long chain-of-thoughts, followed by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Experiments show that X-Reasoner successfully transfers reasoning capabilities to both multimodal and out-of-domain settings, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models trained with in-domain and multimodal data across various general and medical benchmarks (Figure 1). Additionally, we find that X-Reasoner's performance in specialized domains can be further enhanced through continued training on domain-specific text-only data. Building upon this, we introduce X-Reasoner-Med, a medical-specialized variant that achieves new state of the art on numerous text-only and multimodal medical benchmarks.
