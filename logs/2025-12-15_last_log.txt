[ 1 4 6 4 1 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r Exploring MLLM-Diffusion Information Transfer with MetaCanvas Han Lin1,2,, Xichen Pan1,3, Ziqi Huang1,4,, Ji Hou1, Jialiang Wang1, Weifeng Chen1,, Zecheng He1,, Felix Juefei-Xu1, Junzhe Sun1, Zhipeng Fan1, Ali Thabet1, Mohit Bansal2, Chu Wang1 1Meta Superintelligence Labs, 2UNC Chapel Hill, 3New York University, 4Nanyang Technological University Work done at Meta Multimodal learning has rapidly advanced visual understanding, largely via multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that use powerful LLMs as cognitive cores. In visual generation, however, these powerful core models are typically reduced to global text encoders for diffusion models, leaving most of their reasoning and planning ability unused. This creates gap: current multimodal LLMs can parse complex layouts, attributes, and knowledge-intensive scenes, yet struggle to generate images or videos with equally precise and structured control. We propose MetaCanvas, lightweight framework that lets MLLMs reason and plan directly in spatial and spatiotemporal latent spaces and interface tightly with diffusion generators. We empirically implement MetaCanvas on three different diffusion backbones and evaluate it across six tasks, including text-to-image generation, text/image-to-video generation, image/video editing, and in-context video generation, each requiring precise layouts, robust attribute binding, and reasoning-intensive control. MetaCanvas consistently outperforms global-conditioning baselines, suggesting that treating MLLMs as latent-space planners is promising direction for narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation.

Training employs multi-sample flow matching to reduce variance, while inference uses action compression and challenge-specific correction rules. Our approach achieves 26% q-score across all 50 tasks on both public and private leaderboards.1.2 Key Challenges 1.1 The BEHAVIOR Challenge The BEHAVIOR Challenge presents demanding benchmark for embodied AI: performing 50 diverse, long-horizon household tasks in photo-realistic simulation. Tasks range from simple (turning on radio) to complex multi-step activities (cooking hotdog). The challenge requires: Long-horizon execution: 6.6 minutes on average per task, with the longest tasks averaging 14 minutes Bimanual manipulation: Coordinated use of two 7-DOF arms with parallel-jaw grippers Mobile navigation: Indoor navigation through cluttered environments Multi-camera perception: Processing RGB images from head and both wrist cameras Task diversity: 50 different activities evaluated with single policy (or small set of checkpoints) The benchmark uses OmniGibson simulation built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, providing realistic physics and rendering. Each task is evaluated over 10 episodes with randomized initial conditions, and performance is measured by q-score that combines success rate with partial credit for subtask completion. Long-horizon household manipulation poses several fundamental challenges: Compounding errors. With episodes spanning thousands of timesteps, small prediction errors can accumulate. This demands either extremely accurate predictions or robust recovery behaviors. Non-Markovian states. Many task states are visually ambiguousthe robot holding radio at the start of task looks identical to holding it at the end. Without memory of past actions or explicit stage tracking, the policy cannot distinguish these states and may execute incorrect actions. No recovery demonstrations. The training data consists of successful demonstrations only. When the robot deviates from demonstrated trajectories (inevitable given compounding errors), it encounters states never seen during training. The policy must somehow generalize to recover from these out-of-distribution situations. Multi-modal action distributions. Many states admit multiple valid action sequences (e.g., which hand to use, which object to grasp first). Different episodes of the same tasks were completed at different speeds in the training data. 1.3 Our Approach We build upon Pi0.5 [3], vision-language-action (VLA) model that uses flow matching to predict action sequences. 1 Our modifications address the challenges above through the following novel components: Modeling action structure. Robot actions exhibit strong correlationstemporally (smooth trajectories) and across dimensions (coordinated joint movements). We model this structure explicitly by training with correlated noise sampled from (0, βΣ + (1 β)I), where Σ is the empirical action covariance and β = 0.5. This makes training more efficient and enables principled inpainting during inference. Providing non-Markovian context. We introduce System 2 stage tracking: the model predicts the current task stage, and voting mechanism filters noisy predictions to maintain stable stage estimates. This stage information is fused with task embeddings and fed back to the model, resolving ambiguous states. Combining learning with heuristics. Pure learning struggles with the lack of recovery data. We complement the learned policy with correction rules derived from failure analysis: simple heuristics that detect and recover from common failure modes like accidental gripper closures. We apply learnable mixed-layer attention that allows each action expert layer to attend to learned linear combinations of all VLM layers rather than arbitrarily deciding how action expert layers should attend to VLM layers. For training, we employ multi-sample flow matching (15 predictions per VLM forward pass) to reduce gradient variance while amortizing expensive vision-language computations. At inference, we apply action compression via cubic splines to speed up action execution by 1.3. We also simplified the VLM part by removing text processing and using trainable task embeddings instead of the text prompt. Technically this removes from VLA and VLM terms but we keep the names VLA and VLM for simplicity. 1.4 Note on Evidence This report describes competition entry, not research paper. As small independent team with limited compute, we prioritized winning over rigorous ablation studies. Many design choices were guided by intuition or quick experiments rather than systematic evaluation. We present our methods honestly, without claiming that every component is necessary or optimal. That said, first place on the leaderboard suggests the overall approach is sound even if we cannot isolate the contribution of each piece. 2 1.5 Code and Models Our code for training and inference is available at https: //github.com/IliaLarchenko/behavior-1k-s olution. We also share our model weights at https://huggingf ace.co/IliaLarchenko/behavior_submission. This code and these weights should allow anyone to reproduce our results.Our work builds on vision-language-action models, flow matching, action chunking, and multi-task learning for robot control. 2.1 Vision-Language-Action Models VLA models fine-tune pretrained vision-language models for robot control, leveraging semantic knowledge from web-scale pretraining. Early VLAs like RT-2 [6] use autoregressive token prediction for actions, which struggles with high-frequency control. Pi0 [2] (and later Pi0.5 [3]) uses flow matching f"

DentalGPT, a specialized dental multimodal large language model, achieves superior performance in disease classification and dental VQA tasks through high-quality domain knowledge injection and reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reliable interpretation of multimodal data in dentistry is essential for automated oral healthcare, yet current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained dental visual details and lack sufficient reasoning ability for precise diagnosis. To address these limitations, we present DentalGPT, a specialized dental MLLM developed through high-quality domain knowledge injection and reinforcement learning. Specifically, the largest annotated multimodal dataset for dentistry to date was constructed by aggregating over 120k dental images paired with detailed descriptions that highlight diagnostically relevant visual features, making it the multimodal dataset with the most extensive collection of dental images to date. Training on this dataset significantly enhances the MLLM's visual understanding of dental conditions, while the subsequent reinforcement learning stage further strengthens its capability for multimodal complex reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on intraoral and panoramic benchmarks, along with dental subsets of medical VQA benchmarks, show that DentalGPT achieves superior performance in disease classification and dental VQA tasks, outperforming many state-of-the-art MLLMs despite having only 7B parameters. These results demonstrate that high-quality dental data combined with staged adaptation provides an effective pathway for building capable and domain-specialized dental MLLMs.

SVG-T2I, a scaled SVG framework, enables high-quality text-to-image synthesis directly in the Visual Foundation Model feature domain, achieving competitive performance in generative tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual generation grounded in Visual Foundation Model (VFM) representations offers a highly promising unified pathway for integrating visual understanding, perception, and generation. Despite this potential, training large-scale text-to-image diffusion models entirely within the VFM representation space remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we scale the SVG (Self-supervised representations for Visual Generation) framework, proposing SVG-T2I to support high-quality text-to-image synthesis directly in the VFM feature domain. By leveraging a standard text-to-image diffusion pipeline, SVG-T2I achieves competitive performance, reaching 0.75 on GenEval and 85.78 on DPG-Bench. This performance validates the intrinsic representational power of VFMs for generative tasks. We fully open-source the project, including the autoencoder and generation model, together with their training, inference, evaluation pipelines, and pre-trained weights, to facilitate further research in representation-driven visual generation.

V-RGBX is an end-to-end framework for intrinsic-aware video editing that combines video inverse rendering, photorealistic synthesis, and keyframe-based editing to produce consistent and physically plausible edits.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large-scale video generation models have shown remarkable potential in modeling photorealistic appearance and lighting interactions in real-world scenes. However, a closed-loop framework that jointly understands intrinsic scene properties (e.g., albedo, normal, material, and irradiance), leverages them for video synthesis, and supports editable intrinsic representations remains unexplored. We present V-RGBX, the first end-to-end framework for intrinsic-aware video editing. V-RGBX unifies three key capabilities: (1) video inverse rendering into intrinsic channels, (2) photorealistic video synthesis from these intrinsic representations, and (3) keyframe-based video editing conditioned on intrinsic channels. At the core of V-RGBX is an interleaved conditioning mechanism that enables intuitive, physically grounded video editing through user-selected keyframes, supporting flexible manipulation of any intrinsic modality. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that V-RGBX produces temporally consistent, photorealistic videos while propagating keyframe edits across sequences in a physically plausible manner. We demonstrate its effectiveness in diverse applications, including object appearance editing and scene-level relighting, surpassing the performance of prior methods.

SAM2VideoX improves realistic motion generation in video models by integrating structure-preserving priors from an autoregressive model into a bidirectional diffusion model with novel feature fusion and local alignment techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reality is a dance between rigid constraints and deformable structures. For video models, that means generating motion that preserves fidelity as well as structure. Despite progress in diffusion models, producing realistic structure-preserving motion remains challenging, especially for articulated and deformable objects such as humans and animals. Scaling training data alone, so far, has failed to resolve physically implausible transitions. Existing approaches rely on conditioning with noisy motion representations, such as optical flow or skeletons extracted using an external imperfect model. To address these challenges, we introduce an algorithm to distill structure-preserving motion priors from an autoregressive video tracking model (SAM2) into a bidirectional video diffusion model (CogVideoX). With our method, we train SAM2VideoX, which contains two innovations: (1) a bidirectional feature fusion module that extracts global structure-preserving motion priors from a recurrent model like SAM2; (2) a Local Gram Flow loss that aligns how local features move together. Experiments on VBench and in human studies show that SAM2VideoX delivers consistent gains (+2.60\% on VBench, 21-22\% lower FVD, and 71.4\% human preference) over prior baselines. Specifically, on VBench, we achieve 95.51\%, surpassing REPA (92.91\%) by 2.60\%, and reduce FVD to 360.57, a 21.20\% and 22.46\% improvement over REPA- and LoRA-finetuning, respectively.

MetaCanvas leverages multimodal large language models as latent-space planners to enhance precise and structured image and video generation, outperforming global-conditioning methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal learning has rapidly advanced visual understanding, largely via multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that use powerful LLMs as cognitive cores. In visual generation, however, these powerful core models are typically reduced to global text encoders for diffusion models, leaving most of their reasoning and planning ability unused. This creates a gap: current multimodal LLMs can parse complex layouts, attributes, and knowledge-intensive scenes, yet struggle to generate images or videos with equally precise and structured control. We propose MetaCanvas, a lightweight framework that lets MLLMs reason and plan directly in spatial and spatiotemporal latent spaces and interface tightly with diffusion generators. We empirically implement MetaCanvas on three different diffusion backbones and evaluate it across six tasks, including text-to-image generation, text/image-to-video generation, image/video editing, and in-context video generation, each requiring precise layouts, robust attribute binding, and reasoning-intensive control. MetaCanvas consistently outperforms global-conditioning baselines, suggesting that treating MLLMs as latent-space planners is a promising direction for narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation.

A model learns to parallelize tasks from a single egocentric video by addressing spatial and object conflicts, achieving improved action coverage and reduced collisions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Humans can intuitively parallelise complex activities, but can a model learn this from observing a single person? Given one egocentric video, we introduce the N-Body Problem: how N individuals, can hypothetically perform the same set of tasks observed in this video. The goal is to maximise speed-up, but naive assignment of video segments to individuals often violates real-world constraints, leading to physically impossible scenarios like two people using the same object or occupying the same space. To address this, we formalise the N-Body Problem and propose a suite of metrics to evaluate both performance (speed-up, task coverage) and feasibility (spatial collisions, object conflicts and causal constraints). We then introduce a structured prompting strategy that guides a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to reason about the 3D environment, object usage, and temporal dependencies to produce a viable parallel execution. On 100 videos from EPIC-Kitchens and HD-EPIC, our method for N = 2 boosts action coverage by 45% over a baseline prompt for Gemini 2.5 Pro, while simultaneously slashing collision rates, object and causal conflicts by 55%, 45% and 55% respectively.

"A model learns to parallelize tasks from a single egocentric video by addressing spatial and object conflicts, achieving improved action coverage and reduced collisions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Humans can intuitively parallelise complex activities, but can a model learn this from observing a single person? Given one egocentric video, we introduce the N-Body Problem: how N individuals, can hypothetically perform the same set of tasks observed in this video. The goal is to maximise speed-up, but naive assignment of video segments to individuals often violates real-world constraints, leading to physically impossible scenarios like two people using the same object or occupying the same space. To address this, we formalise the N-Body Problem and propose a suite of metrics to evaluate both performance (speed-up, task coverage) and feasibility (spatial collisions, object conflicts and causal constraints). We then introduce a structured prompting strategy that guides a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to reason about the 3D environment, object usage, and temporal dependencies to produce a viable parallel execution. On 100 videos from EPIC-Kitchens and HD-EPIC, our method for N = 2 boosts action coverage by 45% over a baseline prompt for Gemini 2.5 Pro, while simultaneously slashing collision rates, object and causal conflicts by 55%, 45% and 55% respectively."

PersonaLive is a diffusion-based framework for real-time portrait animation that enhances speed and efficiency through multi-stage training, hybrid implicit signals, appearance distillation, and autoregressive micro-chunk streaming.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current diffusion-based portrait animation models predominantly focus on enhancing visual quality and expression realism, while overlooking generation latency and real-time performance, which restricts their application range in the live streaming scenario. We propose PersonaLive, a novel diffusion-based framework towards streaming real-time portrait animation with multi-stage training recipes. Specifically, we first adopt hybrid implicit signals, namely implicit facial representations and 3D implicit keypoints, to achieve expressive image-level motion control. Then, a fewer-step appearance distillation strategy is proposed to eliminate appearance redundancy in the denoising process, greatly improving inference efficiency. Finally, we introduce an autoregressive micro-chunk streaming generation paradigm equipped with a sliding training strategy and a historical keyframe mechanism to enable low-latency and stable long-term video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PersonaLive achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 7-22x speedup over prior diffusion-based portrait animation models.

A vision-action policy using correlated noise for flow matching and learnable mixed-layer attention wins the 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge with high performance across diverse household tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present a vision-action policy that won 1st place in the 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge - a large-scale benchmark featuring 50 diverse long-horizon household tasks in photo-realistic simulation, requiring bimanual manipulation, navigation, and context-aware decision making.   Building on the Pi0.5 architecture, we introduce several innovations. Our primary contribution is correlated noise for flow matching, which improves training efficiency and enables correlation-aware inpainting for smooth action sequences. We also apply learnable mixed-layer attention and System 2 stage tracking for ambiguity resolution. Training employs multi-sample flow matching to reduce variance, while inference uses action compression and challenge-specific correction rules.   Our approach achieves 26% q-score across all 50 tasks on both public and private leaderboards.
