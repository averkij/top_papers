Richter, Vladlen Koltun Apple We present SHARPa, an approach to photorealistic view synthesis from single image. Given single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of 3D Gaussian representation of the depicted scene. This is done in less than second on standard GPU via single feedforward pass through neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 2534% and DISTS by 2143% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude. ahttps://github.com/apple/ml-sharp Imagine revisiting precious memory captured on camera. What if technology could lift the scene out of the image plane, recreating the threedimensional world as it was then, putting you back in the scene? High-resolution low-latency AR/VR headsets can convincingly present spatial content. 3D representations can also be rendered on handheld displays. Can these surfaces be used to reconnect us with our memories in new ways? Recent advances in neural rendering (Tewari et al., 2022) have demonstrated remarkable success in synthesizing photorealistic views, but many of the most impressive results leverage multiple input images and conduct time-consuming per-scene optimization. We are interested in view synthesis from single photograph, to support real-time photorealistic rendering from nearby views. Specifically, our application setting yields the following desiderata.

"SHARP synthesizes photorealistic views from a single image using a 3D Gaussian representation, achieving state-of-the-art results with rapid processing.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present SHARP, an approach to photorealistic view synthesis from a single image. Given a single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation of the depicted scene. This is done in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass through a neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets a new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude. Code and weights are provided at https://github.com/apple/ml-sharp"

The paper mentions releasing code and weights on GitHub, which indicates a contribution to open-source projects. While the paper involves neural networks and optimization, these are implementation details rather than the primary focus. The paper is primarily about a specific computer vision application (view synthesis from single images) rather than the broader ML topics listed.
