INTRODUCTION ARGE language models (LLMs) and robotics are two highly prominent fields in current technology. In recent years, growing number of outstanding works have begun to focus on the integration of these two domains. Endowed with powerful natural language understanding and logical reasoning capabilities, LLMs hold considerable research value in the field of robot task planning. In the traditional robotics industry, developers need to manually design corresponding programs with specific logic for individual tasks. These programs suffer from poor flexibility and lack generalization. As task complexity and details increase, the program architecture inevitably becomes cumbersome and overcomplicated. The emergence of LLMs has made us realize that this entity with strong reasoning capabilities can effectively replace the diverse and complex logics that we previously embedded in programs Lihuang Chen, Xiangyu Luo, and Jun Meng are with Zhejiang lihuangchen@zju.edu.cn; University, Hangzhou 310000, China (e-mail: 22360566@zju.edu.cn; junmeng@zju.edu.cn). Corresponding author: Jun Meng. This work was supported by the Pioneer and Leading Goose R&D Program of Zhejiang Province (No. 2024C01170), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52475033) and the Robotics Institute of Zhejiang University under Grant K11801. manually. Indeed, works over the past two years have incorporated LLMs into robot planning to varying degrees. References [1] and [2] present and summarize numerous studies that have verified on different robot platforms, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and robotic arms, that LLMs can effectively enhance the planning performance of specific tasks, make program design more intuitive, and allow direct human-robot interaction. Meanwhile, intelligent agent architectures represented by the ReAct framework [3] have emerged and achieved remarkable development in the field of LLMs, aiming to address LLM task planning and execution problems in pure software applications. This is an exciting emerging subfield, indicating that LLMs also have the potential to be applied in robotics. This would allow LLMs, as the brain, to truly possess the body and tools to control robots performing various physical tasks. In this letter, we conduct in-depth research on the application of intelligent agent frameworks in the robotics domain. We propose self-designed, streamlined, and efficient generalpurpose robotic agent framework, enabling LLMs to independently perform behaviors such as planning, action execution, and reflective adjustment based on user requirements and task information, ultimately achieving self-iterative control of robots to complete tasks. Human users can optionally intervene during task execution to implement interactive behaviors through experiments, we of varying degrees. Furthermore, present the usage suggestions of different technologies for task deployment and human-robot communication from the perspective of ordinary users in this framework. Inspired by existing excellent works, we test and compare the strengths and weaknesses of agent frameworks with different core principles and structures in our designed task scenarios, hoping to provide valuable references for researchers. In summary, our main contributions are as follows: agent intelligent 1) We developed an elegantly structured general-purpose robotic framework called LEORobotAgent. The framework is equipped with humanrobot interaction capabilities. We applied several prompt engineering techniques from the LLMs domain to explore the boundary of the task planning capabilities of LLM within this framework and identified the current problems and challenges faced by LLMs in complex task planning. 2) We provide complete program system built around this framework. The system features simple and easily configurable environment with visual and monitorable operation processes. Users can register various tools in the frameworks toolset module to meet customized PREPRINT VERSION. ACCEPTED TO NOTHING YET. PREPRINT VERSION. 2 3) We verified that requirements. With high flexibility, the framework effectively lowers the threshold for human-robot interaction. this framework can be applied to different types of robots to accomplish tasks of varying complexity across diverse scenarios, exhibiting general applicability and high generalization.

  "desc": "Авторы представляют LEO-RobotAgent — универсальную платформу на основе больших языковых моделей для управления различными типами роботов. Фреймворк позволяет LLM самостоятельно планировать и выполнять сложные задачи в разных сценариях благодаря модульной архитектуре и гибкой системе инструментов. В отличие от существующих подходов, фокусирующихся на отдельных типах роботов и задачах, данное решение обладает высокой обобщаемостью и работает на популярных платформах — беспилотниках, манипуляторах и мобильных роботах. Система включает механизм человеко-робот взаимодействия, что облегчает сотрудничество между человеком и машиной при выполнении задач разной сложности.",

"A general-purpose language-driven framework for robots, LEO-RobotAgent, enhances human-robot interaction and task planning using large language models across various robot types and tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose LEO-RobotAgent, a general-purpose language-driven intelligent agent framework for robots. Under this framework, LLMs can operate different types of robots to complete unpredictable complex tasks across various scenarios. This framework features strong generalization, robustness, and efficiency. The application-level system built around it can fully enhance bidirectional human-robot intent understanding and lower the threshold for human-robot interaction. Regarding robot task planning, the vast majority of existing studies focus on the application of large models in single-task scenarios and for single robot types. These algorithms often have complex structures and lack generalizability. Thus, the proposed LEO-RobotAgent framework is designed with a streamlined structure as much as possible, enabling large models to independently think, plan, and act within this clear framework. We provide a modular and easily registrable toolset, allowing large models to flexibly call various tools to meet different requirements. Meanwhile, the framework incorporates a human-robot interaction mechanism, enabling the algorithm to collaborate with humans like a partner. Experiments have verified that this framework can be easily adapted to mainstream robot platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robotic arms, and wheeled robot, and efficiently execute a variety of carefully designed tasks with different complexity levels.
