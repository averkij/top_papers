Project page: https:// nvlabs.github.io/ Fast-FoundationStereo/ 1. Introduction The field of stereo matching has advanced significantly since its inception exactly 50 years ago [36]. Modern algorithms, driven by an abundance of high-quality training Figure 2. Zero-shot generalization accuracy (on Middlebury-Q dataset) of various stereo methods versus speed, measured on the same hardware NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Our model family achieves real-time performance with only slight decrease in accuracy compared with the best slow method. Green outlined stars are further accelerated by TensorRT. datasets and innovations in deep neural network architectures, now yield impressive results, often approaching saturation on the most demanding benchmarks. Such accuracy is critical for applications requiring precise 3D reconstruction, such as robotics [29] and augmented reality [28]. This remarkable progress, however, has split the field into two distinct research paths [59]. On the one hand, the rise of foundation models in computer vision has pushed stereo research toward strong zero-shot generalization [2, 7, 63, 64]. Such leading zero-shot networks leverage rich priors from computationally intensive foundation models such as DepthAnythingV2 [74] or DINO models [45, 57]; and they employ computationally intensive architectures, such as the Disparity Transformer [64], to perform self-attention for long-range context. Such limitations have, to date, hindered their deployment in any latency-bound system.On the other hand, the non-negotiable constraints of practical applications demand computationally efficient performance. Architectures designed for such real-time inference [21, 31, 70, 71] achieve high frame rates by relying on lightweight backbones, 2D convolutional layers, and local iterative refinement modules. Such methods struggle to generalize due to their reliance upon per-domain finetuning. The difficulty of obtaining the required dense, highquality ground-truth depth at scale has prevented such efficient methods from being used as an off-the-shelf solution for embodied agents operating in in-the-wild environments. this critical gap, we propose FastFoundationStereo  (Fig. 1)  , novel stereo matching approach for both strong zero-shot generalization and realtime inference. Unlike existing real-time methods which sacrifice the rich architectural capacity and typically designed and trained from scratch, our work builds upon the powerful yet computationally intensive FoundationStereo [64]. Addressing its three main components (feature extraction, cost filtering, and disparity refinement), our divide-and-conquer acceleration strategy takes into account the unique properties of each. First, knowledge distillation is leveraged to compress the computationally expensive hybrid feature backbone into single, efficient student backbone that retains the rich monocular and stereo priors. Second, the intensive cost filtering network is divided into blocks, numerous candidate blocks are trained via distillation, and combinatorial search automatically discovers family of effective architectures under varying latency budgets. Third, structured pruning is applied to the refinement module, guided by recurrent dependency graph to identify and remove redundancy, followed by retraining to recover performance. Finally, training is supplemented with large-scale (1.4M pairs) dataset of in-the-wild stereo images, curated via an automatic pseudo-labeling pipeline. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We present Fast-FoundationStereo, novel stereo matching architecture that achieves both strong zero-shot generalization and real-time inference, with varying accuracy-speed trade-off  (Fig. 2)  . Our method significantly outperforms other real-time models by large margin across multiple public datasets, and even outperforms several recent strongly generalizable models. We present several novelties to address the computational bottleneck of common components adopted in modern stereo matching models, while inheriting the strengths from the teacher model. Our divide-and-conquer strategy includes: (1) distillation from hybrid monocular and stereo priors, (2) cost filtering via efficient blockwise architecture search, and (3) iterative refinement via structured pruning. To harness the large diversity, internet-scale abundance and unique realism from in-the-wild stereo images, we propose an automatic pseudo-labeling pipeline to supplement synthetic training data for knowledge distillation. Our code, models and pseudo-labels will be released upon acceptance. 2. Related Work Generalizable Stereo Matching.

Fast-FoundationStereo achieves real-time zero-shot stereo generalization by combining knowledge distillation, blockwise neural architecture search, and structured pruning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Stereo foundation models achieve strong zero-shot generalization but remain computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. Efficient stereo architectures, on the other hand, sacrifice robustness for speed and require costly per-domain fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we present Fast-FoundationStereo, a family of architectures that achieve, for the first time, strong zero-shot generalization at real-time frame rate. We employ a divide-and-conquer acceleration strategy with three components: (1) knowledge distillation to compress the hybrid backbone into a single efficient student; (2) blockwise neural architecture search for automatically discovering optimal cost filtering designs under latency budgets, reducing search complexity exponentially; and (3) structured pruning for eliminating redundancy in the iterative refinement module. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic pseudo-labeling pipeline used to curate 1.4M in-the-wild stereo pairs to supplement synthetic training data and facilitate knowledge distillation. The resulting model can run over 10x faster than FoundationStereo while closely matching its zero-shot accuracy, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art among real-time methods.
