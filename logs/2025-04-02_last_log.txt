Text:"Command A: An Enterprise-Ready Large Language Model Cohere1 Abstract In this report we describe the development of Command A, powerful large language model purpose-built to excel at real-world enterprise use cases. Command is an agent-optimised and multilingual-capable model, with support for 23 languages of global business, and novel hybrid architecture balancing efficiency with top of the range performance. It offers best-in-class Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities with grounding and tool use to automate sophisticated business processes. These abilities are achieved through decentralised training approach, including self-refinement algorithms and model merging techniques. We also include results for Command R7B which shares capability and architectural similarities to Command A. Weights for both models have been released for research purposes. This technical report details our original training pipeline and presents an extensive evaluation of our models across suite of enterprise-relevant tasks and public benchmarks, demonstrating excellent performance and efficiency. This technical report describes the development of Command and Command R7B, two LLMs designed to excel in real-world enterprise settings. Both the 111B parameter Command and Command R7B perform best-in-class across suite of established benchmarks for their respective model sizes. We also highlight key innovations and technical contributions including data and architectural optimisations, self-refinement algorithms, and model merging-based approach optimised to bring out expert-level performance across capabilities within single set of model weights, providing fast and efficient performance.

Command is tailored for excellent performance in enterprise-relevant settings such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where models can interact with, understand, and process information distributed across wide range of documents. As part of this focus, our models also excel in the multilingual setting, supporting 23 key languages of global business: English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Polish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Dutch, Czech, Indonesian, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek, Hindi, Hebrew, and Persian. Along with its impressive overall performance, achieving best-in-class results for any model in its size and efficiency range on common benchmarks such as MATH, Command outperforms across an extensive suite of human evaluation tasks as shown in Figure 1. Furthermore, Command achieves strong results on enterprise-relevant agentic benchmarks such as Taubench, as shown in Table 1. Command focuses on delivering competitive performance as efficiently as possible. With serving footprint of just two A100s or H100s, Command requires considerably less computational overhead than comparable models. This is of particular importance for privacy-preserving enterprise settings and on-premises deployments. Command can deliver tokens at rate of up to 156 tokens/sec which is 1.75x higher than GPT-4o and 2.4x higher than DeepSeek V3. 1Please cite this technical report as Cohere (2025). full author list can be found at the end of this document.

Soft attention is a critical mechanism powering LLMs to locate relevant parts within a given context. However, individual attention weights are determined by the similarity of only a single query and key token vector. This "single token attention" bottlenecks the amount of information used in distinguishing a relevant part from the rest of the context. To address this issue, we propose a new attention method, Multi-Token Attention (MTA), which allows LLMs to condition their attention weights on multiple query and key vectors simultaneously. This is achieved by applying convolution operations over queries, keys and heads, allowing nearby queries and keys to affect each other's attention weights for more precise attention. As a result, our method can locate relevant context using richer, more nuanced information that can exceed a single vector's capacity. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that MTA achieves enhanced performance on a range of popular benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms Transformer baseline models on standard language modeling tasks, and on tasks that require searching for information within long contexts, where our method's ability to leverage richer information proves particularly beneficial.
