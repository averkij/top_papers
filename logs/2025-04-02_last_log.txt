[ 1 4 9 2 0 0 . 4 0 5 2 : r Microsoft Research Code: https://github.com/microsoft/eureka-ml-insightsInference-time scaling can enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on complex problems that benefit from step-by-step problem solving. Although lengthening generated scratchpads has proven effective for mathematical tasks, the broader impact of this approach on other tasks remains less clear. In this work, we investigate the benefits and limitations of scaling methods across nine state-of-the-art models and eight challenging tasks, including math and STEM reasoning, calendar planning, NP-hard problems, navigation, and spatial reasoning. We compare conventional models (e.g., GPT-4o) with models fine-tuned for inference-time scaling (e.g., o1) through evaluation protocols that involve repeated model calls, either independently or sequentially with feedback. These evaluations approximate lower and upper performance bounds and potential for future performance improvements for each model, whether through enhanced training or multi-model inference systems. Our extensive empirical analysis reveals that the advantages of inference-time scaling vary across tasks and diminish as problem complexity increases. In addition, simply using more tokens does not necessarily translate to higher accuracy in these challenging regimes. Results from multiple independent runs with conventional models using perfect verifiers show that, for some tasks, these models can achieve performance close to the average performance of todays most advanced reasoning models. However, for other tasks, significant performance gap remains, even in very high scaling regimes. Encouragingly, all models demonstrate significant gains when inference is further scaled with perfect verifiers or strong feedback, suggesting ample potential for future improvements.Inference-time scaling refers to allocating increasing computational resources during inference of machine learning models to enhance their performance on complex tasks. Recently, this approach has encompassed post-training techniques that encourage models to generate longer and step-by-step solutions, explore different alternatives at each step, or even backtrack to previous steps when an inference path does not appear promising. Several models to date (OpenAI, 2025; Jaech et al., 2024; Anthropic, 2025; Guo et al., 2025; Google, 2025b) exhibit one or more aspects of such desirable behavior at inference time and improve the state of the art on complex tasks. While the exact training techniques and data that enabled major model releases are not always shared, earlier studies and replication surveys (Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a; Zelikman et al., 2022) as well as open source releases (Guo et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024c), introduce techniques for lengthening generation traces via strong verifiers, self-reflection, chain-of-thought finetuning and reinforcement learning (RL). These recipes have shown to be effective for math problems, which remain the main testbed for understanding the impact of inference-time scaling. In this work, we present an extensive 1 Figure 1: Performance of best and worse models on different reasoning benchmarks. The red frontier shows the performance of the worse model. The green frontier shows the performance of the best model, indicating the best known result with current technology. The blue horizon between the best model and the maximum performance shows the room for improvement for mastering the capability. The best performance sets indicated in the green border include all models that perform within 2% of the best observed result. empirical analysis of inference-time scaling for complex tasks, that studies both conventional models and reasoning models (i.e. models tuned for inference-time scaling), and measures their current abilities and future potential, if inference were to be scaled further. First, we present comprehensive study of reasoning capabilities of nine state-of-the-art foundation models for rich set of tasks. We utilize existing open source benchmarks for evaluating problems on math and STEM reasoning, calendar planning, navigation, and spatial reasoning and introduce two new benchmarks for evaluating NP-hard problems. We present performance-cost tradeoffs as well as common failure patterns within and across benchmarks, beyond single-score measurements and leaderboards. Through our analysis, we find that, while all the chosen tasks can benefit from scratchpad-like, step-by-step problem solving (often referred to as reasoning), this paradigm i) does not serve all domains and tasks equally, and ii) improvements diminish with increased problem difficulty. Surprisingly, we also observe that longer generations relative to the same model can sometimes be an indicator of models struggling, rather than improved reflection. Similarly, when comparing different reasoning models, higher token usage is not always associated with better accuracy. These findings motivate the need for more purposeful and cost-effective scaling approaches. Further, we simulate two different types of inference-time scaling approaches. Independent parallel generations sample multiple answers from the same model at high temperature, and then aggregate to obtain final result through different operators. If model reacts positively to such an approach, it shows that there exists at least one correct inference path and that there is still space for improving the models (including those tuned for inferencetime scaling) through stronger verification methods. Another lens on these results is to use them for estimating model reliability and variance across different attempts, or its expected performance in real-world pipelines that implement redundant answer sampling. Sequential generations iteratively leverage the feedback of the same model when the original models answer is incorrect, and pass that feedback to the model under test to give it another opportunity to improve its answer. This setup helps understand the models ability to leverage feedback and also its potential for being involved in generating synthetic data for fine-tuning or RL techniques that may be used offline or online for improv"

To address the bottleneck of accurate user intent interpretation within the current video generation community, we present Any2Caption, a novel framework for controllable video generation under any condition. The key idea is to decouple various condition interpretation steps from the video synthesis step. By leveraging modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), Any2Caption interprets diverse inputs--text, images, videos, and specialized cues such as region, motion, and camera poses--into dense, structured captions that offer backbone video generators with better guidance. We also introduce Any2CapIns, a large-scale dataset with 337K instances and 407K conditions for any-condition-to-caption instruction tuning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate significant improvements of our system in controllability and video quality across various aspects of existing video generation models.

"To address the bottleneck of accurate user intent interpretation within the current video generation community, we present Any2Caption, a novel framework for controllable video generation under any condition. The key idea is to decouple various condition interpretation steps from the video synthesis step. By leveraging modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), Any2Caption interprets diverse inputs--text, images, videos, and specialized cues such as region, motion, and camera poses--into dense, structured captions that offer backbone video generators with better guidance. We also introduce Any2CapIns, a large-scale dataset with 337K instances and 407K conditions for any-condition-to-caption instruction tuning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate significant improvements of our system in controllability and video quality across various aspects of existing video generation models.

Recent advancements in Chain of Thought (COT) generation have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as an effective post-training approach. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit this reasoning potential but remain underexplored in tasks requiring both perception and logical reasoning. To address this, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate post-training methods for MLLMs in video understanding. It includes intricate real-world videos and complex everyday planning tasks in the format of multiple-choice questions, requiring sophisticated perception and reasoning. SEED-Bench-R1 assesses generalization through a three-level hierarchy: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios, equipped with a large-scale training dataset with easily verifiable ground-truth answers. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, we compare RL with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrating RL's data efficiency and superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, even outperforming SFT on general video understanding benchmarks like LongVideoBench. Our detailed analysis reveals that RL enhances visual perception but often produces less logically coherent reasoning chains. We identify key limitations such as inconsistent reasoning and overlooked visual cues, and suggest future improvements in base model reasoning, reward modeling, and RL robustness against noisy signals.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, transitioning from fast and intuitive thinking (System 1) to slow and deep reasoning (System 2). While System 2 reasoning improves task accuracy, it often incurs substantial computational costs due to its slow thinking nature and inefficient or unnecessary reasoning behaviors. In contrast, System 1 reasoning is computationally efficient but leads to suboptimal performance. Consequently, it is critical to balance the trade-off between performance (benefits) and computational costs (budgets), giving rise to the concept of reasoning economy. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of reasoning economy in both the post-training and test-time inference stages of LLMs, encompassing i) the cause of reasoning inefficiency, ii) behavior analysis of different reasoning patterns, and iii) potential solutions to achieve reasoning economy. By offering actionable insights and highlighting open challenges, we aim to shed light on strategies for improving the reasoning economy of LLMs, thereby serving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area.

Visual token reduction lowers inference costs caused by extensive image features in large vision-language models (LVLMs). Unlike relevant studies that prune tokens in self-attention-only LVLMs, our work uniquely addresses cross-attention-based models, which achieve superior performance. We identify that the key-value (KV) cache size for image tokens in cross-attention layers significantly exceeds that of text tokens in self-attention layers, posing a major compute bottleneck. To mitigate this issue, we exploit the sparse nature in cross-attention maps to selectively prune redundant visual features. Our Trimmed Llama effectively reduces KV cache demands without requiring additional training. By benefiting from 50%-reduced visual features, our model can reduce inference latency and memory usage while achieving benchmark parity.

Inference-time scaling can enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on complex problems that benefit from step-by-step problem solving. Although lengthening generated scratchpads has proven effective for mathematical tasks, the broader impact of this approach on other tasks remains less clear. In this work, we investigate the benefits and limitations of scaling methods across nine state-of-the-art models and eight challenging tasks, including math and STEM reasoning, calendar planning, NP-hard problems, navigation, and spatial reasoning. We compare conventional models (e.g., GPT-4o) with models fine-tuned for inference-time scaling (e.g., o1) through evaluation protocols that involve repeated model calls, either independently or sequentially with feedback. These evaluations approximate lower and upper performance bounds and potential for future performance improvements for each model, whether through enhanced training or multi-model inference systems. Our extensive empirical analysis reveals that the advantages of inference-time scaling vary across tasks and diminish as problem complexity increases. In addition, simply using more tokens does not necessarily translate to higher accuracy in these challenging regimes. Results from multiple independent runs with conventional models using perfect verifiers show that, for some tasks, these models can achieve performance close to the average performance of today's most advanced reasoning models. However, for other tasks, a significant performance gap remains, even in very high scaling regimes. Encouragingly, all models demonstrate significant gains when inference is further scaled with perfect verifiers or strong feedback, suggesting ample potential for future improvements.

The rapid escalation from elementary school-level to frontier problems of the difficulty for LLM benchmarks in recent years have weaved a miracle for researchers that we are only inches away from surpassing human intelligence. However, is the LLMs' remarkable reasoning ability indeed comes from true intelligence by human standards, or are they simply reciting solutions witnessed during training at an Internet level? To study this problem, we propose RoR-Bench, a novel, multi-modal benchmark for detecting LLM's recitation behavior when asked simple reasoning problems but with conditions subtly shifted, and conduct empirical analysis on our benchmark. Surprisingly, we found existing cutting-edge LLMs unanimously exhibits extremely severe recitation behavior; by changing one phrase in the condition, top models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 can suffer 60% performance loss on elementary school-level arithmetic and reasoning problems. Such findings are a wake-up call to the LLM community that compels us to re-evaluate the true intelligence level of cutting-edge LLMs.
