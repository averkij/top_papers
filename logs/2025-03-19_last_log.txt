Text:"5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 1 1 1 3 1 . 3 0 5 2 : r MM-Spatial: Exploring 3D Spatial Understanding in Multimodal LLMsNina Wenzel David GriffithsFigure 1.

(Right) We train MM-Spatial, generalist multimodal LLM that excels at 3D spatial understanding. It supports Chain-of-Thought spatial reasoning involving 2D grounding and depth estimation, and can also leverage depth input via tool-use.1. Introduction Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at 2D visual understanding but remain limited in their ability to reason about 3D space. In this work, we leverage largescale high-quality 3D scene data with open-set annotations to introduce 1) novel supervised fine-tuning dataset and 2) new evaluation benchmark, focused on indoor scenes. Our Cubify Anything VQA (CA-VQA) data covers diverse tasks including spatial relationship prediction, spatial metric size and distance estimation, and 3D grounding. We show that CA-VQA enables us to train MM-Spatial, strong generalist MLLM that also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including our own. We show how incorporating metric depth and multi-view inputs (provided in CA-VQA) can further improve 3D understanding, and demonstrate that data alone allows our model to achieve depth perception capabilities comparable to dedicated monocular depth estimation models. We will publish our SFT dataset and benchmark. Understanding object locations and spatial relationships in both 2D and 3D space is crucial for interpreting complex visual scenes. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved notable success for 2D visual tasks including referring and grounding [122, 127] and spatial relation prediction (e.g., left vs. right, above vs. below) [27], they still struggle with 3D object perception tasks such as estimating 1) relative depth (in front vs. behind), 2) object distances or sizes in metric units (A is 2.74m away / 1.32m wide.), and, ultimately, 3) precise 3D bounding boxes. Yet, the ability to reason about objects in 3D scenes is not only part of general visual comprehension, but is also foundational in domains like robotics and AR / VR, e.g., for navigation and manipulation tasks [83]. There have been comparatively few works on 3D object perception with MLLMs [15, 20, 27, 28, 32, 98]; moreover, they only consider subset of tasks, and do not comprehensively assess depth and multi-view inputs. To address these Equal contribution.

Comparison of object-centric 3D spatial MLLM datasets to CA-VQA (in gray: non-public ones). CA-VQA is the first dataset that is based on high-quality 3D ground truth, includes depth maps (both from sensors and monocular) and multi-view images, covers variety of tasks (relationships, metric estimation, 3D grounding), and has both an SFT dataset and benchmark. limitations and facilitate more holistic exploration of 3D understanding in MLLMs, we make these contributions: 1. We propose new data generation pipeline that leverages high-quality 3D scene data to produce image-text QA pairs for 3D object perception. We apply this pipeline to CA-1M [61] to generate Cubify Anything VQA (CAVQA), new spatial understanding dataset for MLLM fine-tuning, covering diverse indoor scenes. As additional inputs, CA-VQA uniquely includes multi-view images and different types of metric depth maps, both sensor-based and SOTA monocular (estimated) depth. 2. We release new spatial understanding benchmark derived from CA-VQA. Compared to existing benchmarks, ours 1) includes diverse tasks (incl. relative and metric distance / size estimation and 3D grounding), 2) provides rich input signals (multi-view and depth), and 3) is less susceptible to language priors (i.e., more vision-reliant) and hence more challenging. We show that even SOTA models such as GPT-4o struggle on our benchmark. 3. We run extensive experiments illustrating the benefits of CA-VQA as testbed for spatial perception research. We show that 1) we can train MM-Spatial, generalist MLLM achieving SOTA on spatial understanding benchmarks (CV-Bench, SpatialRGPT-Bench, CA-VQA), while retaining performance on other tasks (incl. general, knowledge, text-rich); 2) using multi-view and depth inputs further enhances 3D understanding; 3) MLLMs can achieve strong monocular depth estimation via SFT. We also study the efficacy of different depth maps, the impact of full encoding vs. tool-use for leveraging depth, and indoor-to-outdoor scene generalization. 2. Related Work 2.1. General MLLMs MLLMs [49, 50, 64, 86, 103] have attracted significant research focus, tracing back to Frozen [106] and Flamingo [6, 8], with more recent works such as LLaVA [80] and MiniGPT-4 [140] introducing visual instruction tuning. The rise of open-source MLLMs has led to models rivaling SOTA commercial offerings like GPT-4o on certain tasks. Notable examples include Emu2 [100, 101], VILA [76], Idefics2/3 [59, 60], and Qwen2-VL [10], among others. MLLMs research has explored several fronts: (i) scaling up the pre-training data [9, 68, 76, 85, 115] and supervised fine-tuning data [48, 60, 102, 104]; (ii) enhancing highresolution image compre"

Generating flexible-view 3D scenes, including 360{\deg} rotation and zooming, from single images is challenging due to a lack of 3D data. To this end, we introduce FlexWorld, a novel framework consisting of two key components: (1) a strong video-to-video (V2V) diffusion model to generate high-quality novel view images from incomplete input rendered from a coarse scene, and (2) a progressive expansion process to construct a complete 3D scene. In particular, leveraging an advanced pre-trained video model and accurate depth-estimated training pairs, our V2V model can generate novel views under large camera pose variations. Building upon it, FlexWorld progressively generates new 3D content and integrates it into the global scene through geometry-aware scene fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FlexWorld in generating high-quality novel view videos and flexible-view 3D scenes from single images, achieving superior visual quality under multiple popular metrics and datasets compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitatively, we highlight that FlexWorld can generate high-fidelity scenes with flexible views like 360{\deg} rotations and zooming. Project page: https://ml-gsai.github.io/FlexWorld.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at 2D visual understanding but remain limited in their ability to reason about 3D space. In this work, we leverage large-scale high-quality 3D scene data with open-set annotations to introduce 1) a novel supervised fine-tuning dataset and 2) a new evaluation benchmark, focused on indoor scenes. Our Cubify Anything VQA (CA-VQA) data covers diverse spatial tasks including spatial relationship prediction, metric size and distance estimation, and 3D grounding. We show that CA-VQA enables us to train MM-Spatial, a strong generalist MLLM that also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including our own. We show how incorporating metric depth and multi-view inputs (provided in CA-VQA) can further improve 3D understanding, and demonstrate that data alone allows our model to achieve depth perception capabilities comparable to dedicated monocular depth estimation models. We will publish our SFT dataset and benchmark.

"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at 2D visual understanding but remain limited in their ability to reason about 3D space. In this work, we leverage large-scale high-quality 3D scene data with open-set annotations to introduce 1) a novel supervised fine-tuning dataset and 2) a new evaluation benchmark, focused on indoor scenes. Our Cubify Anything VQA (CA-VQA) data covers diverse spatial tasks including spatial relationship prediction, metric size and distance estimation, and 3D grounding. We show that CA-VQA enables us to train MM-Spatial, a strong generalist MLLM that also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including our own. We show how incorporating metric depth and multi-view inputs (provided in CA-VQA) can further improve 3D understanding, and demonstrate that data alone allows our model to achieve depth perception capabilities comparable to dedicated monocular depth estimation models. We will publish our SFT dataset and benchmark."
