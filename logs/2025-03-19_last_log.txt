Index TermsMultimodal Large Language Model, MLLM Alignment, Alignment with Human Preference.L LMS have ushered in new era for artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), demonstrating remarkable abilities such as instruction-following and few-shot learning [1], which stem from their extensive model parameters and vast training data. These models represent paradigm shift from traditional, task-speciﬁc models, as LLMs can handle wide variety of general tasks with simple prompt, without the need for task-speciﬁc training. This capability has fundamentally changed the AI landscape. However, while LLMs excel in text processing, they are limited by their inability to process multimodal data. Our world, on the other hand, is inherently multimodal, comprising visual, auditory, textual and other forms of data. This limitation has inspired the development of MLLMs [2], which extend LLMs by incorporating the ability to process and understand multimodal data. MLLMs open up new opportunities for applications that require the integration and understanding of multiple types of data, expanding the potential of AI. Despite the impressive potential demonstrated by MLLMs in tackling complex tasks that involve visual, auYi-Fan Zhang is the project leader: yifanzhang.cs@gmail.com.

Typically, these models only advance to the supervised ﬁne-tuning (SFT) phase, with critical issues related to authenticity, safety, and alignment with human preference remaining inadequately addressed. This gap has led to the emergence of various alignment algorithms, each targeting different application areas and optimization goals. However, this rapid development (Figure 1) also presents number of challenges for researchers, particularly in areas such as benchmarking, optimizing alignment data, and introducing novel algorithms. In response, this paper provides comprehensive and systematic review of alignment algorithms, focusing on the following four key questions: What application scenarios do existing alignment algorithms cover? We categorize current alignment algorithms based on their application scenarios in Figure 2, offering clear framework for researchers across different domains. We also establish uniﬁed symbolic system to aid researchers in understanding the distinctions and connections between various algorithms, which is summarized in Table 1. How are alignment datasets constructed? The creation of alignment datasets involves three core factors: data sources, model responses, and preference annotations. We perform systematic analysis and categorization of these factors (publicly available datasets are summarized in Table 2), highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of current construction methods and highlighting key considerations that need to be addressed. JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, OCTOBER 2024 2 Fig. 1: timeline of MLLM alignment algorithms. How are alignment algorithms evaluated? Given that most alignment algorithms are designed for speciﬁc taskssuch as addressing hallucinations, ensuring safety, and improving reasoningwe categorize and organize common alignment algorithm benchmarks, providing clear framework for evaluation. What are the future directions for the development of alignment algorithms? We propose several potential future directions, such as the integration of visual information into alignment algorithms, insights from LLM alignment methods, and the challenges and opportunities posed by MLLMs as agents. Although many existing surveys focus on the alignment of AI [10], [2], [11], none of them speciﬁcally address the alignment of MLLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the ﬁrst "

Image captioning has been a longstanding challenge in vision-language research. With the rise of LLMs, modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) generate detailed and comprehensive image descriptions. However, benchmarking the quality of such captions remains unresolved. This paper addresses two key questions: (1) How well do current VLMs actually perform on image captioning, particularly compared to humans? We built CapArena, a platform with over 6000 pairwise caption battles and high-quality human preference votes. Our arena-style evaluation marks a milestone, showing that leading models like GPT-4o achieve or even surpass human performance, while most open-source models lag behind. (2) Can automated metrics reliably assess detailed caption quality? Using human annotations from CapArena, we evaluate traditional and recent captioning metrics, as well as VLM-as-a-Judge. Our analysis reveals that while some metrics (e.g., METEOR) show decent caption-level agreement with humans, their systematic biases lead to inconsistencies in model ranking. In contrast, VLM-as-a-Judge demonstrates robust discernment at both the caption and model levels. Building on these insights, we release CapArena-Auto, an accurate and efficient automated benchmark for detailed captioning, achieving 94.3% correlation with human rankings at just $4 per test.

Large language models (LLMs) can handle a wide variety of general tasks with simple prompts, without the need for task-specific training. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built upon LLMs, have demonstrated impressive potential in tackling complex tasks involving visual, auditory, and textual data. However, critical issues related to truthfulness, safety, o1-like reasoning, and alignment with human preference remain insufficiently addressed. This gap has spurred the emergence of various alignment algorithms, each targeting different application scenarios and optimization goals. Recent studies have shown that alignment algorithms are a powerful approach to resolving the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of alignment algorithms for MLLMs. Specifically, we explore four key aspects: (1) the application scenarios covered by alignment algorithms, including general image understanding, multi-image, video, and audio, and extended multimodal applications; (2) the core factors in constructing alignment datasets, including data sources, model responses, and preference annotations; (3) the benchmarks used to evaluate alignment algorithms; and (4) a discussion of potential future directions for the development of alignment algorithms. This work seeks to help researchers organize current advancements in the field and inspire better alignment methods.

The predominant approach to advancing text-to-image generation has been training-time scaling, where larger models are trained on more data using greater computational resources. While effective, this approach is computationally expensive, leading to growing interest in inference-time scaling to improve performance. Currently, inference-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models is largely limited to best-of-N sampling, where multiple images are generated per prompt and a selection model chooses the best output. Inspired by the recent success of reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 in the language domain, we introduce an alternative to naive best-of-N sampling by equipping text-to-image Diffusion Transformers with in-context reflection capabilities. We propose Reflect-DiT, a method that enables Diffusion Transformers to refine their generations using in-context examples of previously generated images alongside textual feedback describing necessary improvements. Instead of passively relying on random sampling and hoping for a better result in a future generation, Reflect-DiT explicitly tailors its generations to address specific aspects requiring enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that Reflect-DiT improves performance on the GenEval benchmark (+0.19) using SANA-1.0-1.6B as a base model. Additionally, it achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 0.81 on GenEval while generating only 20 samples per prompt, surpassing the previous best score of 0.80, which was obtained using a significantly larger model (SANA-1.5-4.8B) with 2048 samples under the best-of-N approach.

"The predominant approach to advancing text-to-image generation has been training-time scaling, where larger models are trained on more data using greater computational resources. While effective, this approach is computationally expensive, leading to growing interest in inference-time scaling to improve performance. Currently, inference-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models is largely limited to best-of-N sampling, where multiple images are generated per prompt and a selection model chooses the best output. Inspired by the recent success of reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 in the language domain, we introduce an alternative to naive best-of-N sampling by equipping text-to-image Diffusion Transformers with in-context reflection capabilities. We propose Reflect-DiT, a method that enables Diffusion Transformers to refine their generations using in-context examples of previously generated images alongside textual feedback describing necessary improvements. Instead of passively relying on random sampling and hoping for a better result in a future generation, Reflect-DiT explicitly tailors its generations to address specific aspects requiring enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that Reflect-DiT improves performance on the GenEval benchmark (+0.19) using SANA-1.0-1.6B as a base model. Additionally, it achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 0.81 on GenEval while generating only 20 samples per prompt, surpassing the previous best score of 0.80, which was obtained using a significantly larger model (SANA-1.5-4.8B) with 2048 samples under the best-of-N approach."
