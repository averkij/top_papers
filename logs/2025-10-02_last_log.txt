To facilitate this transition we introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides standardized framework for the environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also features diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide set of baselines across 24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), whichunlike GRPOis compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both singleand multi-turn settings using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions as convenient evaluation toolkit besides training environment. We hope this framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research1.

Text:"5 2 0 2 1 ] . [ 1 0 1 5 0 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r JoyAgent-JDGenie: Technical Report on the GAIA JINGDONG CHO-EI TeamLarge Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for solving complex real-world tasks. Yet, existing systems often emphasize isolated improvementssuch as expanding toolkits, refining prompts, or adjusting planning heuristicswithout unifying framework to ensure robustness, adaptability, and reproducibility. In this work, we present generalist agent architecture that integrates three core components: (i) collective multi-agent framework of PlanExecute and ReAct agents coordinated through critic model voting, balancing stability with flexibility; (ii) hierarchical memory system combining working, semantic, and procedural layers to enable long-horizon continuity and adaptive control; and (iii) refined tool suite focused on search, code execution, and multimodal parsing, exposed through schema-consistent and auditable interfaces. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark [60], our framework achieves 75.2 Pass@1 and 82.4 Pass@3 on validation, and 67.1a Pass@1 on test set, surpassing open-source baselines and approaching the performance of proprietary systems. These results underscore the importance of system-level integration for advancing generalist agents. Beyond immediate gains, our work highlights path toward scalable, resilient, and adaptive AI assistants capable of operating across domains and tasks. Date: October 2, 2025 Code: https://github.com/jd-opensource/joyagent-jdgenie ahttps://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboardThe pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) increasingly centers on agents: autonomous systems that can plan, reason, and act across diverse real-world tasks. Unlike conventional large language models (LLMs), which excel primarily at text generation, agentic systems must integrate reasoning with external actions, leverage memory across interactions, and adapt dynamically to unforeseen contexts. This shift positions LLM-based agents not just as conversational tools, but as general-purpose assistants capable of problem solving in open-ended, multi-modal, and continuously evolving environments. Over the past two years, wide range of agent frameworks have emerged. Early role-based multi-agent systems such as CAMEL [47] and MetaGPT [32] demonstrated that structured collaboration could elicit disciplined reasoning behaviors, while more recent initiatives like OAgents [112], AWorld [4], Alita [67], and OWL [33] highlight new design philosophies: empirical scaling studies, co-evolutionary training loops, meta-tool creation, and modular planners. Benchmarks such as GAIA [60] have revealed both the promise and the limitations of these systemswhile they achieve notable progress, many approaches remain brittle, either due to over-reliance on hand-crafted workflows or lack of stability under real-world uncertainty. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing system-level framework that integrates three core 1 Figure 1 The overview of the fusion agent architecture. components: (i) heterogeneous ensemble of agents spanning both PlanExecute and ReAct paradigms, coordinated through posterior voting to balance reliability and adaptability; (ii) hierarchical memory design that combines working, semantic, and procedural layers to enable long-horizon continuity and adaptive control; and (iii) refined tool ecosystem emphasizing search, code execution, and multimodal parsing, each wrapped into schema-consistent and auditable interfaces. Together, these design choices yield robust performance gains on the GAIA benchmark, setting state-of-the-art results among open-source systems and narrowing the gap to proprietary frameworks.The study of LLM-based agents has progressed from role-specialized collaborations to increasingly modular systems oriented toward general assistance. Early frameworks such as CAMEL [47] and MetaGPT [32] showed that assigning distinct roles and procedures elicits more disciplined reasoning, especially in structured domains like software engineering. As evaluations moved toward open-ended tasks, recent efforts emphasized broader empirical analysis and unified infrastructures: OAgents [112] systematically studies design choices for effective agents at scale, while AWorld [4] provides unified playground that supports both computerand phone-use tasks, encouraging iteration on the full stack of planning, tools, and evaluation. In parallel, Alita [67] advances the idea that tools themselves can be dynamically constructed and composed, reducing reliance on heavy predefinition and enabling self-evolution of agent capabilities. Complementary platforms (e.g., AutoAgent [83]) lower the barrier to assembling agents and workflows, making orchestration more accessible without sacrificing modularity. second thread concerns the substrate that turns models into reliable systems: tools, retrieval, and memory. Toolformer [73] demonstrated that models can self-learn to call APIs, and surveys such as Qin et al.[66] underscored that robust tool interfaces and execution traces are core to stability. Hierarchical research agents (e.g., Open Deep Research[43] and DeepResearchAgent [104]) pair retrieval-centric planning with iterative decomposition, while memory mechanisms progress from reflective feedback [75] to hierarchical designs like A-Mem [100] that separate working, semantic, and procedural layerssupporting long-horizon continuity and adaptive control. These system utilities collectively motivate architectures where communication is structured, tool calls are auditable, and prior experience can be retrieved and reused. Finally, generalization across domains has become central goal. OWL [33] tackles this by decoupling domainagnostic planning from domain-specific execution (WORKFORCE), training only the plannervia supervised trajectories and reinforcement learningto transfer across new environments without retraining worker 2 agents. Orthogonal efforts (e.g., AgentRefine [23], TapeAgents [6], and MiroFlow [84]) study reproducibility, refinement, and stability at scale. Benchmarks such as GAIA [60] and BrowseComp [95] crystallize these trends by testing multimodal reasoning, browsing, and execution, revealing that while proprietary frameworks (e.g., Deep Research [61], h2oGPTe [29]) are strong, open-source systems are rapidly closing the gap. Distinct from the above, our work contributes system-level design that intentionally fus"

Reverse-engineering a model that learns multi-digit multiplication via implicit chain-of-thought reveals that it uses attention to encode long-range dependencies and represents partial products efficiently, insights that help address limitations in standard fine-tuning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via implicit chain-of-thought, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve'' pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe, which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the correct inductive bias can address this issue.

Research identifies probability-based objectives that outperform negative log likelihood for fine-tuning large language models, depending on model capability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood (NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch, post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight low-probability tokens (e.g., -p, -p^{10}, thresholded variants) consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability.

Code2Video generates educational videos using a code-centric agent framework, improving coherence and interpretability compared to direct code generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions, limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g., code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency; and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced, discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos. Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable, interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video.

"Code2Video generates educational videos using a code-centric agent framework, improving coherence and interpretability compared to direct code generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions, limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g., code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency; and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced, discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos. Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable, interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video."

BiasFreeBench evaluates bias mitigation techniques in large language models using a unified benchmark and response-level metric to ensure fair and safe outputs in real-world scenarios.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs) use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types. We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed for bias mitigation research.

GEM, an open-source environment simulator, facilitates experience-based learning for large language models by providing a standardized framework and diverse environments for training and benchmarking reinforcement learning algorithms.  					AI-generated summary 				 The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across 24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which -- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

In-place feedback allows users to directly edit LLM responses, improving performance and reducing token usage in multi-turn reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback while using 79.1% fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

"In-place feedback allows users to directly edit LLM responses, improving performance and reducing token usage in multi-turn reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback while using 79.1% fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks."

Two fundamental properties of reinforcement learning-induced parameter updates in large language models are identified, leading to a plug-in acceleration framework that significantly speeds up training without sacrificing performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1 Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window, achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

GUI-KV, a KV cache compression method for GUI agents, improves efficiency by exploiting spatial and temporal redundancies, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However, they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this, storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers. This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i) spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii) temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets. Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

A generalist agent architecture combining multi-agent planning, hierarchical memory, and a refined tool suite outperforms existing systems in diverse tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for complex real-world tasks, yet existing systems often focus on isolated improvements without a unifying design for robustness and adaptability. We propose a generalist agent architecture that integrates three core components: a collective multi-agent framework combining planning and execution agents with critic model voting, a hierarchical memory system spanning working, semantic, and procedural layers, and a refined tool suite for search, code execution, and multimodal parsing. Evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark, our framework consistently outperforms open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary systems. These results demonstrate the importance of system-level integration and highlight a path toward scalable, resilient, and adaptive AI assistants capable of operating across diverse domains and tasks.

VLA-RFT uses a data-driven world model to fine-tune VLA models efficiently, reducing sample requirements and improving robustness under perturbations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable embodied decision-making but rely heavily on imitation learning, leading to compounding errors and poor robustness under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator. Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense, trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the generalization and robustness of VLA models.

Hybrid data synthesis and perception-focused supervision improve the reliability of Vision-Language Process Reward Models (VL-PRMs) in guiding VLMs across diverse multimodal benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work, we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and support the advancement of VLMs.

Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and support the advancement of VLMs."
