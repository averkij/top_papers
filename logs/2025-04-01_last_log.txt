In contrast, text data is abundant and inexpensive, prompting the question: can highquality multimodal training data be synthesized purely from text? To tackle this, we propose cross-integrated three-stage multimodal data synthesis framework, which generates two datasets: Unicorn-1.2M and Unicorn-471K-Instruction. In Stage 1: Diverse Caption Data Synthesis, we construct 1.2M semantically diverse high-quality captions by expanding sparse caption seeds usIn Stage ing large language models (LLMs). 2: Instruction-Tuning Data Generation, we further process 471K captions into multi-turn instruction-tuning tasks to support complex reasoning. Finally, in Stage 3: Modality Representation Transfer, these textual captions representations are transformed into visual representations, resulting in diverse synthetic image representations. This three-stage process enables us to construct Unicorn-1.2M for pretraining and Unicorn-471K-Instruction for instructiontuning, without relying on real images. By eliminating the dependency on real images while maintaining data quality and diversity, our framework offers cost-effective and scalable solution for VLMs training.

Introduction The rapid advancement of VLMs (Liu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024c) has underscored the critical importance of large-scale, high-quality image-text pair train1Xreal 2Westlake University 3Zhejiang University 4Shanghai AI Lab 5Nanyang Technological University 6Beihang University 7The Great Bay University. Correspondence to: Xiaomin Yu <xmyu02@gmail.com>. Figure 1. Unlike traditional image-text data synthesis frameworks, Unicorn removes the dependency on real image data, offering more efficient and scalable solution by cutting down API costs, synthesis time, and storage requirements. ing data (Chen et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2024). However, scaling up such high-quality data remains an enduring challenge, constraining the potential for further breakthroughs in VLMs. Traditional methods for acquiring image-text pairs primarily rely on two strategies: (1) Manual annotation (Lin et al., 2015; Plummer et al., 2016). Manual annotation ensures quality but is constrained by cost, scale, and diversity. (2) Large-scale web crawling (Sharma et al., 2018) is scalable but introduces issues such as inconsistent data quality, compliance risks, and copyright concerns. Recent works, such as ShareGPT4V (Chen et al., 2023), have explored augmenting real images with fine-grained captions generated by advanced models like GPT-4v, resulting in highquality datasets that achieve notable improvements in visuallanguage tasks. However, such synthetic data methods still face significant cost constraints. In contrast, text data (Wu et al., 2024; Long et al., 2024) is abundant, inexpensive, and diversified, presenting an untapped opportunity. This raises fundamental question: Can we synthesize high1 Unicorn: Text-Only Data Synthesis for Vision Language Model Training quality multimodal training data for VLMs using only text, without relying on real/synthetic images? The answer is affirmative: recent studies have revealed that cross-modality representation transfer can be achieved in training-free way (Zhang et al., 2024) by exploiting the geometric structure of multimodal contrastive representation spaces (Liang et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). While this phenomenon has been explored in small-scale tasks such as image captioning (Tewel et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023b) and visual question answering (Gu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024e), its potential for generating large-scale synthetic data has yet to be fully realized. Building on this insight, as shown in Fig. 1, we propose scalable multimodal synthetic data framework, termed Unicorn, that mitigates the modality gap (Liang et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023) to eliminate the dependency on real images. By utilizing the geometry of the shared representation space (Zhang et al., 2024), Unicorn generates high-quality synthetic pretraining and instruction-tuning data directly from text. Unicorn not only significantly lowers costs but also enables efficient construction of diverse, high-quality VLM training datasets, providing novel large-scale data synthesis method for VLM training. Unicorn adopts cross-integrated three-stage pipeline to construct diverse, high-quality multimodal datasets. Importantly, the first two stages synthesize data entirely within the textual modality, while the final stage performs the critical transfer from text representation space to visual representation space. This process produces two key datasets: Unicorn-1.2M for multimodal pretraining and Unicorn471K-Instruction for instruction-tuning. Specifically, in Stage 1: Diverse Caption Data Synthesis, Qwen2.5-72BInstruction (Yang et al., 2024) is used to add detailed information to 1.2M sparse caption seeds. The process ultimately yields 1.2M textual diverse captions. These diverse captions include both open-domain (Lin et al., 2015; Plummer et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2018; Ordonez et al., 2011) and domain-specific content (Horn et al., 2021; Kaur et al., 2019), as the foundation for subsequent stages. In Stage 2: Instruction-Tuning Data Generation, 471K captions from Stage 1 are utilized with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruction (Yang et al., 2024) to generate instruction-tuning data encompassing three tasks: multiple-choice, question-answering, and complex reasoning. Finally, in Stage 3: Modality Representation Transfer, we transfer (Liang et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024) the diverse caption representations encoded by LLM2CLIP (Huang et al., 2024) into the visual representation space, obtaining synthetic image representations. Ultimately, we synthesize two datasets: Unicorn-1.2M for pretraining and Unicorn-471K-Instruction for instructiontuning. Overall, Unicorn enables cost-efficient, scalable, and high-quality multimodal dataset generation without relying on real images. Using the synthetic datasets Unicorn-1.2M and Unicorn471K-Instruc"

Training vision-language models (VLMs) typically requires large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs, but collecting or synthesizing such data is costly. In contrast, text data is abundant and inexpensive, prompting the question: can high-quality multimodal training data be synthesized purely from text? To tackle this, we propose a cross-integrated three-stage multimodal data synthesis framework, which generates two datasets: Unicorn-1.2M and Unicorn-471K-Instruction. In Stage 1: Diverse Caption Data Synthesis, we construct 1.2M semantically diverse high-quality captions by expanding sparse caption seeds using large language models (LLMs). In Stage 2: Instruction-Tuning Data Generation, we further process 471K captions into multi-turn instruction-tuning tasks to support complex reasoning. Finally, in Stage 3: Modality Representation Transfer, these textual captions representations are transformed into visual representations, resulting in diverse synthetic image representations. This three-stage process enables us to construct Unicorn-1.2M for pretraining and Unicorn-471K-Instruction for instruction-tuning, without relying on real images. By eliminating the dependency on real images while maintaining data quality and diversity, our framework offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for VLMs training.
