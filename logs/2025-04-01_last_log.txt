INTRODUCTION In many real-world optimization problems (e.g., material design [1], [2], energy management [3], [4], network optimization [5], and portfolio optimization [6]), decision-makers must consider multiple (and often conflicting) objectives simultaneously. Without loss of generality, such multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) can be defined as: minimize f (x) = (f1(x), f2(x), . . . , fm(x)), (1) where = (x1, x2, . . . , xd) Rd is the decision vector and is the number of decision variables. : Rm maps the decision vector to an m-dimensional objective space. Each fi : for = 1, . . . , represents an objective function that needs to be minimized (or maximized). The key challenge in solving MOPs is to identify set of tradeoff solutions known as the Pareto set (PS), where no single Zhenyu Liang, Hao Li, Naiwei Yu, and Kebin Sun are with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China.

E-mail: ranchengcn@gmail.com. (Corresponding author: Ran Cheng) solution can optimize all objectives simultaneously. This set contains all Pareto-optimal or non-dominated solutions, and their corresponding points in the objective space collectively form the Pareto front (PF). Over the past two decades, the field of evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) [7], [8] has seen rapid advancements, resulting in the development of various effective algorithms for solving MOPs. Broadly, these algorithms can be categorized into three main methods: dominance-based, decomposition-based, and indicator-based. Dominance-based algorithms, such as NSGA-II [9] and NSGA-III [10], select solutions based on dominance relations between individuals. Decomposition-based algorithms, like MOEA/D [11], break down an MOP into multiple simpler subproblems, which are optimized collaboratively. Indicator-based algorithms, such as HypE [12], focus on optimizing specific performance indicators, like hypervolume (HV) [13]. While EMO algorithms have proven effective in solving various MOPs, their performance is significantly constrained by limitations in computing power. First, since the majority of existing EMO algorithms still rely on CPUs for execution, their computational efficiency is inherently limited, particularly when addressing large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs) [14]. Second, the inconsistent implementation of EMO algorithms across different methods has led to fragmentation, making it difficult to standardize solutions and apply them across diverse domains. Without unified framework, efforts to generalize these algorithms and enhance computational efficiency are impeded. Third, much of the current research remains focused on relatively simpler numerical optimization tasks, often neglecting computationally intensive real-world applications. This narrow focus further limits the practical use of EMO algorithms in scenarios where real-time performance and scalability are crucial. To address these limitations, one promising method is to incorporate modern computational accelerators such as GPUs. With their powerful parallel processing capabilities, GPUs have demonstrated significant performance improvements in fields like deep learning [15]. However, to fully leverage the potential of GPUs for EMO algorithms, systematic method of parallelization is necessary, yet little effort has been made in this direction so far. Given the high concurrency enabled by the large number of tensor cores [16], GPUs are particularly well-suited for efficient handling and acceleration of large-scale data processing. Correspondingly, one promising method for parallelization on GPUs is tensorization, i.e., representing data structures and operations as tensors. Building upon this IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, 2025 concept, we introduce concise and general tensorization methodology for accelerating EMO algorithms on GPUs. By leveraging tensor operations and the inherent parallelism of GPUs, this methodology systematically explains how to transform EMO algorithms into concise tensor representations. Using this methodology, we implement tensorized versions of three representative EMO algorithms from each category: the dominance-based NSGA-III [10], the decomposition-based MOEA/D [11], and the indicator-based HypE [12]. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of tensorized EMO algorithms in GPU computing environments, we develop multiobject"

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various artificial intelligence problems. However, they fail to plan reliably, even when prompted with a detailed definition of the planning task. Attempts to improve their planning capabilities, such as chain-of-thought prompting, fine-tuning, and explicit "reasoning" still yield incorrect plans and usually fail to generalize to larger tasks. In this paper, we show how to use LLMs to generate correct plans, even for out-of-distribution tasks of increasing size. For a given planning domain, we ask an LLM to generate several domain-dependent heuristic functions in the form of Python code, evaluate them on a set of training tasks within a greedy best-first search, and choose the strongest one. The resulting LLM-generated heuristics solve many more unseen test tasks than state-of-the-art domain-independent heuristics for classical planning. They are even competitive with the strongest learning algorithm for domain-dependent planning. These findings are especially remarkable given that our proof-of-concept implementation is based on an unoptimized Python planner and the baselines all build upon highly optimized C++ code. In some domains, the LLM-generated heuristics expand fewer states than the baselines, revealing that they are not only efficiently computable, but sometimes even more informative than the state-of-the-art heuristics. Overall, our results show that sampling a set of planning heuristic function programs can significantly improve the planning capabilities of LLMs.

Recent advancements in video generation have achieved impressive motion realism, yet they often overlook character-driven storytelling, a crucial task for automated film, animation generation. We introduce Talking Characters, a more realistic task to generate talking character animations directly from speech and text. Unlike talking head, Talking Characters aims at generating the full portrait of one or more characters beyond the facial region. In this paper, we propose MoCha, the first of its kind to generate talking characters. To ensure precise synchronization between video and speech, we propose a speech-video window attention mechanism that effectively aligns speech and video tokens. To address the scarcity of large-scale speech-labeled video datasets, we introduce a joint training strategy that leverages both speech-labeled and text-labeled video data, significantly improving generalization across diverse character actions. We also design structured prompt templates with character tags, enabling, for the first time, multi-character conversation with turn-based dialogue-allowing AI-generated characters to engage in context-aware conversations with cinematic coherence. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including human preference studies and benchmark comparisons, demonstrate that MoCha sets a new standard for AI-generated cinematic storytelling, achieving superior realism, expressiveness, controllability and generalization.

Reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps prior to generating final answers, helping the model excel in complex problem-solving. In this paper, we demonstrate that this emerging generation framework offers a unique opportunity for more fine-grained control over model behavior. We propose Thinking Intervention, a novel paradigm designed to explicitly guide the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by strategically inserting or revising specific thinking tokens. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple tasks, including instruction following on IFEval, instruction hierarchy on SEP, and safety alignment on XSTest and SORRY-Bench. Our results demonstrate that Thinking Intervention significantly outperforms baseline prompting approaches, achieving up to 6.7% accuracy gains in instruction-following scenarios, 15.4% improvements in reasoning about instruction hierarchies, and a 40.0% increase in refusal rates for unsafe prompts using open-source DeepSeek R1 models. Overall, our work opens a promising new research avenue for controlling reasoning LLMs.

The detection of telecom fraud faces significant challenges due to the lack of high-quality multimodal training data that integrates audio signals with reasoning-oriented textual analysis. To address this gap, we present TeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset specifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is constructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample generation using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call recordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency through text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via large language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR outputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that simulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and fraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed speech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The dataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection, fraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a standardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances from the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on telecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while open-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset expansion. This work establishes a foundational framework for multimodal anti-fraud research while addressing critical challenges in data privacy and scenario diversity. The project will be released at https://github.com/JimmyMa99/TeleAntiFraud.

Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) has made significant strides over the past two decades. However, as problem scales and complexities increase, traditional EMO algorithms face substantial performance limitations due to insufficient parallelism and scalability. While most work has focused on algorithm design to address these challenges, little attention has been given to hardware acceleration, thereby leaving a clear gap between EMO algorithms and advanced computing devices, such as GPUs. To bridge the gap, we propose to parallelize EMO algorithms on GPUs via the tensorization methodology. By employing tensorization, the data structures and operations of EMO algorithms are transformed into concise tensor representations, which seamlessly enables automatic utilization of GPU computing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to three representative EMO algorithms: NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and HypE. To comprehensively assess our methodology, we introduce a multiobjective robot control benchmark using a GPU-accelerated physics engine. Our experiments show that the tensorized EMO algorithms achieve speedups of up to 1113x compared to their CPU-based counterparts, while maintaining solution quality and effectively scaling population sizes to hundreds of thousands. Furthermore, the tensorized EMO algorithms efficiently tackle complex multiobjective robot control tasks, producing high-quality solutions with diverse behaviors.
