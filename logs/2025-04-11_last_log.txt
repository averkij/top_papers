Text:"MonoPlace3D: Learning 3D-Aware Object Placement for 3D Monocular Detection Rishubh Parihar* Srinjay Sarkar Sarthak Vora Jogendra Nath Kundu R. Venkatesh Babu5 2 0 2 0 1 ] . [ 2 1 0 8 6 0 . 4 0 5 2 : r aCurrent monocular 3D detectors are held back by the limited diversity and scale of real-world datasets. While data augmentation certainly helps, its particularly difficult to generate realistic scene-aware augmented data for outdoor settings. Most current approaches to synthetic data generation focus on realistic object appearance through improved rendering techniques. However, we show that where and how objects are positioned is just as crucial for training effective 3D monocular detectors. The key obstacle lies in automatically determining realistic object placement parameters - including position, dimensions, and directional alignment when introducing synthetic objects into actual scenes. To address this, we introduce MonoPlace3D, novel system that considers the 3D scene content to create realistic augmentations. Specifically, given background scene, MonoPlace3D learns distribution over plausible 3D bounding boxes. Subsequently, we render realistic objects and place them according to the locations sampled from the learned distribution. Our comprehensive evaluation on two standard datasets KITTI and NuScenes, demonstrates that MonoPlace3D significantly improves the accuracy of multiple existing monocular 3D detectors while being highly data efficient. project page 1. Introduction Monocular 3D object detection has rapidly progressed recently, enabling its use in autonomous navigation and robotics [18, 32]. However, the performance of 3D detectors relies heavily on the quantity and quality of the training dataset. Given the considerable effort and time required to curate extensive, real-world 3D-annotated datasets, specialized data augmentation for 3D object detection has emerged as promising direction. However designing realistic augmentations for 3D tasks, is non-trivial, as the generated augmentations must adhere to the physical constraints of the real world, such as maintaining 3D geometric consistency and handling collisions. *equal contribution Figure 1. a) We compare augmentations from our learned placement with heuristic-based placements from Lift3D [22]. In our augmentations, vehicles follow the lane orientations and are placed appropriately. b) These realistic augmentations significantly improve the 3D detection performance (KITTI [6] val set, (easy)). Notably, we achieve detection performance comparable to that of the fully labeled dataset using only 50% of the dataset. Existing techniques [14, 25] for 3D augmentation use relatively simple heuristics for placing synthetic objects in an input scene. For instance, in the context of road scenes, recent approach [22] generates realistic cars and places them on the segmented road region. However, such heuristics result in highly unnatural scene augmentations  (Fig. 1)  , resulting in marginal improvement in 3D detection performance. In this work, we ask the following two crucial questions: (1) What key factors are essential for generating realistic augmentations to improve monocular 3D object detection?, and (2) How can these factors be integrated to generate effective scene-aware augmentations? For the first question, we discover two critical factors responsible for generating effective 3D augmentations: 1. Object Placement: Plausible placement of augmented objects, with appropriate object placement (location, scale, and orientation), is essential for rendering realistic scene augmentations. For instance, in road scenes, car should be placed on the road, be of appropriate size based on the distance from the camera, and follow the lane orientation. Augmentations that respect such physical constraints generalize better to real scenes by faithfully modelling the true distribution of the vehicles in the real world. To give an example of how such an augmentation looks, we compare our proposed augmentation approach against heuristicbased placement from Lift3D [22] in Fig. 1. Given the same rendering, our generation looks much more plausible regarding car placement and orientation compared to the baseline approach. Notably, when used for object detection training, our approach leads to significantly greater performance improvement, making the detector not only performant, but also highly data efficient (refer Fig. 1c) 2. Object Appearance: For 3D augmentation, it is desired that the generated objects exhibit realism and seamlessly integrate with the background to preserve visual consistency. This, in turn, minimizes the domain disparity between real and augmented data. Existing augmentation methods for 3D detection [14, 22, 25] primarily focus on the object appearance. This limits their ability to exploit the full potential of the data augmentations for 3D detection. To address both these factors, we propose MonoPlace3D, novel scene-aware augmentation method that generates effective 3D augmentations, as shown in Fig. 1. For plausible object placement, we train 3D Scene-Aware Placement Network (SA-PlaceNet), which maps given scene image to distribution of plausible 3D bounding boxes. It learns realistic object placements that adhere to the physical rules of road scenes, facilitating sampling of diverse and plausible 3D bounding boxes (see Fig. 1a). For training this network, we consider existing 3D detection datasets, which typically contain only limited number of objects per scene, resulting in sparse training signal. Therefore, to enable dense placement prediction, we introduce novel modules based on (1) geometric augmentations of 3D boxes, along with (2) modeling of continuous distribution of 3D boxes. For realistic object appearance, we propose rendering pipeline that leverages synthetic 3D assets and an imageto-image translation model. We translate the synthetic renderings into realistic version using ControlNet [53](see Fig. 1b) and blend them with the background to get final augmentations. This allows us to utilize amateur-quality 3D assets and transform them into diverse, highly realistic car renderings that resemble real-world scenes. Our two-stage augmentation approach is highly effective and modular, allowing seamless integration with advancements in placement and rendering for enhancing 3D object detection datasets. Using our augmentation method on popular 3D detection datasets led to significant improvements over the "

"Current monocular 3D detectors are held back by the limited diversity and scale of real-world datasets. While data augmentation certainly helps, it's particularly difficult to generate realistic scene-aware augmented data for outdoor settings. Most current approaches to synthetic data generation focus on realistic object appearance through improved rendering techniques. However, we show that where and how objects are positioned is just as crucial for training effective 3D monocular detectors. The key obstacle lies in automatically determining realistic object placement parameters - including position, dimensions, and directional alignment when introducing synthetic objects into actual scenes. To address this, we introduce MonoPlace3D, a novel system that considers the 3D scene content to create realistic augmentations. Specifically, given a background scene, MonoPlace3D learns a distribution over plausible 3D bounding boxes. Subsequently, we render realistic objects and place them according to the locations sampled from the learned distribution. Our comprehensive evaluation on two standard datasets KITTI and NuScenes, demonstrates that MonoPlace3D significantly improves the accuracy of multiple existing monocular 3D detectors while being highly data efficient."

Existing approaches for controlling text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, do not allow for explicit 3D object-centric control, such as precise control of object orientation. In this work, we address the problem of multi-object orientation control in text-to-image diffusion models. This enables the generation of diverse multi-object scenes with precise orientation control for each object. The key idea is to condition the diffusion model with a set of orientation-aware compass tokens, one for each object, along with text tokens. A light-weight encoder network predicts these compass tokens taking object orientation as the input. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset of procedurally generated scenes, each containing one or two 3D assets on a plain background. However, direct training this framework results in poor orientation control as well as leads to entanglement among objects. To mitigate this, we intervene in the generation process and constrain the cross-attention maps of each compass token to its corresponding object regions. The trained model is able to achieve precise orientation control for a) complex objects not seen during training and b) multi-object scenes with more than two objects, indicating strong generalization capabilities. Further, when combined with personalization methods, our method precisely controls the orientation of the new object in diverse contexts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art orientation control and text alignment, quantified with extensive evaluations and a user study.
