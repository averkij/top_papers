Global contextual information and local detail features are essential for haze removal tasks. Deep learning models perform well on small, low-resolution images, but they encounter difficulties with large, high-resolution ones due to GPU memory limitations. As a compromise, they often resort to image slicing or downsampling. The former diminishes global information, while the latter discards high-frequency details. To address these challenges, we propose DehazeXL, a haze removal method that effectively balances global context and local feature extraction, enabling end-to-end modeling of large images on mainstream GPU hardware. Additionally, to evaluate the efficiency of global context utilization in haze removal performance, we design a visual attribution method tailored to the characteristics of haze removal tasks. Finally, recognizing the lack of benchmark datasets for haze removal in large images, we have developed an ultra-high-resolution haze removal dataset (8KDehaze) to support model training and testing. It includes 10000 pairs of clear and hazy remote sensing images, each sized at 8192 times 8192 pixels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DehazeXL can infer images up to 10240 times 10240 pixels with only 21 GB of memory, achieving state-of-the-art results among all evaluated methods. The source code and experimental dataset are available at https://github.com/CastleChen339/DehazeXL.

"Global contextual information and local detail features are essential for haze removal tasks. Deep learning models perform well on small, low-resolution images, but they encounter difficulties with large, high-resolution ones due to GPU memory limitations. As a compromise, they often resort to image slicing or downsampling. The former diminishes global information, while the latter discards high-frequency details. To address these challenges, we propose DehazeXL, a haze removal method that effectively balances global context and local feature extraction, enabling end-to-end modeling of large images on mainstream GPU hardware. Additionally, to evaluate the efficiency of global context utilization in haze removal performance, we design a visual attribution method tailored to the characteristics of haze removal tasks. Finally, recognizing the lack of benchmark datasets for haze removal in large images, we have developed an ultra-high-resolution haze removal dataset (8KDehaze) to support model training and testing. It includes 10000 pairs of clear and hazy remote sensing images, each sized at 8192 times 8192 pixels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DehazeXL can infer images up to 10240 times 10240 pixels with only 21 GB of memory, achieving state-of-the-art results among all evaluated methods. The source code and experimental dataset are available at https://github.com/CastleChen339/DehazeXL."

Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated the effectiveness of scaling test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities in multiple tasks. However, LRMs typically suffer from "overthinking" problems, where models generate significantly redundant reasoning steps while bringing limited performance gains. Existing work relies on fine-tuning to mitigate overthinking, which requires additional data, unconventional training setups, risky safety misalignment, and poor generalization.   Through empirical analysis, we reveal an important characteristic of LRM behaviors that placing external CoTs generated by smaller models between the thinking token (<think> and </think>) can effectively manipulate the model to generate fewer thoughts. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet efficient pipeline, ThoughtMani, to enable LRMs to bypass unnecessary intermediate steps and reduce computational costs significantly. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the utility and efficiency of ThoughtMani. For instance, when applied to QwQ-32B on the LiveBench/Code dataset, ThoughtMani keeps the original performance and reduces output token counts by approximately 30%, with little overhead from the CoT generator. Furthermore, we find that ThoughtMani enhances safety alignment by an average of 10%. Since model vendors typically serve models of different sizes simultaneously, ThoughtMani provides an effective way to construct more efficient and accessible LRMs for real-world applications.
