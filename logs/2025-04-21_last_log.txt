Inspired by the human cognitive phenomenon of attentional biasthe natural tendency to prioritize certain events or stimuliwe reconceptualize neural architectures, including Transformers, Titans, and modern linear recurrent neural networks as associative memory modules that learn mapping of keys and values using an internal objective, referred to as attentional bias. Surprisingly, we observed that most existing sequence models leverage either (1) dot-product similarity, or (2) ‚Ñì2 regression objectives as their attentional bias. Going beyond these objectives, we present set of alternative attentional bias configurations along with their effective approximations to stabilize their training procedure. We then reinterpret forgetting mechanisms in modern deep learning architectures as form of retention regularization, providing novel set of forget gates for sequence models. Building upon these insights, we present Miras, general framework to design deep learning architectures based on four choices of: (i) associative memory architecture, (ii) attentional bias objective, (iii) retention gate, and (iv) memory learning algorithm.

It introduces the concept of attentional bias, which helps models prioritize important information, and critiques existing methods that rely on simple similarity measures. The authors propose a framework called Miras, which allows for flexible design choices in memory architecture and training objectives. They also present new models that outperform traditional approaches in specific tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of their innovative strategies.', title='Revolutionizing Neural Architectures with Attentional Bias'))
