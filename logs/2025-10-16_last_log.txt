Text:"2025-10-16 Attention Illuminates LLM Reasoning: The Preplan-and-Anchor Rhythm Enables Fine-Grained Policy Optimization Yang Li12, Zhichen Dong12, Yuhan Sun1, Weixun Wang2, Shaopan Xiong2, Yijia Luo2, Jiashun Liu2, Han Lu12, Jiamang Wang2, Wenbo Su2, Bo Zheng2, Junchi Yan1 1Shanghai Jiao Tong University 2Alibaba Group Abstract The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This work positions attention as privileged substrate that renders the internal logic of LLMs legible, not merely as byproduct of computation, but as mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that locally focused heads produce sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics: 1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward attention within clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which quantifies tokens global importance as the average attention it receives from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal recurring preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs long-range contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately followed by or coincides with semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with the models intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization into a"

Text:"5 2 0 2 3 1 ] . [ 1 1 2 9 0 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r FG-CLIP 2: BILINGUAL FINE-GRAINED VISIONLANGUAGE ALIGNMENT MODEL Chunyu Xie* Bin Wang*, Fanjing Kong, Jincheng Li, Dawei Liang, Ji Ao, Dawei Leng, Yuhui YinCode&Model&Dataset: https://360cvgroup.github.io/FG-CLIPFine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between visual content and linguistic descriptions, capability that remains limited in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges, we introduce FG-CLIP 2, bilingual vision-language model designed to advance fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish semantically similar captions. Trained on carefully curated mixture of large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present new benchmark for Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving stateof-the-art results in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.Vision-language alignment models (Tschannen et al., 2025; Chuang et al., 2025) have undergone rapid evolution in recent years, driven by pioneering works such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), which introduced large-scale contrastive pre-training on image-text pairs and demonstrated remarkable success in learning joint multimodal representations. These models excel at global alignment tasks such as zero-shot image classification and image-text retrieval, forming the foundation for wide range of multimodal understanding systems (Zhu et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025a; Li et al., 2025a; Wu et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025b). Their ability to align visual and linguistic concepts without explicit supervision has enabled strong generalization to diverse scenarios, including visual question answering (Lu et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025a), image captioning (Bai et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025b), and content-based retrieval (Zhang et al., 2024a; Wei et al., 2024). However, their performance often degrades on fine-grained understanding tasks that require discriminating between similar object attributes, spatial configurations, or semantic distinctions. Such tasks demand precise alignment at both visual and linguistic levels: visually, they involve recognizing objects, attributes, and their spatial arrangements; linguistically, they require distinguishing between semantically similar expressions. This performance gap stems from reliance on coarse-grained image-text pairs during training, which encourages thematic alignment while failing to capture the fine-grained correspondences essential for robust visual grounding or attribute recognition. *Equal contribution. E-mail: xiechunyu@360.cn, wangbin10@360.cn Corresponding Author. E-mail: lengdawei@360.cn Several recent works have sought to address these limitations. Approaches such as FineCLIP (Jing et al., 2024) and LongCLIP (Zhang et al., 2024a) improve fine-grained understanding by incorporating region-level signals or supporting longer textual inputs. FG-CLIP (Xie et al., 2025) significantly advances the state of fine-grained modeling through large-scale data curation and attribute-based hard negative sampling. On the language side, Chinese-CLIP (Yang et al., 2022) and R2D2 (Xie et al., 2023) have laid the groundwork for Chinese vision-language alignment, yet they primarily focus on short-caption retrieval and lack support for fine-grained or region-level tasks. The development of fine-grained capabilities has thus remained largely confined to English, whereas Chinese models operate at coarser semantic level. No existing framework unifies these directions, and there is notable absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating fine-grained understanding in Chinese, which hinders systematic progress in bilingual multimodal research. To address these challenges, we propose FG-CLIP 2, unified framework for bilingual fine-grained vision-language alignment. Our training strategy employs two-stage paradigm to progressively refine model capabilities. In the first stage, we perform initial global alignment with both short and long textual descriptions to capture coarse and detailed semantic content at the early phase of training. In the second stage, we incorporate fine-grained learning objectives that improve regional alignment, discriminative capability, and cross-modal ranking performance. To further refine the models ability to distinguish similar region-level descriptions, we propose the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss, which learns from filtered hard negatives among high-similarity text pairs. FG-CLIP 2 is trained on large-scale, high-quality bilingual datasets with careful curation, enabling strong performance in both English and Chinese across diverse fine-grained vision-language tasks. We further contribute new benchmark suite to advance evaluation in Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring challenging tasks such as long caption image-text retrieval and bounding box classification in Chinese that go beyond conventional short-text retrieval and assess fine-grained comprehension more rigorously. Extensive experiments show that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing models on 29 datasets across 8 vision-language tasks in both Chinese and English, demonstrating powerful bilingual fine-grained vision-language alignment capability. To support future research and real-world deployment, our model, code and benchmark will be made publicly available.Vision-language alignment models trained on large-scale data, such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), EVA-CLIP (Sun et al., 2023), SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023), MetaCLIP (Xu et al., 2024) and DFN (Fang et al., 2024) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities but primarily focus on global semantic alignment and are often trained on English-only corpo"

Emulating this holistic capability represents grand challenge and core objective in the pursuit of more general artificial intelligence. The recent ascendancy of Large Language Models (LLMs) has served as powerful catalyst, paving the way for unified models that can understand and generate content across these diverse data streams. Significant progress has been made in systems that jointly process text, images, video, and even speech within single architecture [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Nevertheless, critical imbalance persists in the treatment of the auditory domain. While speech has been primary focus of integration [5], [6], musica domain of comparable complexity and cultural richnessremains largely siloed and excluded from these unified frameworks. This fundamental omission not only curtails the ambition of universal audio synthesis but also stands as significant impediment to developing AI with truly comprehensive multimodal intelligence. The primary obstacle to unifying speech and music generation stems from two fundamental challenges. The first is Zhenyu Liu, Yunxin Li, Xuanyu Zhang, Qixun Teng, Shenyuan Jiang, Xinyu Chen, Haoyuan Shi, Jinchao Li, Qi Wang, Baotian Hu and Min Zhang are with the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China.

Baotian Hu is the corresponding author. (e-mail: hubaotian@hit.edu.cn) task conflict, arising from the divergent objectives of speech and music generation. The former is primarily concerned with semantic intelligibility and speaker identity, whereas the latter focuses on capturing complex structures like harmony and rhythm. This divergence creates conflicting optimization pressures within shared model, where progress on one task can impede the other. Recently, the MoE paradigm has emerged as promising architecture for mitigating conflicts of multimodal understanding [7], [8], [4]. Despite these advances, its application and further optimization for unified audio generation remain largely unexplored. Beyond task conflict, another major hurdle is data imbalance. Highquality, large-scale speech corpora are far more abundant than their musical counterparts. The detrimental effects of this disparity are evident in prior work [9]. Consequently, naive joint training approach often allows the data-rich speech task to dominate the learning process, resulting in substantial degradation in musical quality. Our preliminary experiments empirically confirm this degradation (Figure 1), showing that jointly trained model performs significantly worse than specialized models, with the performance drop being particularly severe for the data-scarce music task. Therefore, the central scientific question we address is: how to overcome both task conflict and data imbalance, enabling shared model to master speech and music generation synergistically? Our approach addresses these challenges at both the architectural and training curriculum levels. Architecturally, we propose UniMoE-Audio, which leverages novel DynamicCapacity MoE for mitigating task conflict. Instead of directly applying the conventional MoE, we provide two key archi5 2 0 2 5 1 ] .

InteractiveOmni is a unified omni-modal large language model for audio-visual multi-turn interactions, offering comprehensive understanding and speech generation capabilities with efficient parameter usage.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience, particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

CVD-STORM, a cross-view video diffusion model with a spatial-temporal reconstruction VAE, enhances video generation quality and provides depth estimation for dynamic scenes.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene understanding.

Attention mechanisms in LLMs are analyzed to reveal reasoning patterns, leading to novel RL strategies that improve performance by focusing on critical tokens.  					AI-generated summary 				 The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics: 1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.

"Attention mechanisms in LLMs are analyzed to reveal reasoning patterns, leading to novel RL strategies that improve performance by focusing on critical tokens.  					AI-generated summary 				 The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics: 1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning."

A new dataset and pipeline for data curation improve the performance of fully open multimodal large language models, achieving state-of-the-art results competitive with semi-open models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness; and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model, enhances fine-grained alignment for English and Chinese through rich supervision and a new TIC loss, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets and tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges, we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.

State-of-the-art Visual-Language-Action models show high benchmark scores but are brittle to various perturbations, particularly in camera viewpoints and robot initial states, and often ignore language instructions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout, camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

Parallel decoding in diffusion LLMs degrades generation quality due to ignored token dependencies, highlighting the need for new decoding methods and benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 While most autoregressive LLMs are constrained to one-by-one decoding, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have attracted growing interest for their potential to dramatically accelerate inference through parallel decoding. Despite this promise, the conditional independence assumption in dLLMs causes parallel decoding to ignore token dependencies, inevitably degrading generation quality when these dependencies are strong. However, existing works largely overlook these inherent challenges, and evaluations on standard benchmarks (e.g., math and coding) are not sufficient to capture the quality degradation caused by parallel decoding. To address this gap, we first provide an information-theoretic analysis of parallel decoding. We then conduct case studies on analytically tractable synthetic list operations from both data distribution and decoding strategy perspectives, offering quantitative insights that highlight the fundamental limitations of parallel decoding. Building on these insights, we propose ParallelBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for dLLMs, featuring realistic tasks that are trivial for humans and autoregressive LLMs yet exceptionally challenging for dLLMs under parallel decoding. Using ParallelBench, we systematically analyze both dLLMs and autoregressive LLMs, revealing that: (i) dLLMs under parallel decoding can suffer dramatic quality degradation in real-world scenarios, and (ii) current parallel decoding strategies struggle to adapt their degree of parallelism based on task difficulty, thus failing to achieve meaningful speedup without compromising quality. Our findings underscore the pressing need for innovative decoding methods that can overcome the current speed-quality trade-off. We release our benchmark to help accelerate the development of truly efficient dLLMs.

NOSA, a trainable sparse attention framework, enhances decoding throughput by enabling efficient KV cache offloading without compromising performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing, significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced, which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput, especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention baseline (InfLLM-V2).

End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning (IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines, along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

MTSQL-R1, an agentic training framework, improves multi-turn Text-to-SQL by treating it as an MDP with iterative propose-execute-verify-refine cycles, enhancing coherence and execution.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -> verify -> refine cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models, logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review to contribute to community research.

"MTSQL-R1, an agentic training framework, improves multi-turn Text-to-SQL by treating it as an MDP with iterative propose-execute-verify-refine cycles, enhancing coherence and execution.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -> verify -> refine cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models, logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review to contribute to community research."

UniMoE-Audio, a unified speech and music generation model using a Dynamic-Capacity Mixture-of-Experts framework, addresses data imbalance and task conflicts, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enhanced cross-domain synergy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in unified multimodal models indicate a clear trend towards comprehensive content generation. However, the auditory domain remains a significant challenge, with music and speech often developed in isolation, hindering progress towards universal audio synthesis. This separation stems from inherent task conflicts and severe data imbalances, which impede the development of a truly unified audio generation model. To address this challenge, we propose UniMoE-Audio, a unified speech and music generation model within a novel Dynamic-Capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework. Architecturally, UniMoE-Audio introduces a Top-P routing strategy for dynamic expert number allocation, and a hybrid expert design comprising routed experts for domain-specific knowledge, shared experts for domain-agnostic features, and null experts for adaptive computation skipping. To tackle data imbalance, we introduce a three-stage training curriculum: 1) Independent Specialist Training leverages original datasets to instill domain-specific knowledge into each "proto-expert" without interference; 2) MoE Integration and Warmup incorporates these specialists into the UniMoE-Audio architecture, warming up the gate module and shared expert using a subset of balanced dataset; and 3) Synergistic Joint Training trains the entire model end-to-end on the fully balanced dataset, fostering enhanced cross-domain synergy. Extensive experiments show that UniMoE-Audio not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on major speech and music generation benchmarks, but also demonstrates superior synergistic learning, mitigating the performance degradation typically seen in naive joint training. Our findings highlight the substantial potential of specialized MoE architecture and curated training strategies in advancing the field of universal audio generation.
