[ 1 7 7 9 0 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r aModel merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning trajectory. These dynamics provide principled guide for navigating the performancecost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that strategically interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies. Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers practical framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities. Code is available at Github.(LLMs), language models Large such as Qwen3 (Yang et al., 2025), OpenAI o1 (Jaech et al., 2024), and Deepseek R1 (Guo et al., 2025), have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). Their remarkable success in complex tasks is largely attributed to emergent reasoning capabilities, which benefit from scaled chain-of-thoughts (Wei et al., 2022) during test time (Snell et al., 2024). However, longer CoT also introduces significant trade-offs such as over-thinking (Chen et al., 2024) and high latency issues (Sui et al., 2025). Consequently, how to achieve efficient reasoning without compromising performance remains critical challenge. To address this challenge, model merging has emerged as compelling solution (Yang et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2025c) The core idea is to merge the weights of two specialized models, including Figure 1: The performance dynamics for the model interpolation between Instruct and Thinking models. Think #R denotes the ratio of samples with </think> token in responses. Token #N denotes the number of tokens in responses. Thinking model adept at long-CoT reasoning and an Instruct model optimized for short, direct answers, and thus create hybrid model balancing reasoning capability with token efficiency (Team et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025a). Existing merging methods can be categorized into weighted-based (Utans, 1996; Ilharco et al., 2022), subspace-based (Yadav et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024), and routingbased (Muqeeth et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2024). Most of these merging methods require the paired pretrained model, constraint not shared by the simpler method of direct model interpolation. In this paper, we revisit the model interpolation (MI) method and systemically analyze the dynamics as the interpolation coefficient λ sweeps from 0 to 1. Surprisingly, we find that the performance metrics, such as Pass@k and Mean@k, do not evolve linearly but instead follow distinct three-stage paradigm detailed in Figure 1. In stage #1, where the weights of the Instruct model are Figure 2: Performance of vanilla Instruct, Thinking, and model merging methods on AIME25, IFEval, and GPQA-Diamond. MI denotes the model interpolation and the suffix for the interpolation coefficient λ. The results indicate that MI surpasses these baselines on both efficiency and effectiveness. dominant, Pass@k and the number of output tokens increase rapidly with almost no explicit reasoning in responses. The thinking pattern, measured by the presence of token </think>, emerges in stage #2 with larger λ, with the Mean@k increasing faster than Pass@k. At stage #3, the output responses become substantially longer, yet the marginal gains in Pass@k and Mean@k diminish, corresponding to the overthinking phenomenon (Chen et al., 2024). These observations offer novel insights into the mechanics of weight interpolation and further provide principled guide for desired reasoning behaviors. We conduct extensive experiments on Qwen3 models (Yang et al., 2025), interpolating between the official Thinking and Instruct variants. As shown in Figure 2, strategically interpolated model surpasses the mainstream model merging baselines across various challenging benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning (AIME25 (AIME, 2025)), instructionfollowing (IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023)), and science reasoning (GPQA-Diamond (Rein et al., 2024)). Beyond this superior performance, our analysis provides practical framework for crafting models with desired behaviors such as adhering to specific token budget. We further conduct fine-grained ablations on model layers and modules, providing comprehensive view of how interpolation fuses reasoning capabilities. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: We systematically revisit model interpolation methods and uncover three-stage evolutionary paradigm. This framework provides principled guidance for efficient reasoning. We empirically demonstrate that simple yet strategically interpolated model can surpass sophisticated merging baselines across diverse suite of challenging benchmarks. We provide deep mechanistic insights through fine-grained ablation studies on layers, modules, and decoding strategies.2.1 Efficient Reasoning Efficient reasoning aims to reduce the output tokens while preserving reasoning capability as much as possible (Sui et al., 2025). The methods can be categorized as 1) model-based, setting short response as the optimization goal during SFT (Yu et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025) or RL (Team et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a,b), 2) decoding-based, which modifies the output paradigm such as latent reasoning (Hao et al., 2024; Butt et al., 2025) and dynamic reasoning (Sun et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025), and 3) prompts-based, refining the input prompts for enable concise and efficient reasoning (Xu et al., 2025; Aytes et al., 2025). We refer the reader to Sui et al. (2025) for comprehensive survey. In this paper, we focus on the training-free model interpolation for efficient thinking. 2.2 Model Merging Model merging methods merge the parameters of multiple separate models with different capabilities, and are widely applied for continual learning (Marczak et al., 2024), multi-task learning (Yang et al., 2023), and model attack (Gangwal and Sharma, 2025). The key is to merge the weights from different models following the same structure. One intuitive idea is to average the weights (Utans, 1996), while the task arithmetic framework extends the idea to t"

[ 1 8 7 7 3 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r 2025-10InternVLA-M1: Spatially Guided Vision-Language-Action Framework for Generalist Robot Policy Intern Robotics, Shanghai AI Laboratory We introduce InternVLA-M1, unified framework for spatial grounding and robot control that advances instructionfollowing robots toward scalable, general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided vision-languageaction training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs two-stage pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning data to determine where to act by aligning instructions with visual, embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training to decide how to act by generating embodiment-aware actions through plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box, point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes, enabling 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided training as unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

However, existing approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Ineffective group collaboration modeling, as they rely on pairwise edge representations in graph structures, limiting their ability to capture relationships among multiple agents; and (ii) Limited task-adaptiveness in communication topology design, leading to excessive communication cost for simple tasks and insufficient coordination for complex scenarios. These issues restrict the scalability and practical deployment of adaptive collaboration frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose HyperAgent, hypergraph-based framework that optimizes communication topologies and effectively captures group collaboration patterns using direct hyperedge representations. Unlike edge-based approaches, HyperAgent uses hyperedges to link multiple agents within the same subtask and employs hypergraph convolutional layers to achieve one-step information aggregation in collaboration groups. Additionally, it incorporates variational autoencoder framework with sparsity regularization to dynamically adjust hypergraph topologies based on task complexity. Experiments highlight the superiori"

Existing temporal attribution methods struggle to accurately diagnose root causes, particularly when errors propagate across multiple agents. Attempts to automate failure attribution by analyzing action sequences remain ineffective due to their inability to account for information dependencies that span agents. This paper identifies two core challenges: (i) distinguishing symptoms from root causes in multi-agent error propagation, and (ii) tracing information dependencies beyond temporal order. To address these issues, we introduce GraphTracer, framework that redefines failure attribution through information flow analysis. GraphTracer constructs Information Dependency Graphs (IDGs) to explicitly capture how agents reference and build on prior outputs. It localizes root causes by tracing through these dependency structures instead of relying on temporal sequences. GraphTracer also uses graph-aware synthetic data generation to target critical nodes, creating realistic failure scenarios. Evaluations on the Who&When benchmark and integration into production systems demonstrate that GraphTracer-8B achieves up to"

Trace Anything, a neural network, predicts video trajectories in a single pass, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating efficiency and emergent abilities like motion forecasting.  					AI-generated summary 				 Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling, understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video, the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

"Trace Anything, a neural network, predicts video trajectories in a single pass, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating efficiency and emergent abilities like motion forecasting.  					AI-generated summary 				 Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling, understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video, the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

A novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model uses MLLMs to enhance representation learning by identifying diverse, high-quality hard negatives and improving discriminative capacity through soft semantic matching scores.  					AI-generated summary 				 Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks. Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model. Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

PhysMaster enhances video generation by integrating physical knowledge through PhysEncoder, using reinforcement learning and Direct Preference Optimization to improve physics-awareness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation, proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware video generation and broader applications.

Generative Universal Verifier enhances multimodal reasoning by providing reliable visual verification through ViVerBench, OmniVerifier-7B, and OmniVerifier-TTS, improving generation and refinement capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process. This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3). Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios. Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7), and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods, such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

"Generative Universal Verifier enhances multimodal reasoning by providing reliable visual verification through ViVerBench, OmniVerifier-7B, and OmniVerifier-TTS, improving generation and refinement capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.

Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7), and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods, such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and controllable next-generation reasoning systems."

FlashWorld generates 3D scenes from single images or text prompts quickly and with high quality by combining MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100times faster than previous works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model, which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our method.

Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.

A unified framework for spatial grounding and robot control, InternVLA-M1, enhances instruction-following robots through spatially guided vision-language-action training, achieving significant improvements across various tasks and simulations.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable, general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual, embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box, point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes, enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots. Code and models are available at https://github.com/InternRobotics/InternVLA-M1.

"A unified framework for spatial grounding and robot control, InternVLA-M1, enhances instruction-following robots through spatially guided vision-language-action training, achieving significant improvements across various tasks and simulations.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable, general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual, embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box, point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes, enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots. Code and models are available at https://github.com/InternRobotics/InternVLA-M1."

Hard2Verify, a human-annotated benchmark, evaluates step-level verifiers for LLM-based mathematical reasoning systems, highlighting the challenges and performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging, open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated, step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor. Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation dynamics.

Participants in the CPDC 2025 used lightweight prompting and fine-tuned large models to achieve high rankings in task-oriented and context-aware dialogue challenges.

In this paper, we (Tu_Character_lab) report our participation in the Commonsense Persona-Grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025 Round 2, which eval- uates agents across three tracks: task-oriented dialogue, context-aware dialogue, and their integration. Our approach combines two complementary strategies: (i) lightweight prompting techniques in the API track, including a Deflanderization prompting method to suppress excessive role-play and improve task fidelity, and (ii) fine-tuned large models in the GPU track, leveraging Qwen3-14B with supervisedfinetuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA).

Direct Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD) accelerates large language model inference by using only late layers for token generation, achieving significant speedup with minimal performance loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification. Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.

HyperAgent, a hypergraph-based framework, optimizes communication topologies and captures group collaboration patterns, improving performance and efficiency in multi-agent systems.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large language model-powered multi-agent systems have demonstrated remarkable collective intelligence through effective communication. However, existing approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Ineffective group collaboration modeling, as they rely on pairwise edge representations in graph structures, limiting their ability to capture relationships among multiple agents; and (ii) Limited task-adaptiveness in communication topology design, leading to excessive communication cost for simple tasks and insufficient coordination for complex scenarios. These issues restrict the scalability and practical deployment of adaptive collaboration frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose HyperAgent, a hypergraph-based framework that optimizes communication topologies and effectively captures group collaboration patterns using direct hyperedge representations. Unlike edge-based approaches, HyperAgent uses hyperedges to link multiple agents within the same subtask and employs hypergraph convolutional layers to achieve one-step information aggregation in collaboration groups. Additionally, it incorporates a variational autoencoder framework with sparsity regularization to dynamically adjust hypergraph topologies based on task complexity. Experiments highlight the superiority of HyperAgent in both performance and efficiency. For instance, on GSM8K, HyperAgent achieves 95.07\% accuracy while reducing token consumption by 25.33\%, demonstrating the potential of hypergraph-based optimization for multi-agent communication.

GraphTracer addresses multi-agent system failure attribution by constructing Information Dependency Graphs to trace information flow and improve debugging accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models excel at complex tasks through coordinated collaboration, yet they face high failure rates in multi-turn deep search scenarios. Existing temporal attribution methods struggle to accurately diagnose root causes, particularly when errors propagate across multiple agents. Attempts to automate failure attribution by analyzing action sequences remain ineffective due to their inability to account for information dependencies that span agents. This paper identifies two core challenges: (i) distinguishing symptoms from root causes in multi-agent error propagation, and (ii) tracing information dependencies beyond temporal order. To address these issues, we introduce GraphTracer, a framework that redefines failure attribution through information flow analysis. GraphTracer constructs Information Dependency Graphs (IDGs) to explicitly capture how agents reference and build on prior outputs. It localizes root causes by tracing through these dependency structures instead of relying on temporal sequences. GraphTracer also uses graph-aware synthetic data generation to target critical nodes, creating realistic failure scenarios. Evaluations on the Who\&When benchmark and integration into production systems demonstrate that GraphTracer-8B achieves up to 18.18\% higher attribution accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and enables 4.8\% to 14.2\% performance improvements in deployed multi-agent frameworks, establishing a robust solution for multi-agent system debugging.

GraphTracer constructs Information Dependency Graphs (IDGs) to explicitly capture how agents reference and build on prior outputs. It localizes root causes by tracing through these dependency structures instead of relying on temporal sequences. GraphTracer also uses graph-aware synthetic data generation to target critical nodes, creating realistic failure scenarios. Evaluations on the Who\&When benchmark and integration into production systems demonstrate that GraphTracer-8B achieves up to 18.18\% higher attribution accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and enables 4.8\% to 14.2\% performance improvements in deployed multi-agent frameworks, establishing a robust solution for multi-agent system debugging."
