[ 1 2 8 2 3 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r AbstractThis study introduces Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method (MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to reconstruct corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive learning, resulting in generalized representation suited for restoration tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen degradation types and levels.

INTRODUCTIONa single model to transform low-quality (LQ) images affected by variable, mixed, and real-world degradation into high-quality (HQ) images. In recent work, deep learningbased methods [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] have demonstrated superior performance and efficiency in solving universal image restoration compared to traditional techniques [7, 8]. The prevalent approaches employ degradation representations of LQ images as discriminative prompts for universal image restoration tasks, utilizing elements such as gradients [9], frequency [10], supplementary parameters [2], and features JiaKui Hu, Zhengjian Yao and Yanye Lu are with Institute of Medical Technology, Peking University Health Science Center, Peking University, Beijing, China, and also with Biomedical Engineering Department, College of Future Technology, Peking University, Beijing, China, and also with National Biomedical Imaging Center, Peking University, Beijing, China.

These degradation representations subsequently function as prompts for base restoration models, which are either fine-tuned or specifically trained for universal image restoration. Despite achieving high performance through the implementation of precise and effective prompts, these methods do not exploit the latent prior information inherent within the restoration models. Pre-training methods [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] are adept at exploiting the latent prior information inherent within the restoration models themselves. They can activate latent discriminant information within neural networks, thereby facilitating the acquisition of universal representations and rendering the pre-trained model suitable for downstream tasks. Contrastive learning [20, 21] discovers representations by maximizing agreement across multiple augmented views of the same sample using contrastive loss [22], thus obtaining features with fine-grained discriminant information [17]. Masked Image Modeling (MIM) [18, 19, 23] extends BERTs [12] success from language to vision transformers and CNNs. MIM introduces challenging image reconstruction task through substantially high mask ratio, which requires the model to uncover the intrinsic distribution of images. Following GPTs [13, 14] success in language generation, related methods [24] are utilized in image generation. PURE [25] also successfully used pre-trained autoregressive MLLM to adapt to real-world super-resolution. However, pre-training in image restoration [26, 27, 28] is mainly confined to single-task applications or requires carefully designed fine-tuning methods. JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 2 This suggests that current approaches do not fully arouse the universal representations provided by extensive pre-training. It is imperative to develop pre-training framework for restoration models that can handle universal restoration tasks. In this paper, we assert that the ability for degradation classification constitutes frequently overlooked, yet salient, in restoration models. We discriminative feature inherent validate the effectiveness and robustness of neural networks in this capability. First, we examine the degradation classification capabilities of the classical [29, 30, 31] and all-in-one [2] image restoration architectures. Models with random initialization possess preliminary aptitude for degradation classification, which is subsequently refined through all-in-one restoration training, thus enabling better identification of previously unobserved degradation types. Further investigation reveals that this ability remains intact even when images are randomly masked. This observation indicates that image distribution learning based on masked modeling and degradation distribution learning based on degradation classification can coexist. Drawing upon this finding, we leverage this potential during the pre-training for universal image restoration tasks. By integrating degradation classification, restoration"

A Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method enhances image restoration by using degradation type classification and image reconstruction, improving performance across CNNs and Transformers.  					AI-generated summary 				 This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method (MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19 degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MaskDCPT.

"A Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method enhances image restoration by using degradation type classification and image reconstruction, improving performance across CNNs and Transformers.  					AI-generated summary 				 This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method (MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19 degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MaskDCPT."
