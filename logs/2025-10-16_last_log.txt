Text:"5 2 0 2 3 1 ] . [ 1 3 5 6 1 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r aMATH-BEYOND: BENCHMARK FOR RL TO EXPAND BEYOND THE BASE MODEL Prasanna Mayilvahanan1,2,3 Ricardo Dominguez-Olmedo2,3 Thaddäus Wiedemer1,2,3 Wieland Brendel2,3,With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, new wave of reinforcement learning (RL) methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning. However, closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals critical limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., pass@1024), many existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPOMath-17K and DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as NemotronResearch-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform poorly on MATH-B at pass@1024, showing how existing approaches fall short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We release MATH-B at https: //huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond. Figure 1: MATH-Beyond: Benchmark Construction and Difficulty. Left: Schematic of the MATH-B creation process. large set of problems from DAPO-Math-17K and DeepScaleR is first refined through quality filters to ensure answer correctness and verifiability. This is followed by evaluation against gauntlet of open-source base models ( 8B, e.g., Qwen3, Qwen2.5 (-Math), DeepSeek-R1-Distill) at pass@1024 budget to isolate problems that lie beyond their limits. The filtering yields the MATH-B suite of benchmarks: 41-problem intersection set (unsolved by all base models) for evaluating universal difficulty, and larger 181-problem union set (unsolved by at least one model) with model-specific splits for targeted analysis. This suite provides rigorous testbed to drive the development of exploration methods for RL. Right: An illustration of MATH-Bs significant difficulty compared to common test sets like AIME24. Representative open-source models like Qwen2.5 achieve near-zero pass@1024 scores on MATH-B, highlighting its difficulty. Qwen2.5 results are from Yue et al. (2025). 1University of Tübingen, 2Tübingen AI Center, 3Max-Planck-Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tübingen, 4ELLIS Institute Tübingen. Contact: prasanna.mayilvahanan@uni-tuebingen.de. Code available at https://brendel-group.github.io/math-beyond/.In the 2010s, deep reinforcement learning showcased its power through striking demonstrations of exploration and skill acquisition (Mnih et al., 2013). Atari agents, starting from random play, mastered complex games by discovering strategies unreachable to base policies, guided by exploration incentives and intrinsic rewards (Ladosz et al., 2022; Amin et al., 2021). Methods such as count-based exploration (Bellemare et al., 2016) and later Go-Explore (Ecoffet et al., 2021) drove dramatic jumps from inept play to expertise, highlighting RLs ability to uncover new capabilities. Around the same time, AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2016) and AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017) extended this promise to board games like Go, Chess, and Shogi, where self-play took agents from scratch to superhuman mastery, revealing novel strategies along the way. Against this backdrop, academic progress in reasoning-focused LLMs has taken very different path. Community-trained models often show improved accuracy on popular benchmarks such as MATH or AIME24 (Liu et al., 2025b; Song et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025; Cheng et al., 2025; Cui et al., 2025; Shao et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025b). However, these RL models typically succeed only on problems that their corresponding base models could already solve given realistic sampling budgets (Wu et al., 2025; Yue et al., 2025). This is far cry from earlier RL successes, where base policies were incapable of solving tasks outright and progress required genuine exploration and skill acquisition. This disconnect between RLs exploratory promise and its current application reflects substantial blindspot in the current open-source evaluation ecosystem. Because several open-source base models already achieve nearly 100% pass@1024 on several popular benchmarks (Yue et al., 2025), test sets in their current form are fundamentally inadequate for measuringor encouraginggenuine progress in reasoning beyond the base models reach. To address this gap, we introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), new benchmark of highschoollevel competition math problems, specifically constructed so that popular open-weight base models are unlikely to solve even with 1024 attempts. As result, progress on MATH-B necessarily requires expanding the reasoning capabilities of base models, making it an ideal target for academic research. MATH-B is constructed by filtering mathematical reasoning datasets (DAPO-Math-17K (Yu et al., 2025b) and DeepScaleR (Luo et al., 2025)), resulting in problems that are topically indistinguishable from those in standard benchmarks. While constructing the dataset, we also uncovered and addressed several non-obvious failure modes in programmatic verification, which informed our final benchmark design. To ensure correctness, all problems are additionally verified against stronger reasoning models such as GPT-5-Mini or o4-mini-high, which reliably solve them. We further confirm that leading community RL models, including Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B (Liu et al., 2025a) and DeepScaleR-1.5B, perform poorly on MATH-B, underscoring the limitations of current approaches and the need for methods that extend reasoning capabilities. In summary, our contributions are as follows: New benchmark suite: We construct MATH-Beyond, benchmark suite derived from the failures of large and diverse set of base models (pass@1024"

Hierarchical Frequency Tagging Probe (HFTP) identifies neuron-wise components in LLMs and cortical regions encoding syntactic structures, revealing differences in how LLMs and the human brain process syntax.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level or even superior language abilities, effectively modeling syntactic structures, yet the specific computational modules responsible remain unclear. A key question is whether LLM behavioral capabilities stem from mechanisms akin to those in the human brain. To address these questions, we introduce the Hierarchical Frequency Tagging Probe (HFTP), a tool that utilizes frequency-domain analysis to identify neuron-wise components of LLMs (e.g., individual Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neurons) and cortical regions (via intracranial recordings) encoding syntactic structures. Our results show that models such as GPT-2, Gemma, Gemma 2, Llama 2, Llama 3.1, and GLM-4 process syntax in analogous layers, while the human brain relies on distinct cortical regions for different syntactic levels. Representational similarity analysis reveals a stronger alignment between LLM representations and the left hemisphere of the brain (dominant in language processing). Notably, upgraded models exhibit divergent trends: Gemma 2 shows greater brain similarity than Gemma, while Llama 3.1 shows less alignment with the brain compared to Llama 2. These findings offer new insights into the interpretability of LLM behavioral improvements, raising questions about whether these advancements are driven by human-like or non-human-like mechanisms, and establish HFTP as a valuable tool bridging computational linguistics and cognitive neuroscience.

Эксперименты показали, что модели вроде GPT-2, Llama и Gemma обрабатывают синтаксис в похожих слоях, тогда как человеческий мозг использует разные кортикальные области для разных уровней синтаксиса. Анализ выявил более сильное сходство между представлениями LLM и левым полушарием мозга, которое доминирует в обработке языка.

MATH-Beyond is a benchmark designed to challenge existing reinforcement learning methods by requiring deeper reasoning capabilities beyond current model capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL) methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning. However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., pass@1024), many existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform poorly on MATH-B at pass@1024, showing how existing approaches fall short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.
