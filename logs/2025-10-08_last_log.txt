Le1* 1Google Cloud AI Research, 2Google DeepMind, 3Google Cloud AI The deployment of autonomous AI agents in sensitive domains, such as healthcare, introduces critical risks to safety, security, and privacy. These agents may deviate from user objectives, violate data handling policies, or be compromised by adversarial attacks. Mitigating these dangers necessitates mechanism to formally guarantee that an agents actions adhere to predefined safety constraints, challenge that existing systems do not fully address. We introduce Ve uar d, novel framework that provides formal safety guarantees for LLM-based agents through dual-stage architecture designed for robust and verifiable correctness. The initial offline stage involves comprehensive validation process. It begins by clarifying user intent to establish precise safety specifications. VeriGuard then synthesizes behavioral policy and subjects it to both testing and formal verification to prove its compliance with these specifications. This iterative process refines the policy until it is deemed correct. Subsequently, the second stage provides online action monitoring, where VeriGuard operates as runtime monitor to validate each proposed agent action against the pre-verified policy before execution. This separation of the exhaustive offline validation from the lightweight online monitoring allows formal guarantees to be practically applied, providing robust safeguard that substantially improves the trustworthiness of LLM agents. 1. Introduction The proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) agents marks significant leap towards autonomous AI systems capable of executing complex, multi-step tasks (Xi et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023).

Language models use positional, lexical, and reflexive mechanisms to bind and retrieve entities, with a causal model achieving high accuracy in predicting next tokens across various tasks and input lengths.  					AI-generated summary 				 A key component of in-context reasoning is the ability of language models (LMs) to bind entities for later retrieval. For example, an LM might represent "Ann loves pie" by binding "Ann" to "pie", allowing it to later retrieve "Ann" when asked "Who loves pie?" Prior research on short lists of bound entities found strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional mechanism, where "Ann" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this work, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings; as the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism becomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we find that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism (retrieving "Ann" using its bound counterpart "pie") and a reflexive mechanism (retrieving "Ann" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on nine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs mix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to develop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token distributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes to substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity groups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural settings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs bind and retrieve entities in-context.

"Language models use positional, lexical, and reflexive mechanisms to bind and retrieve entities, with a causal model achieving high accuracy in predicting next tokens across various tasks and input lengths.  					AI-generated summary 				 A key component of in-context reasoning is the ability of language models (LMs) to bind entities for later retrieval. For example, an LM might represent "Ann loves pie" by binding "Ann" to "pie", allowing it to later retrieve "Ann" when asked "Who loves pie?" Prior research on short lists of bound entities found strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional mechanism, where "Ann" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this work, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings; as the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism becomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we find that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism (retrieving "Ann" using its bound counterpart "pie") and a reflexive mechanism (retrieving "Ann" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on nine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs mix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to develop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token distributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes to substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity groups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural settings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs bind and retrieve entities in-context."

VeriGuard is a framework that ensures formal safety guarantees for LLM-based agents through offline validation and online monitoring.  					AI-generated summary 				 The deployment of autonomous AI agents in sensitive domains, such as healthcare, introduces critical risks to safety, security, and privacy. These agents may deviate from user objectives, violate data handling policies, or be compromised by adversarial attacks. Mitigating these dangers necessitates a mechanism to formally guarantee that an agent's actions adhere to predefined safety constraints, a challenge that existing systems do not fully address. We introduce VeriGuard, a novel framework that provides formal safety guarantees for LLM-based agents through a dual-stage architecture designed for robust and verifiable correctness. The initial offline stage involves a comprehensive validation process. It begins by clarifying user intent to establish precise safety specifications. VeriGuard then synthesizes a behavioral policy and subjects it to both testing and formal verification to prove its compliance with these specifications. This iterative process refines the policy until it is deemed correct. Subsequently, the second stage provides online action monitoring, where VeriGuard operates as a runtime monitor to validate each proposed agent action against the pre-verified policy before execution. This separation of the exhaustive offline validation from the lightweight online monitoring allows formal guarantees to be practically applied, providing a robust safeguard that substantially improves the trustworthiness of LLM agents.
