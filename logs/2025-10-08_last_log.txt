Diffusion language models promise bidirectional context and infilling capabilities that autoregressive coders lack, yet practical systems remain heavyweight. We introduce CoDA, 1.7B-parameter diffusion coder trained on TPU with fully open-source training pipeline. CoDA pairs large-scale diffusion pre-training with code-centric mid-training and instruction tuning, enabling confidence-guided sampling that keeps inference latency competitive. On Humaneval, MBPP, and EvalPlus, CoDA-1.7B-Instruct matches or surpasses diffusion models up to 7B parameters. Our release includes model checkpoints, evaluation harnesses, and TPU training pipelines to accelerate research on lightweight diffusion-based coding assistants. Code: https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/CoDA Model: https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/CoDA-v0-Instruct Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced automatic code generation, powering developer assistants that translate natural language intent into working programs. Open-source models such as StarCoder [Li et al., 2023] and Qwen3-Coder [Yang et al., 2025] exemplify the progress of the autoregressive (AR) paradigm, which predicts code token-by-token. Despite their success, AR decoders propagate errors sequentially, struggle to leverage context bidirectionally, and falter on tasks such as filling in missing code segments or editing large spans of text. Diffusion language models (DLMs) offer an attractive alternative [Nie et al., 2025, Gong et al., 2025, Ye et al., 2025]. Instead of generating each token sequentially, DLMs generate sequences through an iterative denoising process: forward stage corrupts text by adding noise (e.g., "

In this work, we propose Fast-dLLM v2, carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text generationrequiring only 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This represents 500 reduction in training data compared to full-attention diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original models performance. Our approach introduces novel training recipe that combines block diffusion mechanism with complementary attention mask, enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design hierarchical caching mechanism: block-level cache that stores historical context representations across blocks, and sub-block cache that enables efficient parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5 speedup over standard AR decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMsmarking significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

[ 1 2 4 3 5 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r MARGIN ADAPTIVE DPO: LEVERAGING REWARD MODEL FOR GRANULAR CONTROL IN PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATIONHyung Gyu Rho sirano1004@gmail.comDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as simple and effective method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on fixed temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data, causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones. Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more targeted approach of β-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its batch-level adaptation applies single, compromised temperature to mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative β values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference Optimization (MADPO), method that provides stable, data-preserving, and instance-level solution. MADPO employs practical two-step approach: it first trains reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these margins to apply continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs, allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has well-behaved optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We validate our theory with experiments on sentiment generation task, where MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3% on High Quality data and +10.5% on Low Quality data over the next-best method. Our results establish MADPO as more robust and principled approach to preference alignment. The code for our experiments is available online at https://github.com/sirano1004/ Margin-Apative-Direct-Preference-Optimization. Keywords Direct Preference Optimization Preference Alignment Adaptive RegularizationAligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences has become cornerstone of modern AI, enabling models that are more helpful and harmless [Bai et al., 2022], follow complex instructions [Ouyang et al., 2022], and excel at sophisticated tasks [Ziegler et al., 2019]. The dominant paradigm for this is learning from preference data, which has given rise to range of powerful techniques. While early successes were driven by multi-stage methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), the field has recently seen the emergence of more direct and stable approaches, most notably Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [Rafailov et al., 2023]. While DPO offers more direct approach to preference alignment, its effectiveness is constrained by critical factor: the joint influence of the temperature parameter, β, and the quality of the preference data. Seminal work in this area by Wu et al. [2024a] demonstrated that the optimal choice of β is highly contingent on the reward margin of given pair. Their analysis revealed that easy pairs with large margin benefit from high, conservative β to prevent overfitting, whereas hard pairs with subtle margin require low, aggressive β to ensure the learning signal is captured. The vanilla DPO framework, with its single fixed β applied to all samples, is fundamentally unable to reconcile these competing Margin Adaptive DPO: Leveraging Reward Model for Granular Control in Preference Optimization requirements. This inherent tension has motivated recent work on adaptive regularization strategies, which aim to tailor the learning objective to the difficulty of each preference pair. The challenge of adaptive regularization has led to several innovations that improve upon vanilla DPO. Identity Preference Optimization (IPO) [Azar et al., 2024], for instance, effectively mitigates the general overfitting issue by replacing the loss function with squared-error objective. While not explicitly designed to resolve the tension between highand low-margin data, its uniform target margin partially addresses the problem by regularizing easy pairs, though at the risk of being overly conservative on more informative examples. The most direct attempt to solve this is β-DPO [Wu et al., 2024a], which introduces adaptive, batch-level strategies. However, while demonstrating improved results, its mechanisms introduce significant new challenges. Its β-batch adaptation, for instance, is potentially unstableproducing divergent negative β for difficult dataand applies single, compromised temperature to mixedmargin batches. Furthermore, its β-guided filtering approach can be data-inefficient, as it potentially discards very high and low margin samples that may still contain useful learning signals. These issues of potential instability, coarse granularity, and data inefficiency highlight the need for solution that is not only instance-level and data-preserving, but also inherently stable. In this paper, to address these challenges, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference Optimization (MADPO), method that precisely controls the DPO objective through practical two-step process. First, we train standard reward model to learn how strongly one response is preferred over another for each training example. Our approach then leverages this reward model to guide the DPO policy, which works by learning to match the preferences captured by the reward model. MADPO strategically modifies the strength of the preference signal from the reward model before showing it to the policy. For hard and informative pairs, it amplifies the signal to make the preference seem stronger, forcing the policy to learn more aggressively, achieving the same effect as low β. Conversely, for easy and uninformative examples where the preference is already obvious, it dampens the signal to make the preference seem weaker, which provides stabilizing, per-sample regularization, achieving the same effect as high β. This strategic modification of the preference signal allows for granular, instance-level control, making the alignment process more robust and data-efficient. Our theoretical analysis validates the design of MADPO. We demonstrate that its instance-level weighting scheme successfully regularizes th"

Text:"5 2 0 2 5 ] . s [ 1 7 8 0 4 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r CONTEXTUAL QUALITY REWARD MODEL FOR RELIABLE AND EFFICIENT BEST-OF-N SAMPLINGHyung Gyu Rho sirano1004@gmail.comModern preference alignment techniques, such as Best-of-N (BoN) sampling, rely on reward models trained with pairwise comparison data. While effective at learning relative preferences, this paradigm fails to capture signal of response acceptability, leaving systems vulnerable to selecting the least bad of many unacceptable options. This is particularly problematic for hard prompts, where the risk of such false acceptances increases with the number of samples. In this paper, we address this critical reliability gap by introducing new data collection and modeling framework. By augmenting preference data with an outside option, inspired by discrete choice models, we train reward model that can distinguish not just what is better, but what is good enough. We leverage this capability to create an adaptive inference strategy, best of mini-N in-loop, which partitions the generation budget into sequential loops with calibrated, early-exit condition. Our experiments show that when tuned as an alignment guardrail, it reduces reliability failures by 70%, and when tuned as an inference accelerator, it improves average inference speed by over 22% in IMDB-sentiment setting. We thus provide principled and flexible framework for practitioners to explicitly manage the trade-off between reliability and computational efficiency. Keywords Reward Model Inference Time Alignment Discrete ChoiceThe capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been significantly enhanced through alignment with human feedbackmaking them more helpful and harmless [Bai et al., 2022], instruction-following [Ouyang et al., 2022], and capable of sophisticated tasks [Ziegler et al., 2019]. Such advances are driven by preference-based alignment methods, ranging from inference-time techniques like Best-of-N (BoN) sampling [Nakano et al., 2021, Ouyang et al., 2022] to post-training optimization approaches like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [Rafailov et al., 2023]. Crucially, the effectiveness of these approaches depends entirely on the data used to train their underlying preference models. Current methods predominantly rely on pairwise comparison datasets, where humans select the better of two responses. This paradigm, rooted in models like BradleyTerry [Bradley and Terry, 1952], has an inherent limitation: it only captures relative preference, not response acceptability. While the field often implicitly treats the chosen response as desirable [Jung et al., 2024, Ethayarajh et al., 2024], the data merely indicates that it is better than the alternative. As result, reward model trained this way can rank responses but cannot determine whether response is acceptable or unacceptable [Wang et al., 2023]. This limitation critically undermines BoN sampling. There is no guarantee that the best of options meets minimum quality threshold. It is possible that BoN simply selects the least bad of many poor options. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing new data collection protocol that extends standard pairwise comparisons with an outside option. By allowing annotators to reject all candidate responses, our method captures direct signal of contextual acceptability. We show that reward model trained on this richer data can distinguish between responses that are merely better and those that are genuinely acceptable within the context. This seemingly simple modification unlocks several critical capabilities that we demonstrate in this paper: Contextual Quality Reward Model for Reliable and Efficient Best-of-N Sampling PREPRINT First, we provide rigorous analysis and empirical evidence showing that standard Best-of-N (BoN) sampling is unreliable for challenging prompts. We demonstrate that as more candidates are generated, the risk of false acceptanceselecting response that is merely the least bad and does not meet minimum quality thresholdincreases significantly. Our experiments show that the number of such reliability failures for the baseline method more than doubles when scaling from = 1 to = 32. Building on this, we introduce novel adaptive inference strategy, Best of mini-N in-loop, which leverages the signal of contextual acceptability captured by our reward model. This single, flexible framework partitions large generation budget into smaller, sequential loops and checks if an acceptable response has been found, enabling an early exit. This strategy is powerful because it can be tuned for two distinct goals: serving as robust guardrail for reliability-critical tasks or as an efficiency optimizer for speed-critical ones. For reliability critical applications, the framework can be configured as what we term an Alignment Guardrail. By setting calibrated quality threshold, the system refrains from outputting response unless it is demonstrably acceptable. This is essential in contexts like customer-facing chatbots. For instance, rather than providing policy-compliant but unhelpful response (the least bad option it could generate), the system can recognize that no candidate will satisfy the user and instead escalate the query to human agent. This prevents user frustration and ensures higher standard of interaction. Our experiments confirm this is highly effective, reducing the number of false acceptances by 70% compared to the standard BoN baseline. This ability to abstain or invoke fallback strategies is crucial capability for safe and reliable systems [Lightman et al., 2023, Snell et al., 2024, Kang et al., 2025, Bai et al., 2022]. Conversely, for speed critical applications where slight misalignment is tolerable, such as document summarization, the same framework can be configured as fast Inference Accelerator. Here, the goal shifts from finding the best response to finding the first acceptable one. By terminating the generation process as soon as good-enough candidate is identified, our method achieves the fastest possible inference time. Our experiments show this approach outperforms the baseline by over 22% on average. This establishes clear and tunable trade-off between reliability and computational efficiency that is absent in current methods. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews related work in preference alignment and inference efficiency. Section 3 details the choice-theoretic formulation of our reward model. Section 4 pre"

TaTToo, a novel table-grounded Process Reward Model, enhances tabular reasoning by explicitly addressing table-specific operations and integrating tool-based verification, leading to significant performance improvements over existing PRMs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs), particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i) reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

Fast-dLLM v2, a block diffusion language model, efficiently converts pretrained autoregressive models for parallel text generation, achieving significant speedup without compromising accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask, enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs - marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

EgoNight is a comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, focusing on visual question answering and revealing performance gaps between day and night conditions for multimodal large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions. Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

FlowRVS addresses the challenges of Referring Video Object Segmentation by reformulating the task as a continuous flow problem, leveraging pretrained T2V models and achieving state-of-the-art results.  					AI-generated summary 				 Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic `locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts (e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a J&F of 51.1 in MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7), demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks as continuous deformation processes.

"FlowRVS addresses the challenges of Referring Video Object Segmentation by reformulating the task as a continuous flow problem, leveraging pretrained T2V models and achieving state-of-the-art results.  					AI-generated summary 				 Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic `locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts (e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a J&F of 51.1 in MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7), demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks as continuous deformation processes."

AInstein evaluates the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by testing their ability to generate valid solutions to AI research problems using only pretrained knowledge, revealing both their potential and limitations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions, then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal, review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on 1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster), using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential and their current limitations.

MADPO, a margin-adaptive method, enhances preference alignment in large language models by providing instance-level adaptive weighting to the DPO loss, improving performance across datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data, causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones. Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more targeted approach of beta-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative beta values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs, allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method. Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to preference alignment.

While effective at learning relative preferences, this paradigm fails to capture a signal of response acceptability, leaving systems vulnerable to selecting the least bad of many unacceptable options. This is particularly problematic for hard prompts, where the risk of such false acceptances increases with the number of samples. In this paper, we address this critical reliability gap by introducing a new data collection and modeling framework. By augmenting preference data with an outside option, inspired by discrete choice models, we train a reward model that can distinguish not just what is better, but what is good enough. We leverage this capability to create an adaptive inference strategy, best of mini-N in-loop, which partitions the generation budget into sequential loops with a calibrated, early-exit condition. Our experiments show that when tuned as an alignment guardrail, it reduces reliability failures by 70\%, and when tuned as an inference accelerator, it improves average inference speed by over 22\% in IMDB-sentiment setting. We thus provide a principled and flexible framework for practitioners to explicitly manage the trade-off between reliability and computational efficiency.

WebDetective is a benchmark for evaluating multi-hop reasoning in RAG systems and web agents, addressing issues of reasoning path leakage and single-pass evaluation, and introducing a framework to improve knowledge utilization and refusal behavior.  					AI-generated summary 				 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly evaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two major limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation, and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow, EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies, incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.

DRIFT, a dissatisfaction-refined iterative preference training method, improves large language models using implicit user dissatisfaction signals, achieving better performance than existing methods on real-world datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems, code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce DRIFT (Dissatisfaction-Refined Iterative preFerence Training), which anchors training on real-world DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy. Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world WildFeedback datasets and synthetic UltraFeedback datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) / +7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B) on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training that leverages the most abundant and informative signal. The code and data are available at https://github.com/cacayaya/DRIFT.git.

Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training that leverages the most abundant and informative signal.
