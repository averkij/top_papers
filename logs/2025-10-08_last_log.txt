Text:"Scaling Code-Assisted Chain-of-Thoughts and Instructions for Model Reasoning Honglin Lin1,2, Qizhi Pei1, Xin Gao1,2, Zhuoshi Pan1, Yu Li1, Juntao Li3, Conghui He1, Lijun Wu1 1OpenDataLab, Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, 2Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 3Soochow University Reasoning capability is pivotal for Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks, yet achieving reliable and scalable reasoning remains challenging. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become mainstream approach, existing methods often suffer from uncontrolled generation, insufficient quality, and limited diversity in reasoning paths. Recent efforts leverage code to enhance CoT by grounding reasoning in executable steps, but such methods are typically constrained to predefined mathematical problems, hindering scalability and generalizability. In this work, we propose Caco (Code-Assisted Chain-of-ThOught), novel framework that automates the synthesis of high-quality, verifiable, and diverse instruction-CoT reasoning data through code-driven augmentation. Unlike prior work, Caco first fine-tunes code-based CoT generator on existing math and programming solutions in unified code format, then scales the data generation to large amount of diverse reasoning traces. Crucially, we introduce automated validation via code execution and rule-based filtering to ensure logical correctness and structural diversity, followed by reverse-engineering filtered outputs into natural language instructions and language CoTs to enrich task adaptability. This closedloop process enables fully automated, scalable synthesis of reasoning data with guaranteed executability. Experiments on our created Caco-1.3M dataset demonstrate that Caco-trained models achieve strong competitive performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming existing strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that Cacos code-anchored verification and instruction diversity contribute to superior generalization across "

HoloScene is an interactive 3D reconstruction framework that achieves geometry completeness, object interactivity, physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, and realistic physical properties through an energy-based optimization problem.  					AI-generated summary 				 Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity, physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance, and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships. Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem, integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry, physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance, while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

"HoloScene is an interactive 3D reconstruction framework that achieves geometry completeness, object interactivity, physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, and realistic physical properties through an energy-based optimization problem.  					AI-generated summary 				 Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity, physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance, and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships. Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem, integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry, physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance, while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

The paper proposes stage-specific strategies to accelerate diffusion model inference in video generation, reducing memory usage and maintaining quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper, we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage, while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range.

Caco, a code-assisted chain-of-thought framework, automates the generation of high-quality, verifiable, and diverse reasoning data, enhancing the performance of large language models on mathematical reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning capability is pivotal for Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks, yet achieving reliable and scalable reasoning remains challenging. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become a mainstream approach, existing methods often suffer from uncontrolled generation, insufficient quality, and limited diversity in reasoning paths. Recent efforts leverage code to enhance CoT by grounding reasoning in executable steps, but such methods are typically constrained to predefined mathematical problems, hindering scalability and generalizability. In this work, we propose Caco (Code-Assisted Chain-of-ThOught), a novel framework that automates the synthesis of high-quality, verifiable, and diverse instruction-CoT reasoning data through code-driven augmentation. Unlike prior work, Caco first fine-tunes a code-based CoT generator on existing math and programming solutions in a unified code format, then scales the data generation to a large amount of diverse reasoning traces. Crucially, we introduce automated validation via code execution and rule-based filtering to ensure logical correctness and structural diversity, followed by reverse-engineering filtered outputs into natural language instructions and language CoTs to enrich task adaptability. This closed-loop process enables fully automated, scalable synthesis of reasoning data with guaranteed executability. Experiments on our created Caco-1.3M dataset demonstrate that Caco-trained models achieve strong competitive performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming existing strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that Caco's code-anchored verification and instruction diversity contribute to superior generalization across unseen tasks. Our work establishes a paradigm for building self-sustaining, trustworthy reasoning systems without human intervention.

AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks: translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework, MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone, leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context, and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness. Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR 0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2, plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

  "desc": "MeDiM — это первая медицинская модель дискретной диффузии, которая объединяет разные типы биомедицинских данных (изображения, текст и клинические записи) в едином вероятностном пространстве без модально-специфичных компонентов. В основе модели лежит мультимодальная LLM с модифицированной архитектурой: убрана каузальная маска внимания для двунаправленного контекста и добавлены непрерывные timestep embeddings для диффузионного процесса. Модель способна переводить между изображениями и текстом, а также генерировать согласованные пары медицинских изображений и отчётов по текстовым запросам. Эксперименты показывают высокое качество генерации и улучшение результатов на downstream-задачах при использовании совместно сгенерированных пар изображение-отчёт.",
