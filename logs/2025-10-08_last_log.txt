[ 1 5 8 4 5 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r TensorBLEU: Vectorized GPU-based BLEU Score Implementation for Per-Sentence In-Training Evaluation Adam Filipek (adamfilipek@rxai.dev) Reactive AI (https://rxai.dev) October 2025 Abstract Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale, yet the tools for their evaluation often remain computational bottleneck, limiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training evaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement Learning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on the GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, novel implementation of the BLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our approach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation within PyTorch and introduces memory-efficient counting mechanism. By creating compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using torch.unique, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of traditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for large-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard library for tokenID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that TensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and exceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance transforms significant bottleneck into negligible part of the training loop. By clearly defining its role as Token-ID BLEU for development purposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide powerful tool for accelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning. The advancement in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been driven by the scaling of neural architectures and datasets. However, while models have become exponentially more powerful, the tools for their evaluation have often failed to keep pace. Metrics that cannot efficiently process batches of data in parallel on the "

Q. Chen1 1FAIR at Meta, 2Univ. Grenoble Alpes, Inria, CNRS, Grenoble INP, LJK, France We present OneFlow, the first non-autoregressive multimodal model that enables variable-length and concurrent mixed-modal generation. Unlike autoregressive models that enforce rigid causal ordering between text and image generation, OneFlow combines an insertion-based Edit Flow for discrete text tokens with Flow Matching for image latents. OneFlow enables concurrent text-image synthesis with hierarchical sampling that prioritizes content over grammar. Through controlled experiments across model sizes from 1B to 8B, we demonstrate that OneFlow outperforms autoregressive baselines on both generation and understanding tasks while using up to 50% fewer training FLOPs. OneFlow surpasses both autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches while unlocking new capabilities for concurrent generation, iterative refinement, and natural reasoning-like generation. Website: johnlnguyen.com/oneflow Figure 1 OneFlow is variable-length non-autoregressive model that can concurrently generate interleaved text and variable number of images using insertions as primitive operation. Native Multimodal Models models capable of handling both multimodal understanding and generation within single backbone have advanced considerably in visual understanding and generation. These models typically employ unified transformer architecture with next-token prediction to handle both discrete and continuous generation (Team, 2024; Wu et al., 2025; Ma et al., 2025; Deng et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025). Recent work like Transfusion (Zhou et al., 2025) and Show-O (Xie et al., 2024) demonstrates that leveraging modality-specific training objectives within shared architectures can significantly improve performance, particularly on con"

Equilibrium Matching (EqM) is a generative modeling framework that learns an equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape, enabling efficient sampling and outperforming traditional diffusion and flow models.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256times256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

TensorBLEU is a GPU-accelerated BLEU metric implementation for efficient in-training evaluation of natural language processing models, offering significant speedups over CPU-based methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale, yet the tools for their evaluation often remain a computational bottleneck, limiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training evaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement Learning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on the GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, a novel implementation of the BLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our approach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation within PyTorch and introduces a memory-efficient counting mechanism. By creating a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using torch.unique, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of traditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for large-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard library for token-ID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that TensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and exceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance transforms a significant bottleneck into a negligible part of the training loop. By clearly defining its role as a "Token-ID BLEU" for development purposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide a powerful tool for accelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning.

OneFlow, a non-autoregressive multimodal model, achieves superior performance in text-image generation and understanding tasks with reduced computational cost compared to autoregressive and diffusion-based models.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present OneFlow, the first non-autoregressive multimodal model that enables variable-length and concurrent mixed-modal generation. Unlike autoregressive models that enforce rigid causal ordering between text and image generation, OneFlow combines an insertion-based Edit Flow for discrete text tokens with Flow Matching for image latents. OneFlow enables concurrent text-image synthesis with hierarchical sampling that prioritizes content over grammar. Through controlled experiments across model sizes from 1B to 8B, we demonstrate that OneFlow outperforms autoregressive baselines on both generation and understanding tasks while using up to 50% fewer training FLOPs. OneFlow surpasses both autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches while unlocking new capabilities for concurrent generation, iterative refinement, and natural reasoning-like generation.
