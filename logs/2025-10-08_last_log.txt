DeepEvolve integrates deep research with algorithm evolution to propose, refine, implement, and test new hypotheses, improving initial algorithms across various scientific domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution, as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution, uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents, DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable new algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided evolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery.

Systematic investigation reveals that large language models are more sensitive to structural than semantic code perturbations, with implications for training data design.  					AI-generated summary 				 Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist. Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Проведя более 3000 экспериментов с контролируемыми изменениями кода на десяти языках программирования, они обнаружили, что LLM гораздо более чувствительны к нарушениям структуры кода, чем к семантическим искажениям. Оказалось, что псевдокод и блок-схемы могут быть столь же эффективны для обучения, как и реальный код, а даже повреждённый код с неверными сигналами остаётся конкурентоспособным при сохранении поверхностных паттернов. Исследование также показало, что выбор языка программирования имеет значение: Python лучше подходит для задач на естественном языке, тогда как низкоуровневые языки вроде Java и Rust — для математических задач."
