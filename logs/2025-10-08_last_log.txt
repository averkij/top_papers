Correspondence: research@collinear.ai Date: October 8,Test-time scaling techniques have enabled large language models (LLMs) to perform complex multi-step reasoning through chain-of-thought (CoT) style processes. Models such as DeepSeek-R1 Guo et al. (2025) and QwQ-32B Team (2025) demonstrated strong reasoning abilities, particularly in the domains of mathematics, science and coding. These, in turn, have amplified efforts to distill test-time compute gains via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) into smaller fine-tuned models. Recent work has demonstrated that LLMs can be taught to produce such long CoT reasoning through distillation in surprisingly data-efficient manner Muennighoff et al. (2025); Ye et al. (2025). For example, Li et al. (2025) fine-tuned 32B model on only 17k reasoning samples and achieved dramatic gains on competitive coding benchmarks comparable to larger models. Despite the growing body of work on curating high-quality post-training data for reasoning distillation for frontier coding performance Guha et al. (2025); Ahmad et al. (2025b), only limited focus has been given to the training dynamics of these student models and how these dynamics influence the acquisition of reasoning abilities. In this work, we investigate how reasoning abilities are distilled into non-reasoning student models, specifically asking whether their reasoning abilities emerge linearly. We hypothesize that, for small non-reasoning LLMs in low to mediumlow data regime, distillation does not yield monotonic improvements: performance initially declines when trained on small data, then steadily improves as data scales, which we refer to as the valley of reasoning. Grounding our findings on model performances on LIVECODEBENCH (LCB) Jain et al. (2024), competitive coding benchmark, we validate this claim and observe sharper-than-log-linear trend once the model gets out of the valley (Fig 1). Inspired by the findings of Li et al. (2025), which argues that output structure rather than code correctness in data drives improvement, we further whether this conclusion holds uniformly across stages of distillation. We find that both during the non-reasoning phase and the intermediate phase where the model acquires decent reasoning skills, code correctness Accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 workshop on Deep Learning for Coding (DL4C) 1 Figure 1 Evaluation scores on LCB of two distilled small models show that performances initially decreases by half but then steadily increases in log-linear trend toward the 30K data upper bound. in data has little impact on evaluation performances. However, for both stages, we consistently observe that distillation data containing easier coding questions outperform the one with harder questions. This suggests that at low data regime, small models can better study after easier examples to yield immediate gains.SFT for Reasoning Distillation SFT on reasoning traces generated by reasoning models has proved effective at improving smaller models Guo et al. (2025). Motivated by this, many works have investigated methods for performing distillation. In particular, recent data-efficiency results show that small, carefully curated sets can already induce strong reasoning behavior in large (32B+) models Ye et al. (2025); Li et al. (2025), complementing early selfimprovement/distillation antecedents Zelikman et al. (2022, 2024). Several studies probe the components of reasoning traces: prefix-only supervision can enable highly efficient distillation Ji et al. (2025); reasoning quality of the distillation traces can impact downstream performance Luo et al. (2025); Yu et al. (2025); and the CoT lengths in the mixture can be tuned to optimize both token efficiency and model capabilities Wu et al. (2025); Ma et al. (2025); Xu et al. (2025). Strikingly, Li et al. (2025), Ahmad et al. (2025b), and Guha et al. (2025) have found that for models in low-data regimes, the correctness of the reasoning trace does not impact distillation quality. However, these works do not investigate how data quality impacts different stages of training, matter of practical importance in large-scale post-training processes. Scaling Distillation for Coding OpenThoughts Guha et al. (2025), OpenCodeReasoning (OCR) Ahmad et al. (2025b), and rStar-Coder Liu et al. (2025) find that competitive coding performance can be improved by scaling the reasoning dataset to millions with high question duplication counts. These works evaluate on robust, contamination-controlled code benchmarks such as LCB Jain et al. (2024) and CodeElo Quan et al. (2025), reinforcing the observed SFT-only gains. Together, they demonstrate the potential of large-scale SFT for dramatic improvements in base-model capabilities, but they do not focus on the model performance during intermediate data quantities. This motivates us to conduct an in-depth study on the training dynamics and progress on downstream evaluations."

Research on distilling coding skills from large language models to smaller ones reveals a "valley of code reasoning" where performance initially decreases with more data before improving sharply, and that small models benefit more from easier questions during distillation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Distilling the thinking traces of a Large Language Model (LLM) with reasoning capabilities into a smaller model has been proven effective. Yet, there is a scarcity of work done on how model performances scale with the quantity of distillation data. In this work, we study the scaling trend of distilling competitive coding skills on two small non-reasoning LLMs. We validate the hypothesis that there is a valley of code reasoning: downstream performance on competitive coding first drops as data quantity increases, then it steadily increases in a sharper-than-log-linear fashion. Having identified the trend, we further fine-tune the models at two different distillation stages on the same data to ground conclusions on their respective learning phases. We learn that across stages in the low and medium-low data regimes, small models benefit significantly from easier coding questions than from harder ones. We also find that, surprisingly, the correctness of outputs in training data makes no difference to distillation outcomes. Our work represents a step forward in understanding the training dynamics of code reasoning distillation outside intuition
