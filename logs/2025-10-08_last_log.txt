Text:"Scalable In-context Ranking with Generative Models Nilesh Gupta1, Chong You3, Srinadh Bhojanapalli3, Sanjiv Kumar3, Inderjit Dhillon1,2 and Felix Yu3 1UT Austin, 2Google, 3Google DeepMind 2025-10-08 In-context Ranking (ICR) is an emerging paradigm for Information Retrieval (IR), which leverages contextual understanding of LLMs by directly incorporating the task description, candidate documents, and the query into the models input prompt and tasking the LLM to identify relevant document(s). While it is effective, efficiency is significant challenge in this paradigm, especially as the candidate list grows due to quadratic / super-linear scaling of attention operation with context length. To this end, this paper first identifies inherent and exploitable structures in the attention of LLMs finetuned for ICR: (1) inter-document block sparsity attention is dense within each document block but sparse across different documents in the context; and (2) query-document block relevance the attention scores from certain query tokens to document block in middle layers strongly correlate with that documents actual relevance. Motivated by these observations, we introduce BlockRank (Blockwise In-context Ranking), novel method that adapts the attention operation in an LLM by (a) architecturally enforcing the observed inter-document block sparsity, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear without loss in performance, and (b) optimizing query-document block relevance for true relevant documents during fine-tuning using an auxiliary contrastive training objective, improving retrieval in attention. Experiments on BEIR, MSMarco and NQ with Mistral-7B demonstrate that BlockRank Mistral matches or outperforms existing SOTA listwise rankers and controlled fine-tuned baseline while being significantly more efficient at inference (4.7 for 100 MSMarco documents in context) and scaling gracefully to long-context shortlists - around 500 documents in-context ( 100𝐾 context length) wi"

BlockRank optimizes in-context ranking by enforcing inter-document block sparsity and enhancing query-document relevance, improving efficiency and scalability in large-scale information retrieval.  					AI-generated summary 				 In-context Ranking (ICR) is an emerging paradigm for Information Retrieval (IR), which leverages contextual understanding of LLMs by directly incorporating the task description, candidate documents, and the query into the model's input prompt and tasking the LLM to identify relevant document(s). While it is effective, efficiency is a significant challenge in this paradigm, especially as the candidate list grows due to quadratic/super-linear scaling of attention operation with context length. To this end, this paper first identifies inherent and exploitable structures in the attention of LLMs finetuned for ICR: (1) inter-document block sparsity: attention is dense within each document block but sparse across different documents in the context; and (2) query-document block relevance: the attention scores from certain query tokens to a document block in middle layers strongly correlate with that document's actual relevance. Motivated by these observations, we introduce BlockRank (Blockwise In-context Ranking), a novel method that adapts the attention operation in an LLM by (a) architecturally enforcing the observed inter-document block sparsity, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear without loss in performance, and (b) optimizing query-document block relevance for true relevant documents during fine-tuning using an auxiliary contrastive training objective, improving retrieval in attention. Experiments on BEIR, MSMarco and NQ with Mistral-7B demonstrate that FLARE Mistral matches or outperforms existing SOTA listwise rankers and controlled fine-tuned baseline while being significantly more efficient at inference (4.7x for 100 MSMarco documents in context) and scaling gracefully to long-context shortlists, around 500 documents in-context (approximately 100K context length) within a second, presenting a scalable and effective solution for ICR.
