Text:"The Geometry of Reasoning: Flowing Logics in Representation Space Yufa Zhou*, Yixiao Wang*, Xunjian Yin*, Shuyan Zhou, Anru R. Zhang Duke University {yufa.zhou,yixiao.wang,xunjian.yin,shuyan.zhou,anru.zhang}@duke.edu *Equal contribution. 5 2 0 2 0 1 ] . [ 1 2 8 7 9 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r We study how large language models (LLMs) think through their representation space. We propose novel geometric framework that models an LLMs reasoning as flowsembedding trajectories evolving where logic goes. We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature, enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both conceptual foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs behavior. Code: https://github.com/MasterZhou1/Reasoning-Flow Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MasterZhou/Reasoning-Flow Reasoning is nothing but reckoning. Thomas Hobbes 1. Introduction The geometry of concept space, i.e., the idea that meaning can be represented as positions in structured geometric space, has long served as unifying perspective across AI, cognitive science, and linguistic philosophy [15, 59, 16]. Early work in this tradition was limited by the absence of precise and scalable semantic representations. With the rise of large language models (LLMs) [28, 52, 19, 21, 75], we revisit this geo"

Text:"5 2 0 2 0 1 ] . [ 1 6 7 7 9 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r Why Do Transformers Fail to Forecast Time Series In-Context? Yufa Zhou1*, Yixiao Wang1*, Surbhi Goel2, Anru R. Zhang1 1Duke University, 2University of Pennsylvania {yufa.zhou,yixiao.wang,anru.zhang}@duke.edu, surbhig@cis.upenn.edu Abstract Time series forecasting (TSF) remains challenging and largely unsolved problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models, on TSF tasks; however, rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In this paper, we provide theoretical analysis of Transformers limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL) theory. Specifically, under AR(p) data, we establish that: (1) Linear Self-Attention (LSA) models cannot achieve lower expected MSE than classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings through carefully designed experiments1. Our theory not only sheds light on several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper scrutiny. The only thing we know about the future is that it will be different. Peter Drucker Time series forecasting (TSF), fundamental and longstanding challenge in machine learning, involves predicting future observations based on historical data ["

We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes. We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature, enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows' velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

Theoretical analysis reveals that Transformers, particularly Linear Self-Attention models, have limitations in time series forecasting compared to classical linear models, with predictions collapsing to the mean under Chain-of-Thought inference.  					AI-generated summary 				 Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models, on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL) theory. Specifically, under AR(p) data, we establish that: (1) Linear Self-Attention (LSA) models cannot achieve lower expected MSE than classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper scrutiny.

"Theoretical analysis reveals that Transformers, particularly Linear Self-Attention models, have limitations in time series forecasting compared to classical linear models, with predictions collapsing to the mean under Chain-of-Thought inference.  					AI-generated summary 				 Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models, on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL) theory. Specifically, under AR(p) data, we establish that: (1) Linear Self-Attention (LSA) models cannot achieve lower expected MSE than classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper scrutiny."
