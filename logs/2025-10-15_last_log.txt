Text:"5 2 0 2 4 1 ] . [ 1 9 6 2 2 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r Tensor Logic Tensor Logic: The Language of AI Pedro Domingos Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering University of Washington Seattle, WA 98195-2350, USA pedrod@cs.washington.edu Abstract Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of programming language with all the requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python, which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning and knowledge acquisition has led to long and costly series of hacky attempts to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation, based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. show how to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible, such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of symbolic reasoning, and is potentially basis for the wider adoption of AI. Keywords: deep learning, automated reasoning, knowledge representation, logic programming, Einstein summation, embeddings, kernel machines, probabilistic graphical models 1. Introduction Fields take off when they find their language. Physics took off when Newton invented calculus, and couldnt have done so without it. Maxwells equations would be unusable without Heavisides vector calculus notation. As mathematicians and physicists like to say, good notation "

This paper documents the technical desiderata, threat models, and practical challenges of deploying such system at internet scale, addressing key requirements of effectiveness, fidelity, robustness, and security. SynthID-Image has been used to watermark over ten billion images and video frames across Googles services and its corresponding verification service is available to trusted testers. For completeness, we present an experimental evaluation of an external model variant, SynthID-O, which is available through partnerships. We benchmark SynthID-O against other post-hoc watermarking methods from the literature, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both visual quality and robustness to common image perturbations. While this work centers on visual media, the conclusions on deployment, constraints, and threat modeling generalize to other modalities, including audio. This paper provides comprehensive documentation for the large-scale deployment of deep learning-based media provenance systems. Keywords: provenance, watermarking, robustness 1.

SynthID-Image, a deep learning system for watermarking AI-generated imagery, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in visual quality and robustness, and is deployed across Google's services.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce SynthID-Image, a deep learning-based system for invisibly watermarking AI-generated imagery. This paper documents the technical desiderata, threat models, and practical challenges of deploying such a system at internet scale, addressing key requirements of effectiveness, fidelity, robustness, and security. SynthID-Image has been used to watermark over ten billion images and video frames across Google's services and its corresponding verification service is available to trusted testers. For completeness, we present an experimental evaluation of an external model variant, SynthID-O, which is available through partnerships. We benchmark SynthID-O against other post-hoc watermarking methods from the literature, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both visual quality and robustness to common image perturbations. While this work centers on visual media, the conclusions on deployment, constraints, and threat modeling generalize to other modalities, including audio. This paper provides a comprehensive documentation for the large-scale deployment of deep learning-based media provenance systems.

Система уже использовалась для маркировки более 10 миллиардов изображений и видеокадров в сервисах Google, демонстрируя высочайшее качество визуального восприятия и устойчивость к различным искажениям. В работе подробно описаны технические требования, модели угроз и практические вызовы развертывания такой системы в масштабе интернета. Хотя исследование сфокусировано на визуальных медиа, выводы о развертывании и моделировании угроз применимы и к другим модальностям, включая аудио.",
