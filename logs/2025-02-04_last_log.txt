[ 1 1 4 3 1 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aAligning visual features with language embeddings is key challenge in vision-language models (VLMs). The performance of such models hinges on having good connector that maps visual features generated by vision encoder to shared embedding space with the LLM while preserving semantic similarity. Existing connectors, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), often produce out-of-distribution or noisy inputs, leading to misalignment between the modalities. In this work, we propose novel vision-text alignment method, ALIGNVLM, that maps visual features to weighted average of LLM text embeddings. Our approach leverages the linguistic priors encoded by the LLM to ensure that visual features are mapped to regions of the space that the LLM can effectively interpret. ALIGNVLM is particularly effective for document understanding tasks, where scanned document images must be accurately mapped to their textual content. Our extensive experiments show that ALIGNVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to prior alignment methods. We provide further analysis demonstrating improved vision-text feature alignment and robustness to noise. 1.

The proposed ALIGN connector outperforms other methods across benchmarks using the same training configuration. Radial distance is proportion of maximal score, truncated at 0.7 (black dot). ing both the visual and textual contents of scanned documents (Kim et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a; 2024; Hu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023a; Rodriguez et al., 2024b). Such tasks are common in real-world commercial applications, including invoice parsing (Park et al., 2019), form reading (Jaume et al., 2019), and document question answering (Mathew et al., 2021b). VLM architectures typically consist of three components: (i) vision encoder to process raw images, (ii) Large Language Model (LLM) pre-trained on text, and (iii) connector module that maps the visual features from the vision encoder into the LLMs semantic space. central challenge in this pipeline is to effectively map the continuous feature embeddings of the vision encoder into the latent space of the LLM while preserving the semantic properties of visual concepts. Existing approaches can be broadly categorized into deep fusion and shallow fusion 1 ALIGNVLM: Bridging Vision and Language Latent Spaces for Multimodal Understanding methods. Deep fusion methods, such as NVLM (Dai et al., 2024), Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022), CogVLM (Wang et al., 2023b), and LLama 3.2-Vision (Grattafiori et al., 2024), integrate visual and textual features by introducing additional cross-attention and feed-forward layers at each layer of the LLM. While effective at enhancing cross-modal interaction, these methods substantially increase the parameter count of the VLM compared to the base LLM, resulting in high computational overhead and reduced efficiency. In contrast, shallow fusion methods project visual features from the vision encoder into the LLM input embedding space using either multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) (Liu et al., 2023b; 2024) or attention-based mechanisms such as the Perceiver Resampler (Li et al., 2023; Laurencon et al., 2024; Alayrac et al., 2022), before concatenating them with the textual prompts input embeddings. This approach is more parameter-efficient and computationally lighter than deep fusion methods, but it lacks mechanism to ensure the projected embeddings remain within the region spanned by the LLMs text embeddings i.e. regions the LLM was pretrained to understand. As result, unconstrained visual features can produce out-of-distribution (OOD) and noisy inputs, leading to misalignment between modalities and often degrading overall performance. Recent methods like Ovis (Lu et al., 2024) attempt to alleviate these issues by introducing separate visual embeddings indexed from the vision encoder outputs and combined together to construct the visual inputs to the LLM. However, this approach significantly increases parameter count due to the massive embedding matrix and requires extensive training to learn new embedding space without guaranteeing alignment with the LLMs input latent space. To address these limitations, this paper introduces ALIGNVLM, novel framework that sidesteps direct projection of visual features into the LLM embedding space. Instead, our proposed connector, ALIGN, maps visual features into probability distributions over the LLMs existing pretrained vocabulary embeddings, which are then combined into weighted representation of the text embeddings. By constraining each visual feature as convex combination of the LLM text embeddings, our approach leverages the linguistic priors already encoded in the LLMs text space. This ensures that the resulting visual features lie within the convex hull of the LLMs embedding space, reducing the risk of noisy or out-of-distribution inputs and improving alignment between modalities. Our experimental results show that this approach improves performance on various document understanding tasks, outperforming prior connector methods by effectively fusing visual and linguistic content. We summarize our main contributions as follows: We introduce family of Vision-Language Models, ALIGNVLM, that achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal document understanding tasks by leveraging ALIGN. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness "

Aligning visual features with language embeddings is a key challenge in vision-language models (VLMs). The performance of such models hinges on having a good connector that maps visual features generated by a vision encoder to a shared embedding space with the LLM while preserving semantic similarity. Existing connectors, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), often produce out-of-distribution or noisy inputs, leading to misalignment between the modalities. In this work, we propose a novel vision-text alignment method, AlignVLM, that maps visual features to a weighted average of LLM text embeddings. Our approach leverages the linguistic priors encoded by the LLM to ensure that visual features are mapped to regions of the space that the LLM can effectively interpret. AlignVLM is particularly effective for document understanding tasks, where scanned document images must be accurately mapped to their textual content. Our extensive experiments show that AlignVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to prior alignment methods. We provide further analysis demonstrating improved vision-text feature alignment and robustness to noise.
