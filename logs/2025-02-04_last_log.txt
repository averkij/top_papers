Text:"5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 8 0 2 1 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Almost Surely Safe Alignment of Large Language Models at Inference-Time Xiaotong Ji * 1 2 Shyam Sundhar Ramesh * 1 3 Matthieu Zimmer * 1 Ilija Bogunovic 3 Jun Wang 3 Haitham Bou Ammarto ensure their outputs are free from controversial content. Even highly capable large language models (LLMs) can produce biased or unsafe responses, and alignment techniques, such as RLHF, aimed at mitigating this issue, are expensive and prone to overfitting as they retrain the LLM. This paper introduces novel inference-time alignment approach that ensures LLMs generate safe responses almost surely, i.e., with probability approaching one. We achieve this by framing the safe generation of inference-time responses as constrained Markov decision process within the LLMs latent space. Crucially, we augment safety state that tracks the evolution of safety constraints and enables us to demonstrate formal safety guarantees upon solving the MDP in the latent space. Building on this foundation, we propose InferenceGuard, practical implementation that safely aligns LLMs without modifying the model weights. Empirically, we demonstrate InferenceGuard effectively balances safety and task performance, outperforming existing inference-time alignment methods in generating safe and aligned responses. Contains potentially harmful examples. 1. Introduction LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse set of tasks, such as summarization (Koh et al., 2022; Stiennon et al., 2020), code generation (Gao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2021), and embodied robotics (Mower et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024). However, since those models are primarily trained on vast, unsupervised datasets, their generated responses can often be biased, inaccurate, or harmful (Deshpande et al., 2023; Ganguli et al., 2022; Weidinger et al., 2021; Gehman et al., 2020). As result, LLMs require alignment with human values and intentions *Equal contribution Work done during internship at Huawei 1Huawei Noahs Ark Lab 2Imperial College London 3University College London. Correspondence to: Haitham Bou Ammar <haitham.ammar@huawei.com>. 1 The traditional LLM alignment approach involves finetuning the model on human-labeled preference data. For instance, works such as (Ouyang et al., 2022; Christiano et al., 2017) use the reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) framework to fine-tune LLMs, constructing reward model from human feedback and optimizing the model using standard reinforcement learning algorithms like PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). More recent approaches, such as (Tutnov et al., 2025; Yin et al., 2024; Rafailov et al., 2023), bypass reward learning and instead align pre-trained models directly with human preferences. RLHF alignment can be costly and risks overfitting partly since they modify the LLMs model weights. To tackle these challenges, alternative approaches adjust the models inference time while leaving the responses directly at pre-trained model weights fixed. Several techniques have been proposed for this purpose, such as Best-of-N (Nakano et al., 2021; Stiennon et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023), FUDGE (Yang & Klein, 2021), COLD (Qin et al., 2022), CD-Q Mudgal et al. (2023), RE-control (Kong et al., 2024), among others. Importantly, those techniques are designed modularly, allowing the alignment module to integrate seamlessly with the pre-trained model. This modularity enables flexible inference-time reconfigurability and quick adaptation to new reward models and datasets. Moreover, it reduces reliance on resource-intensive and often hard-tostabilize RL processes inherent in the RLHF paradigm. Despite the successes of inference-time alignment, these methods safety aspects have received limited attention so far. While some works have attempted to tackle those issues in inference-time-generated responses, they mainly focus on prompt-based alignment (Hua et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024b), trainable safety classifiers (Niu et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2024) or protections against adversarial attacks and jailbreaks (Dong et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2024; Inan et al., 2023). That said, prompt-based methods cannot be guaranteed to consistently produce safe responses, as ensuring safety is heavily reliant on user intervention, requiring extensive engineering and expertise to manage the models output effectively. Trainable classifiers focus only on the safety of decoded responses using hidden states Almost Surely Safe Alignment of Large Language Models at Inference-Time or virtual tokens, ignoring task alignment and lacking theoretical guarantees. Moreover, while adversarial robustness is crucial, our work focuses on the key challenge of generating inherently safe responses from the LLM. to produce probability distribution over the vocabulary space. Moreover, ht comprises all key-value pairs accumulated from previous time steps 1. The system evolves until the end-of-sequence (EOS) token is reached. In this work, we aim to develop LLMs that generate safe responses at inference time, following principled approach that guarantees safety almost surely, i.e., with probability approaching one. To do so, we reformulate the safe generation of inference-time responses as an instance of constrained Markov decision processes (cMDP). We map the cMDP to an unconstrained one through safety state augmentation, bypassing Lagrangian approaches limitations that struggle to balance reward maximization and safety feasibility. Focusing on practical test-time inference algorithm, we adopt critic-based approach to solve the augmented MDP, eliminating the need for gradients in the LLM. To ensure efficiency, we train our critic in the latent space of the LLM, keeping it small in size and fast during inference. This shift to the latent space complicates the theoretical framework, requiring extensions from (HernandezLerma & Munoz de Ozak, 1992; Sootla et al., 2022). By doing so, we establish, for the first time, that one can guarantee almost sure safety in the original token space. To leverage this theoretical guarantee in practice, we build upon the augmented MDP framework and introduce two novel implementations for safe inference-time alignment: one that learns compact critic in the latent space for cases where safety costs can only be queried after the generation of complete responses and another that leverages direct cost queries for efficient inference-time optimization. Finally, we integrate these compone"

Before they can be used in clinical practice, it is essential to ensure they are robust to variations between medical centers. We measure whether pathology FMs focus on biological features like tissue and cancer type, or on the well known confounding medical center signatures introduced by staining procedure and other differences. We introduce the Robustness Index. This novel robustness metric reflects to what degree biological features dominate confounding features. Ten current publicly available pathology FMs are evaluated. We find that all current pathology foundation models evaluated represent the medical center to strong degree. Significant differences in the robustness index are observed. Only one model so far has robustness index greater than one, meaning biological features dominate confounding features, but only slightly. quantitative approach to measure the influence of medical center differences on FM-based prediction performance is described. We analyze the impact of unrobustness on classification performance of downstream models, and find that cancer-type classification errors are not random, but specifically attributable to same-center confounders: images of other classes from the same medical center. We visualize FM embedding spaces, and find these are more strongly organized by medical centers than by biological factors. As consequence, the medical center of origin is predicted more accurately than the tissue source and cancer type.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in reasoning while they still suffer from severe factual hallucinations due to timeliness, accuracy, and coverage of parametric knowledge. Meanwhile, integrating reasoning with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains challenging due to ineffective task decomposition and redundant retrieval, which can introduce noise and degrade response quality. In this paper, we propose DeepRAG, a framework that models retrieval-augmented reasoning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling strategic and adaptive retrieval. By iteratively decomposing queries, DeepRAG dynamically determines whether to retrieve external knowledge or rely on parametric reasoning at each step. Experiments show that DeepRAG improves retrieval efficiency while improving answer accuracy by 21.99%, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Even highly capable large language models (LLMs) can produce biased or unsafe responses, and alignment techniques, such as RLHF, aimed at mitigating this issue, are expensive and prone to overfitting as they retrain the LLM. This paper introduces a novel inference-time alignment approach that ensures LLMs generate safe responses almost surely, i.e., with a probability approaching one. We achieve this by framing the safe generation of inference-time responses as a constrained Markov decision process within the LLM's latent space. Crucially, we augment a safety state that tracks the evolution of safety constraints and enables us to demonstrate formal safety guarantees upon solving the MDP in the latent space. Building on this foundation, we propose InferenceGuard, a practical implementation that safely aligns LLMs without modifying the model weights. Empirically, we demonstrate InferenceGuard effectively balances safety and task performance, outperforming existing inference-time alignment methods in generating safe and aligned responses.

Existing benchmarks for frontier models often test specialized, ``PhD-level'' knowledge that is difficult for non-experts to grasp. In contrast, we present a benchmark based on the NPR Sunday Puzzle Challenge that requires only general knowledge. Our benchmark is challenging for both humans and models, however correct solutions are easy to verify, and models' mistakes are easy to spot.   Our work reveals capability gaps that are not evident in existing benchmarks: OpenAI o1 significantly outperforms other reasoning models that are on par on benchmarks that test specialized knowledge. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning outputs uncovers new kinds of failures. DeepSeek R1, for instance, often concedes with ``I give up'' before providing an answer that it knows is wrong. R1 can also be remarkably ``uncertain'' in its output and in rare cases, it does not ``finish thinking,'' which suggests the need for an inference-time technique to ``wrap up'' before the context window limit is reached. We also quantify the effectiveness of reasoning longer with R1 and Gemini Thinking to identify the point beyond which more reasoning is unlikely to improve accuracy on our benchmark.

"Existing benchmarks for frontier models often test specialized, ``PhD-level'' knowledge that is difficult for non-experts to grasp. In contrast, we present a benchmark based on the NPR Sunday Puzzle Challenge that requires only general knowledge. Our benchmark is challenging for both humans and models, however correct solutions are easy to verify, and models' mistakes are easy to spot.   Our work reveals capability gaps that are not evident in existing benchmarks: OpenAI o1 significantly outperforms other reasoning models that are on par on benchmarks that test specialized knowledge. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning outputs uncovers new kinds of failures. DeepSeek R1, for instance, often concedes with ``I give up'' before providing an answer that it knows is wrong. R1 can also be remarkably ``uncertain'' in its output and in rare cases, it does not ``finish thinking,'' which suggests the need for an inference-time technique to ``wrap up'' before the context window limit is reached. We also quantify the effectiveness of reasoning longer with R1 and Gemini Thinking to identify the point beyond which more reasoning is unlikely to improve accuracy on our benchmark."

Pathology Foundation Models (FMs) hold great promise for healthcare. Before they can be used in clinical practice, it is essential to ensure they are robust to variations between medical centers. We measure whether pathology FMs focus on biological features like tissue and cancer type, or on the well known confounding medical center signatures introduced by staining procedure and other differences. We introduce the Robustness Index. This novel robustness metric reflects to what degree biological features dominate confounding features. Ten current publicly available pathology FMs are evaluated. We find that all current pathology foundation models evaluated represent the medical center to a strong degree. Significant differences in the robustness index are observed. Only one model so far has a robustness index greater than one, meaning biological features dominate confounding features, but only slightly. A quantitative approach to measure the influence of medical center differences on FM-based prediction performance is described. We analyze the impact of unrobustness on classification performance of downstream models, and find that cancer-type classification errors are not random, but specifically attributable to same-center confounders: images of other classes from the same medical center. We visualize FM embedding spaces, and find these are more strongly organized by medical centers than by biological factors. As a consequence, the medical center of origin is predicted more accurately than the tissue source and cancer type. The robustness index introduced here is provided with the aim of advancing progress towards clinical adoption of robust and reliable pathology FMs.
