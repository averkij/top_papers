Text:"FastKV: KV Cache Compression for Fast Long-Context Processing with Token-Selective Propagation Dongwon Jo * 1 Jiwon Song * 1 Yulhwa Kim 2 Jae-Joon Kim 1 5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 8 6 0 1 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aWhile large language models (LLMs) excel at handling long-context sequences, they require substantial key-value (KV) caches to store contextual information, which can heavily burden computational efficiency and memory usage. Previous efforts to compress these KV caches primarily focused on reducing memory demands but were limited in enhancing latency. To address this issue, we introduce FastKV, KV cache compression method designed to enhance latency for long-context sequences. To enhance processing speeds while maintaining accuracy, FastKV adopts novel Token-Selective Propagation (TSP) approach that retains the full context information in the initial layers of LLMs and selectively propagates only portion of this information in deeper layers even in the prefill stage. Additionally, FastKV incorporates grouped-query attention (GQA)-aware KV cache compression to exploit the advantages of GQA in both memory and computational efficiency. Our experimental results show that FastKV achieves 2.00 and 1.40 improvements in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and throughput, respectively, compared to HeadKV, the state-of-the-art KV cache compression method. Moreover, FastKV successfully maintains accuracy on long-context benchmarks at levels comparable to the baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/ dongwonjo/FastKV. 1. Introduction Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the processing of long-context sequences, such as those comprising 128k tokens (Achiam et al., 2023; Gem- *Equal contribution 1Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea 2Department of Semiconductor Systems Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea. Correspondence to: Yulhwa Kim <yulhwakim@skku.edu>, Jae-Joon Kim <kimjaejoon@snu.ac.kr>. Figure 1. Comparison of accuracy, TTFT, throughput across different KV cache compression methods on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct ini Team et al., 2023; Anthropic). This capability significantly broadens the range of applications for LLMs (Yi et al., 2024; Laban et al., 2023; Gu, 2023). However, as the length of the input sequence increases, the size of these keyvalue (KV) caches also increases, making them significant bottleneck in the serving of long-context LLMs. Therefore, compression of KV caches is essential for optimizing the operation of LLMs. There has been active research on compressing KV cache to alleviate its burden in long-context handling (Zhang et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2023; 2024; Oren et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024). Some techniques have demonstrated the ability to preserve accuracy comparable to full-context processing after the compression (Li et al., 2024; Feng et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2024), while there exists compression technique that has achieved inference speedup in both the prefill and generation stages (Shi et al., 2024). However, no KV cache compression techniques currently exist that can simultaneously preserve accuracy and achieve inference speedup, particularly during the prefill stage. In this paper, we propose FastKV, an innovative approach designed to expedite long-context handling with LLMs while maintaining their accuracy. FastKV stems from our finding that the properties of attention maps differ between the early and later layers of LLMs. Through detailed analysis of LLMs, we discover that in the later layers, attention maps concentrate on limited set of significant tokens, which remain consistent across layers. In contrast, the early layers engage with broader array of tokens and exhibit diverse attention patterns as they process the context of the input prmopt. Based on these findings, FastKV adopts novel Token-Selective Propagation (TSP) method that applies difFastKV: KV Cache Compression for Fast Long-Context Processing with Token-Selective Propagation Figure 2. Comparison of the number of tokens processed in each layer/head of LLMs during prefill computation and KV caching across different KV cache compression techniques. As each token produces its corresponding KV, the KV cache size is directly proportional to the number of tokens processed. The blue background box indicates the set of sharing selected token indices. ferent strategies of KV cache compression at the early and later layers respectively As shown in Figure 1, this dualstrategy approach enables FastKV to improve both time-tofirst-token (TTFT) and throughput of long-context processing while effectively preserves the accuracy of LLMs. Our experimental results show that FastKV can achieve 2.00 speedup for TTFT and 1.40 improvement for throughput compared to HeadKV, while maintaining similar level of accuracy with less than 1% accuracy gap. These results demonstrate that FastKV promises practical solution for long context scenarios, particularly in real-time applications that require efficient KV cache management and low latency for the prefill and generation stages. 2. Background 2.1. Long-Context Processing with LLMs LLMs have significantly enhanced the natural language processing (NLP) abilities of AI systems (Brown et al., 2020; Radford, 2018; Kamalloo et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2021) through the use of attention mechanisms (Vaswani, 2017). These attention mechanisms carefully evaluate the relationships between tokens within sentences to construct context vectors by aggregating token data according to the attention scores to extract context-specific information (Brauwers & Frasincar, 2021). Distinct from earlier NLP models such as RNNs (Sherstinsky, 2020) and LSTMs (Hochreiter, 1997), attention mechanisms consider the entire token data from input sequences, thereby avoiding issues of prompt forgetting. Benefiting from these advancements, recent researches indicates that LLMs are capable of processing long-context sequences. However, the very nature of LLMs, which retain all token data to facilitate attention mechanisms, leads to significant memory overhead. Typically, token data for attention mechanisms are stored in the form of KV cache, and the size of KV cache escalates with sequence length, becoming primary source of inefficiency in LLMs when processing long-context scenarios. For instance, in the LLaMA-3.18B model (Dubey et al., 2024), managing sequence of 128k tokens requires 17.12GB of memory"

Text:"Preference Leakage: Contamination Problem in LLM-as-a-judge Dawei Li * 1 Renliang Sun * 2 Yue Huang 3 Ming Zhong 4 Bohan Jiang 1 Jiawei Han 4 Xiangliang Zhang 3 Wei Wang 2 Huan Liu 1 Abstract Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges and LLM-based data synthesis have emerged as two fundamental LLM-driven data annotation methods in model development. While their combination significantly enhances the efficiency of model training and evaluation, little attention has been given to the potential contamination brought by this new model development paradigm. In this work, we expose preference leakage, contamination problem in LLM-as-a-judge caused by the relatedness between the synthetic data generators and LLM-based evaluators. To study this issue, we first define three common relatednesses between data generator LLM and judge LLM: being the same model, having an inheritance relationship, and belonging to the same model family. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm the bias of judges towards their related student models caused by preference leakage across multiple LLM baselines and benchmarks. Further analysis suggests that preference leakage is pervasive issue that is harder to detect compared to previously identified biases in LLM-as-a-judge scenarios. All of these findings imply that preference leakage is widespread and challenging problem in the area of LLMas-a-judge.

Text:"Akshat Gupta 1 Phudish Prateepamornkul 1 2 Maochuan Lu 1 Ahmed Alaa 1 Thomas Hartvigsen 3 Gopala AnumanchipalliPrior work in parameter-modifying knowledge editing has shown that large-scale sequential editing leads to significant model degradation. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this and scale sequential knowledge editing to 10,000 sequential edits, while maintaining the downstream performance of the original model. We first show that locate-then-edit knowledge editing methods lead to overfitting on the edited facts. We also show that continuous knowledge editing using these methods leads to disproportionate growth in the norm of the edited matrix. We then provide crucial insight into the inner workings of locatethen-edit methods. We show that norm-growth is hidden trick employed by these methods that gives larger importance to the output activations produced from the edited layers. With this importance hacking, the edited layers provide much larger contributions to the models output. To mitigate these issues, we present ENCORE - Early stopping and Norm-Constrained Robust knowledge Editing. ENCORE controls for overfitting and the disproportionate norm-growth to enable long-term sequential editing, where we are able to perform up to 10,000 sequential edits without loss of downstream performance. ENCORE is also 61% faster than MEMIT and 64% faster than AlphaEdit on Llama3-8B. 5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 6 3 6 1 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r 1. Introduction Knowledge editing is the task of editing specific facts that model learns during pretraining in data and computing efficient manner (De Cao et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2023; Hartvigsen et al., 2024). In this paper, we focus on category of parameter-modifying knowledge editing methods 1University of California, Berkeley 2 SCB DataX 3University Correspondence to: Akshat Gupta <akof Virginia. shat.gupta@berkeley.edu>. can be Code scalable-model-editing/encore found here - https://github.com/ (a) MEMIT (b) AlphaEdit Figure 1. The continuous growth of norm of edited MLP matrices in LLama3-8B during sequential knowledge editing, as function of number edits. called locate-then-edit methods, which modify only small subset of the model parameters to add or update knowledge. These methods have been the focus of many recent works (Gu et al., 2024; Gupta et al., 2024a;c; Ma et al., 2024; Kolbeinsson et al., 2024; Fang et al., 2024). While prior work showed knowledge editing methods like ROME (Meng et al., 2022a) and MEMIT (Meng et al., 2022b) lead to catastophic loss of downstream performance within few hundred sequential edits (Gu et al., 2024; Gupta et al., 2024b), recently introduced method called AlphaEdit (Fang et al., 2024) has been able to push this to 3000 edits. In this paper, we aim to enable large-scale sequential knowledge editing without causing model degradation. Towards this goal, we push sequential knowledge editing to what we propose as the next frontier - performing 10,000 sequential knowledge edits without loss of downstream performance. Our work is based on two main observations. Firstly, we show that existing locate-then-edit knowledge editing methods are prone to overfitting on the edited fact, where the output probability of an edited fact is unusually higher when compared to the confidence with which an unedited model predicts facts. Secondly, we show that sequential knowledge updates made to model consistently lead to an increase in the norm of the weight matrix being edited, as shown in Figure 1. We show that this norm-growth is secret trick used by locate-then-edit methods, which we call importance hacking. The increasing norm of the edited matrix also increases the norm of the activation vectors produced by the edited layers on average. This allows the outputs produced from the edited layers to have larger influence 1 Lifelong Sequential Knowledge Editing without Model Degradation on the final output of the model. With this, the edited layers are able to override the information coming from other parts of the model, leading to successful knowledge edits but inadvertently causing loss of general ability, which might require information coming from other parts of the model. Based on these observations, we present targeted interventions to overcome the limitations of overfitting on edited facts and disproportionate norm growth. We first formalize locate-then-edit methods as two-step finetuning process, where the first step uses gradient descent for optimization and the second step directly optimizes the loss using least-square objective. This way of understanding knowledge editing enable us to apply appropriate interventions depending on the optimization scenario. To mitigate overfitting during the gradient descent process, we propose Most-Probable Early Stopping (MPES) - where we halt gradient descent when edited facts become most probable across all the different contexts used to calculate the loss. MPES reduces overfitting on edited facts and consequently improves editing performance while reducing loss of downstream performance. To counteract the growth of the norm of the edited matrix during sequential knowledge editing, we add frobenius-norm constraint within the knowledge editing objective of locate-then-edit methods (Meng et al., 2022b). This constraint still allows for closed-form solution and gives us the benefits of computationally efficient knowledge edits while allowing us to control the increasing norm of edited weight matrices, thus enabling longer and more robust sequential knowledge editing. Towards large-scale sequential knowledge editing, we present ENCORE - Early stopping and Norm-Constrained Robust knowledge Editing. ENCORE combines MPES with Frobenius-norm constrained objective and enables performing 10,000 sequential knowledge edits while maintaining the downstream performance of the original unedited model. ENCORE significantly outperforms prior locatethen-edit methods like ROME, MEMIT, and AlphaEdit, as verified on GPT2-XL, Llama-2-7B, and Llama-3-8B, and is significantly faster than its predecessors. Specifically, ENCORE is 61% faster than MEMIT and 64% faster than AlphaEdit when editing Llama3-8B. 2. Background and Related Work In this section, we provide brief introduction to locate-thenedit knowledge editing methods and present them as twostep fine-tuning process. For more detailed introduction to these methods, we refer the reader to prior works (Meng et al., 2022a;b; Gupta et al., 2024c). Locate-th"

Text:"Da Yu Edith Cohen Badih Ghazi Yangsibo Huang Pritish Kamath Ravi Kumar Daogao Liu Chiyuan Zhang 5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 7 3 6 1 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aWe propose SCONE (Scalable, Contextualized, Offloaded, N-gram Embedding), method for extending input embedding layers to enhance language model performance as layer size scales. To avoid increased decoding costs, SCONE retains the original vocabulary while introducing embeddings for set of frequent n-grams. These embeddings provide contextualized representation for each input token and are learned with separate model during training. During inference, they are precomputed and stored in off-accelerator memory with minimal impact on inference speed. SCONE enables two new scaling strategies: increasing the number of cached n-gram embeddings and scaling the model used to learn them, all while maintaining fixed inference-time FLOPS. We show that scaling both aspects allows SCONE to outperform 1.9B parameter baseline across diverse corpora, while using only half the inferencetime FLOPS. 1. Introduction Embedding layers in language models map discrete tokens to continuous vector representations (Mikolov, 2013; Sennrich et al., 2016). These layers can be implemented as lookup tables, enabling efficient retrieval of embeddings using hashor tree-based data structures. This allows embedding layers to be offloaded to main memory or even secondary storage (e.g., disk) with minimal impact on inference speed. This is desirable, as main memory and secondary storage are significantly more cost-effective than accelerators (e.g., GPUs and TPUs (McCallum, 2024)). These advantages drive our exploration of methods for scaling up embedding layers. However, scaling the embedding layer by simply increasing the vocabulary size has limited benefits. The first issue is the coupling between the input embedding layer and the output Google. Correspondence to: {dayuwork,edco,pritishk,chiyuan}@google.com. Figure 1. (Top) Perplexity (lower is better) on the OLMo (Groeneveld et al., 2024) evaluation mixture. Inference-time FLOPS refer to the forward pass computation cost for four model sizes (0.7B, 1B, 1.3B, and 1.9B). With 10M f-grams, the 1.3B model matches the 1.9B baseline, while with 1B f-grams, the 1B model surpasses it. (Bottom) End-to-end token generation speed on single A100 using vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023). Storing f-gram embeddings in main memory introduces negligible latency, while NVMe storage slows generation slightly but does not create bottleneck. (logits) layer: (i) It is common to share weights between the input embedding and the output layer. In this case, the weights already reside in the accelerator memory as they are needed for logits computation, which eliminates the benefits of offloading the input embedding. (ii) Even when the weight parameters are not shared, the weight shapes are tied to the vocabulary size and embedding dimension. When scaling the input embedding by increasing the vocabularyFigure 2. Illustration of SCONE (with maximum n-gram length of 3). The term f-grams refers to the set of frequent n-grams (Section 3). size, as explored in prior studies (Wang et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2023; Tao et al., 2024), the inference cost also increases due to the size growth of the output embedding that is used to compute logits (Dagan et al., 2024). This scaling becomes computationally impractical beyond vocabulary size of few hundred thousands. The second issue is that the benefits of scaling the vocabulary diminish, even when computational costs can be mitigated by advances in accelerators or smarter algorithms (Joulin et al., 2017; Shim et al., 2017): Scaling leads to large number of tail tokens, that have low frequency in the training corpus. The training of their (input and output) embeddings receives very few updates which results in representations that are of lower quality (Liao et al., 2021; Dou et al., 2024). Our experiments with GPT-2 models (Radford et al., 2019) pre-trained on WebText (Peterson et al., 2019) confirm these limitations: Only 7.3% of embedding vectors in 2M vocabulary receive more than 100 updates over 100M training tokens, compared to 97.6% for 32K vocabulary. Additionally, we observe performance degradation and linear increase in accelerator memory usage when the vocabulary size exceeds 1M (Appendix C). Our contributions. In this paper we propose novel approach to disentangle the input and output embeddings, bypassing those issues and enabling the effective input embedding scaling with minimal additional inference cost. Instead of increasing the size of the vocabulary, we augment each token in the base vocabulary with n-gram contextualized variants. The n-grams are selected from predefined set of frequently occurring n-grams, that we refer to as f-grams. Those contextualized tokens are only used in input embedding computation, allowing us to build an augmented input embedding table with billions of entries without impacting the computation cost of the output layer. Furthermore, the embeddings for those contextualized tokens are generated from an embedding transformer model, referred to as f-gram model, that is jointly trained (see Figure 2 for an illustration). This allows us to obtain rich contextualized representations without being subjected to the sparse tail phenomenon of naively increasing the vocabulary size. With this novel design, we introduce two new directions for improving model performance: (i) increasing the number of cached f-gram embeddings and (ii) scaling up the f-gram model for learning those embeddings. Notably, both approaches preserve inference-time FLOPs. These directions enable us to fully leverage the precomputation and offloading of contextualized embeddings. We demonstrate that 1B parameter model with SCONE outperforms baseline model requiring 2 more inference-time FLOPs. Figure 1 presents representative results from Section 4.2. To summarize, our contributions are as follows: We propose SCONE, scalable approach to expand the embedding layer in language models (Section 3). We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate design choices and validate our method in large-scale pre-training setups (Section 4). 2. Preliminaries We focus on pre-training decoder-only language models using the causal language modeling objective, standard recipe to train modern language models (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). This involves predicting the next token based solely on preceding tokens"

[ 1 1 9 5 1 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r We present an approach to model-based RL that achieves new state of the art performance on the challenging Craftax-classic benchmark, an open-world 2D survival game that requires agents to exhibit wide range of general abilitiessuch as strong generalization, deep exploration, and long-term reasoning. With series of careful design choices aimed at improving sample efficiency, our MBRL algorithm achieves reward of 67.42% after only 1M environment steps, significantly outperforming DreamerV3, which achieves 53.2%, and, for the first time, exceeds human performance of 65.0%. Our method starts by constructing SOTA model-free baseline, using novel policy architecture that combines CNNs and RNNs. We then add three improvements to the standard MBRL setup: (a) Dyna with warmup, which trains the policy on real and imaginary data, (b) nearest neighbor tokenizer on image patches, which improves the scheme to create the transformer world model (TWM) inputs, and (c) block teacher forcing, which allows the TWM to reason jointly about the future tokens of the next timestep. 1. Introduction Reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton and Barto, 2018) provides framework for training agents to act in environments so as to maximize their rewards. Online RL algorithms interleave taking actions in the environmentcollecting observations and rewardsand updating the policy using the collected experience. Online RL algorithms often employ model-free approach (MFRL), where the agent learns direct mapping from observations to actions, but this can require lot of data to be collected from the environment.

While large language models (LLMs) excel at handling long-context sequences, they require substantial key-value (KV) caches to store contextual information, which can heavily burden computational efficiency and memory usage. Previous efforts to compress these KV caches primarily focused on reducing memory demands but were limited in enhancing latency. To address this issue, we introduce FastKV, a KV cache compression method designed to enhance latency for long-context sequences. To enhance processing speeds while maintaining accuracy, FastKV adopts a novel Token-Selective Propagation (TSP) approach that retains the full context information in the initial layers of LLMs and selectively propagates only a portion of this information in deeper layers even in the prefill stage. Additionally, FastKV incorporates grouped-query attention (GQA)-aware KV cache compression to exploit the advantages of GQA in both memory and computational efficiency. Our experimental results show that FastKV achieves 2.00times and 1.40times improvements in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and throughput, respectively, compared to HeadKV, the state-of-the-art KV cache compression method. Moreover, FastKV successfully maintains accuracy on long-context benchmarks at levels comparable to the baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/dongwonjo/FastKV.

End-to-end human animation, such as audio-driven talking human generation, has undergone notable advancements in the recent few years. However, existing methods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models, limiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose OmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by mixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we introduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the corresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable OmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving highly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body), supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to existing end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more realistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also supports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined driving signals). Video samples are provided on the ttfamily project page (https://omnihuman-lab.github.io)

"End-to-end human animation, such as audio-driven talking human generation, has undergone notable advancements in the recent few years. However, existing methods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models, limiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose OmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by mixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we introduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the corresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable OmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving highly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body), supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to existing end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more realistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also supports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined driving signals). Video samples are provided on the ttfamily project page (https://omnihuman-lab.github.io)"

Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges and LLM-based data synthesis have emerged as two fundamental LLM-driven data annotation methods in model development. While their combination significantly enhances the efficiency of model training and evaluation, little attention has been given to the potential contamination brought by this new model development paradigm. In this work, we expose preference leakage, a contamination problem in LLM-as-a-judge caused by the relatedness between the synthetic data generators and LLM-based evaluators. To study this issue, we first define three common relatednesses between data generator LLM and judge LLM: being the same model, having an inheritance relationship, and belonging to the same model family. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm the bias of judges towards their related student models caused by preference leakage across multiple LLM baselines and benchmarks. Further analysis suggests that preference leakage is a pervasive issue that is harder to detect compared to previously identified biases in LLM-as-a-judge scenarios. All of these findings imply that preference leakage is a widespread and challenging problem in the area of LLM-as-a-judge. We release all codes and data at: https://github.com/David-Li0406/Preference-Leakage.

Prior work in parameter-modifying knowledge editing has shown that large-scale sequential editing leads to significant model degradation. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this and scale sequential knowledge editing to 10,000 sequential edits, while maintaining the downstream performance of the original model. We first show that locate-then-edit knowledge editing methods lead to overfitting on the edited facts. We also show that continuous knowledge editing using these methods leads to disproportionate growth in the norm of the edited matrix. We then provide a crucial insight into the inner workings of locate-then-edit methods. We show that norm-growth is a hidden trick employed by these methods that gives larger importance to the output activations produced from the edited layers. With this "importance hacking", the edited layers provide a much larger contributions to the model's output. To mitigate these issues, we present ENCORE - Early stopping and Norm-Constrained Robust knowledge Editing. ENCORE controls for overfitting and the disproportionate norm-growth to enable long-term sequential editing, where we are able to perform up to 10,000 sequential edits without loss of downstream performance. ENCORE is also 61% faster than MEMIT and 64% faster than AlphaEdit on Llama3-8B.

We investigate the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and their scalability in complex non-monotonic reasoning. To this end, we introduce ZebraLogic, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing LLM reasoning performance on logic grid puzzles derived from constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). ZebraLogic enables the generation of puzzles with controllable and quantifiable complexity, facilitating a systematic study of the scaling limits of models such as Llama, o1 models, and DeepSeek-R1. By encompassing a broad range of search space complexities and diverse logical constraints, ZebraLogic provides a structured environment to evaluate reasoning under increasing difficulty.   Our results reveal a significant decline in accuracy as problem complexity grows -- a phenomenon we term the curse of complexity. This limitation persists even with larger models and increased inference-time computation, suggesting inherent constraints in current LLM reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we explore strategies to enhance logical reasoning, including Best-of-N sampling, backtracking mechanisms, and self-verification prompts. Our findings offer critical insights into the scalability of LLM reasoning, highlight fundamental limitations, and outline potential directions for improvement.

"We investigate the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and their scalability in complex non-monotonic reasoning. To this end, we introduce ZebraLogic, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing LLM reasoning performance on logic grid puzzles derived from constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). ZebraLogic enables the generation of puzzles with controllable and quantifiable complexity, facilitating a systematic study of the scaling limits of models such as Llama, o1 models, and DeepSeek-R1. By encompassing a broad range of search space complexities and diverse logical constraints, ZebraLogic provides a structured environment to evaluate reasoning under increasing difficulty.   Our results reveal a significant decline in accuracy as problem complexity grows -- a phenomenon we term the curse of complexity. This limitation persists even with larger models and increased inference-time computation, suggesting inherent constraints in current LLM reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we explore strategies to enhance logical reasoning, including Best-of-N sampling, backtracking mechanisms, and self-verification prompts. Our findings offer critical insights into the scalability of LLM reasoning, highlight fundamental limitations, and outline potential directions for improvement."

The releases of OpenAI's o1 and o3 mark a significant paradigm shift in Large Language Models towards advanced reasoning capabilities. Notably, o3 outperformed humans in novel problem-solving and skill acquisition on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI). However, this benchmark is limited to symbolic patterns, whereas humans often perceive and reason about multimodal scenarios involving both vision and language data. Thus, there is an urgent need to investigate advanced reasoning capabilities in multimodal tasks. To this end, we track the evolution of the GPT-[n] and o-[n] series models on challenging multimodal puzzles, requiring fine-grained visual perception with abstract or algorithmic reasoning. The superior performance of o1 comes at nearly 750 times the computational cost of GPT-4o, raising concerns about its efficiency. Our results reveal a clear upward trend in reasoning capabilities across model iterations, with notable performance jumps across GPT-series models and subsequently to o1. Nonetheless, we observe that the o1 model still struggles with simple multimodal puzzles requiring abstract reasoning. Furthermore, its performance in algorithmic puzzles remains poor. We plan to continuously track new models in the series and update our results in this paper accordingly. All resources used in this evaluation are openly available https://github.com/declare-lab/LLM-PuzzleTest.

We propose SCONE (Scalable, Contextualized, Offloaded, N-gram Embedding), a method for extending input embedding layers to enhance language model performance as layer size scales. To avoid increased decoding costs, SCONE retains the original vocabulary while introducing embeddings for a set of frequent n-grams. These embeddings provide contextualized representation for each input token and are learned with a separate model during training. During inference, they are precomputed and stored in off-accelerator memory with minimal impact on inference speed. SCONE enables two new scaling strategies: increasing the number of cached n-gram embeddings and scaling the model used to learn them, all while maintaining fixed inference-time FLOPS. We show that scaling both aspects allows SCONE to outperform a 1.9B parameter baseline across diverse corpora, while using only half the inference-time FLOPS.

We present an approach to model-based RL that achieves a new state of the art performance on the challenging Craftax-classic benchmark, an open-world 2D survival game that requires agents to exhibit a wide range of general abilities -- such as strong generalization, deep exploration, and long-term reasoning. With a series of careful design choices aimed at improving sample efficiency, our MBRL algorithm achieves a reward of 67.4% after only 1M environment steps, significantly outperforming DreamerV3, which achieves 53.2%, and, for the first time, exceeds human performance of 65.0%. Our method starts by constructing a SOTA model-free baseline, using a novel policy architecture that combines CNNs and RNNs. We then add three improvements to the standard MBRL setup: (a) "Dyna with warmup", which trains the policy on real and imaginary data, (b) "nearest neighbor tokenizer" on image patches, which improves the scheme to create the transformer world model (TWM) inputs, and (c) "block teacher forcing", which allows the TWM to reason jointly about the future tokens of the next timestep.
