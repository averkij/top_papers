Text:"5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 6 2 1 1 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Language Models Prefer What They Know: Relative Confidence Estimation via Confidence Preferencesvshrivas@cs.stanford.edu ananya@cs.stanford.edu pliang@cs.stanford.eduLanguage models (LMs) should provide reliable confidence estimates to help users detect mistakes in their outputs and defer to human experts when necessary. Asking language model to assess its confidence (Score your confidence from 0-1.) is natural way of evaluating its uncertainty. However, models struggle to provide absolute assessments of confidence (i.e. judging confidence in answering question independent of other questions) and the coarse-grained scores they produce are not useful for evaluating the correctness of their answers. We propose relative confidence estimation, where we match up questions against each other and ask the model to make relative judgments of confidence (Which question are you more confident in answering correctly?). Treating each question as player in series of matchups against other questions and the models preferences as match outcomes, we can use rank aggregation methods like Elo rating and Bradley-Terry to translate the models confidence preferences into confidence scores. We evaluate relative confidence estimation against absolute confidence estimation and self-consistency confidence methods on five state-of-the-art LMsGPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3.1 405Bacross 14 challenging STEM, social science, and commonsense reasoning question answering tasks. Our results demonstrate that relative confidence estimation consistently provides more reliable confidence scores than absolute confidence estimation, with average gains of 3.5% in selective classification AUC over direct absolute confidence estimation methods and 1.7% over self-consistency approaches across all models and datasets.To ensure users can make informed decisions when interpreting outputs from language models (LMs), it is crucial to develop methods for accurately gauging their confidence. Language models are widely deployed, yet they remain prone to errors in their outputs. For instance, even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 405B struggle to solve challenging datasets such as GPQA (Rein et al., 2023) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b). To help users detect mistakes in their generations, models should provide reliable confidence estimates, signaling when their responses are more likely to be incorrect. By leveraging these estimates, users can disregard low-confidence answers or seek expert opinions. Since users primarily engage with chatbots like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) through language, asking language models to gauge their confidence is natural tool. straightforward approach to this is absolute confidence estimationasking the model to directly rate its confidence without further context or grounding, e.g., How confident are you on scale of 0-1? However, Shrivastava et al. (2023) find that absolute confidences can be too coarse-grained and lack discriminative power. For example, GPT-4 produces the same confidence score of 0.9 for 50% of examples across 12 datasets, limiting its ability to distinguish between correct and 1 Figure 1: Relative Confidence Estimation. We first prompt models to elicit their answers to different questions. For each question qi, we match qi with other questions qj and generate confidence preference data. We ask the model to compare its level of confidence in the pair of questions and decide which question it is more confident in answering correctly. We treat the questions and answers as players in these matchups and the confidence preferences as match outcomes. Leveraging rank aggregation techniques used in competitive games, such as Elo rating, we translate the models confidence preferences into confidence scores. incorrect answers. This may be due to lack of realistic examples of confidence estimation in training data. For example, Zhou et al. (2023) find that many examples in the Pile dataset use hyperbolic terms like am 100% confident, rather than providing more nuanced estimates. We introduce relative confidence estimation, as an alternative to absolute confidence estimation. Rather than asking models to rate their confidence on an answer to single question, we ask them to compare confidence across different questions: Which question are you more confident in answering correctly?. Relative comparisons are used in many scenarios as an easier alternative to absolute judgments. For instance, in RLHF, annotators assess which generation is better, rather than assigning direct scores (Ouyang et al., 2022). Kadavath et al. (2022) also show that LMs are better at making relative judgments of correctness by comparing multiple sampled outputs, rather than verifying single generation. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to explore confidence estimation through relative comparisons. Figure 1 illustrates our method. To estimate confidence for language models answers to questions q1, q2, ..., qn, we generate confidence preference data by pairing each question qi with another question qj and asking the model, Which question are you more confident in answering correctly, qi or qj? We repeat this times for each question to gather pairwise confidence preferences. We then convert these preferences into confidence scores, treating this as rank aggregation problemdetermining scores or rankings from set of partial and potentially inconsistent comparisons. Leveraging well-established solutions to rank aggregation like Elo rating (Elo, 1978), Bradley-Terry (Bradley & Terry, 1952), and TrueSkill (Herbrich et al., 2006), we translate these relative judgments of confidence into confidence scores. We compare relative confidence estimation to state-of-the-art absolute confidence estimation methods. For absolute confidence estimates, we study direct promptingeliciting model confidence through single promptand self-consistency promptingrepeatedly prompting the model for its confidence and aggregating the results into single score through post-processing (Xiong et al., 2023). Our goal is to produce reliable confidence estimates that can allow users to detect potentially incorrect answers from the model, so we study the selective classification AUC which measures how accurate the model is if it is allowed to abstain on some (low-confidence) examples. Additionally, we also report the AUROC  (Table 7)  to understand how wel"

Language models (LMs) should provide reliable confidence estimates to help users detect mistakes in their outputs and defer to human experts when necessary. Asking a language model to assess its confidence ("Score your confidence from 0-1.") is a natural way of evaluating its uncertainty. However, models struggle to provide absolute assessments of confidence (i.e. judging confidence in answering a question independent of other questions) and the coarse-grained scores they produce are not useful for evaluating the correctness of their answers. We propose relative confidence estimation, where we match up questions against each other and ask the model to make relative judgments of confidence ("Which question are you more confident in answering correctly?"). Treating each question as a "player" in a series of matchups against other questions and the model's preferences as match outcomes, we can use rank aggregation methods like Elo rating and Bradley-Terry to translate the model's confidence preferences into confidence scores. We evaluate relative confidence estimation against absolute confidence estimation and self-consistency confidence methods on five state-of-the-art LMs -- GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3.1 405B -- across 14 challenging STEM, social science, and commonsense reasoning question answering tasks. Our results demonstrate that relative confidence estimation consistently provides more reliable confidence scores than absolute confidence estimation, with average gains of 3.5% in selective classification AUC over direct absolute confidence estimation methods and 1.7% over self-consistency approaches across all models and datasets.
