Text:"6 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 4 2 1 1 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI Tianyi Xiong1*, Shihao Wang, Guilin Liu, Yi Dong, Ming Li1, Heng Huang1, Jan Kautz, Zhiding YuWith the rapid development of large multimodal models, reliable judge and critic models have become essential for open-ended evaluation and preference alignment, providing pairwise preferences, numerical scores, and explanatory justifications for assessing model-generated responses. However, existing critics are primarily trained in general visual domains such as captioning or image question answering, leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning largely underexplored. We introduce PhyCritic, multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through two-stage RLVR pipeline: physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks. Links: Project Page 1. Introduction Physical AI has emerged as new frontier that involves visual perception, physical commonsense, spatial reasoning, and action-centric decision making within single computational framework. Unlike traditional visual recognition tasks, physical AI requires model to interpret complex multi-view observations, understand object affordances, reason over causal dynamics, and assess how hypothetical actions unfold in real environments. This paradigm spans 3D perception and spatial grounding Zhang et al. (2025), robot-centric interaction understanding Bu et al. (2025); Sermanet et al. (2024); Walke et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023), and safetycritical domains such as autonomous driving Marcu et al. (2024); Nie et al. (2024); Sima et al. (2024); Xie et al. (2025). As these systems grow in scale and autonomy, the community increasingly relies on multimodal evaluation to measure whether models reasoning is physically correct, visually grounded, and aligned with human expectations. However, despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the development of reliable multimodal critic modelsmodels that evaluate other models outputslags far behind. Existing reward or judge models focus predominantly on general domains such as captioning, STEM reasoning, and image question answering Lee et al. (2024); Wang et al. (2025,, 2026); Xiong et al. (2025); Zhang et al. (2025). Yet, evaluation in physical AI is fundamentally different: the critic must assess whether reasoning is causally valid, whether visual explanation adheres to actual physical configurations, and whether the final answer respects temporal, spatial, and dynamical constraints. Recent works have started to extend multimodal judges and RL-based critic training Wang et al. (2025,); Zhang et al. (2025) to physical-related scenarios, while early efforts such as DriveCritic Song et al. (2025) underscore the importance of domain-specific judgment capabilities. But existing critics remain limited in three essential ways. (1) They lack physics awareness, often failing to distinguish visually coherent but physically impossible reasoning. (2) Their training data focuses on broad multimodal evaluation rather than physically grounded scenarios involving manipulation, affordance reasoning, or embodied 3D interactions. (3) They do not ground * Work done during an internship at NVIDIA. Corresponding author: zhidingy@nvidia.com. Additional affiliations: 1 University of Maryland, College Park. 2026 NVIDIA.

PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI Figure 1: PhyCritic first produces its own physics-aware reasoning and prediction, then explicitly applies it as reference in judging pair of model responses. In this example, PhyCritic first infers in its own prediction that the oven is closed". Based on this insight, the model then correctly identifies Response 1 as following the proper causal sequence while Response 2 proposes an unnecessary action. This self-referential process leads to more stable, physically correct judgments. their decisions in their own physical understanding of the question, which potentially leads to inconsistent or superficial verdicts. In contrast, recent advances in reinforcement-finetuned multimodal policy models show that RLVR-style verifiable rewards Huang et al. (2025); Liu et al. (2025); Shen et al. (2025); Yu et al. (2025) and physically grounded reasoning datasets Azzolini et al. (2025) can significantly improve multimodal reasoning and temporal consistency. Yet, these insights have not been systematically transferred to physical-related critic models, especially in settings where judgments must reflect physical truth rather than linguistic form. Our goal. We propose to bridge this gap by developing new class of multimodal critics specifically designed for physical AI. Our model, called PhyCritic, aims to evaluate multimodal responses involving physical perception, causal reasoning, and action or plan assessment, and to do so in manner that is grounded, stable, and physically correct. As shown in Fig. 1, PhyCritic introduces the principle that strong physical critic should behave like an expert human judge: before evaluating other models responses, it should first solve the problem itself. This intuition motivates self-referential critic finetuning, two-stage reinforcement training framework: Stage 1: we apply standard GRPO on small set of physical-related questionanswer pairs to strengthen the models core physical perception and reasoning abilities, serving as warm-up phase. Stage 2: Building upon the Stage-1 warm-up, the critic is trained to (i) generate its own internal reasoning and prediction for the question, and then (ii) evaluate candidate responses with explicit reference to this self-prediction. Using GRPO with both critic and self-prediction rewards encourages stable critic behavior and coherent physics-aware reasoning. new benchmark for physical critics. To rigorously evaluate judgment performance in physical contexts, we introduce PhyCritic-Bench, novel benchmark explicitly targeting multimodal critic"

[ 1 9 8 4 8 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently strengthened LLM reasoning, but its focus on final-answer correctness leaves critical gap: it does not ensure the robustness of the reasoning process itself. We adopt simple philosophical viewrobust reasoning should remain useful beyond the mind that produced itand treat reasoning as form of meaning transfer that must survive truncation, reinterpretation, and continuation. Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final-answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps. For example, on MATH-500, RLTR achieves +3.6%p gain in Maj@64 compared to RLVR and matches RLVRs average accuracy with roughly 2.5 fewer training steps, providing both more reliable reasoning and significantly more sample-efficient. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) combined with reinforcement learning (RL) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, such as solving complex mathematical problems (Shao et al., 2024), serving as coding assistants (Le et al., 2022), and contributing to scientific discoveries (Romera-Paredes et al., 2024). Compared with simple supervised fine-tuning, RL enables LLMs to learn more generalizable and robust behaviors (Ouyang et al., 2022). However, the success of RL in LLMs is ofWork done during an internship at Microsoft Research Asia 1KAIST 2Microsoft Research. Correspondence to: Soheil Abbasloo <soheil.abbasloo@microsoft.com>. Preprint. ten bottlenecked by its heavy reliance on reward models. While reward models reduce the need for costly human annotations, they introduce critical challenges such as reward hacking (Skalse et al., 2022) and increased training complexity (Casper et al., 2023). To tackle this issue, reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) has recently emerged (Shao et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025). RLVR replaces learned reward models with rule-based verification of the correctness of final answers, which significantly simplifies the training pipeline and alleviates reward hacking and the need for extensive human annotations. As result, RLVR achieves remarkable success on complex reasoning tasks, especially in competitive math domains. Yet despite these gains, RLVR optimizes reasoning solely through final-answer correctness, leaving critical dimension of reasoning quality underexplored: the robustness of the reasoning process itself. In real-world and practical settings, models that consistently produce correct answers across different sampled solutions, decoding variations, or reasoning paths are far more valuable than models that succeed only sporadically. However, RLVRs objective evaluates only the generators final output, providing no incentive for intermediate reasoning to be robust, reusable, or stable under such perturbations. Prior work has observed that the model loses consistency and diversity as more samples are generated, suggesting that final-outcome correctness alone may be an incomplete signal for promoting reliable reasoning behavior (Yue et al., 2025). To move beyond outcome-only evaluation, we draw inspiration from human learning: strong reasoning is not merely correctit is also explainable in way that others can reliably follow. This motivates our central concept, reasoning transferability, defined as the extent to which reasoning prefix produced by one model can be completed by another model to reach verifiably correct answer. We operationalize this idea by truncating generators reasoning trace and asking separate receiver model to continue it; transfer succeeds when the combined reasoning yields correct final answer. Building on this principle, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), new reinforcement learning framework that explicitly optimizes cross-model reasoning transferability. The core mechanism is transfer reward that evaluates generators partial reasoning via receiver-model continuation, integrated into Beyond Correctness: Learning Robust Reasoning via Transfer RLVR through transfer roll-out procedure and weighted combination of answer, transfer, and format rewards. To our knowledge, RLTR is the first RLVR framework that directly incentivizes LLMs to produce reasoning traces that are transferable across models. An overview of RLTR is shown in Figure 1. We demonstrated the effectiveness of RLTR through extensive evaluations on multiple reasoning datasets covering wide range of difficulties across mathematical and scientific domains. Overall, RLTR consistently improves Majority Voting at (Maj@K), proxy for multi-sample consistency, while also improving average accuracy. For instance, on AMC23 (MAA, 2023), RLTR improves Maj@64 from 61.7 to 67.5 compared to RLVR. Across training, RLTR achieves the same average accuracy level with about 2.5 fewer training steps than RLVR on MATH-500, indicating faster learning and improved sample efficiency. Finally, we show transferability correlates with multi-sample consistency by tracking transferability and Maj@K throughout training. We highlight the main contributions of the paper below: We introduce RLTR, simple extension of RLVR that adds transfer reward to optimize reasoning transferability across models. We demonstrate that RLTR increases consistency, as shown by higher majority voting accuracy, which reflects more robust reasoning compared to RLVR. Our training framework improves training sample efficiency e.g., RLTR matches RLVRs performance with 2.5 fewer training steps and improved average accuracy on MATH-500. 2.

We attribute this to fundamental architectural flaw: standard LLMs operate as malloc-only engines, continuously accumulating valid and redundant steps alike without mechanism to prune obsolete information. To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining compact and noise-free state. Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B). It achieves 3.3% average improvement over top-tier reasoning baselines, even establishing new SOTA on IMOanswerBench using DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale. Most notably, in long-horizon tasks where the standard Qwen3-235B-A22B model suffers total collapse (0% accuracy), Free()LM restores performance to 50%. Our findings suggest that sustainable intelligence requires the freedom to forget as much as the power to think. Date: February 11, (cid:135) Code Models Data Reasoning models have unlocked powerful problemsolving skills by scaling test-time computeusing more thinking tokens to reason before answering. However, this approach faces critical bottleneck: performance does not simply improve with longer thoughts.

Text:"6 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 7 3 1 1 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r a Tessa Han1, Sebastian Bordt2, Hanlin Zhang3, and Sham Kakade3 1 Broad Institute, Schmidt Center 2 University of Tübingen, Tübingen AI Center 3 Harvard University Abstract The prevailing paradigm in large language model (LLM) development is to pretrain base model, then perform further training to improve performance and model behavior. However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base models validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decays mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior. Weight decay is canonical hyperparameter in deep learning whose role has evolved alongside changes in training regimes. In classical multi-epoch training, weight decay was understood primarily as regularizer that improves generalization by shrinking weights and controlling model capacity (Hardt et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2017).

PhyCritic is a multimodal critic model designed for physical AI tasks through a two-stage RLVR pipeline that enhances perception and reasoning capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 With the rapid development of large multimodal models, reliable judge and critic models have become essential for open-ended evaluation and preference alignment, providing pairwise preferences, numerical scores, and explanatory justifications for assessing model-generated responses. However, existing critics are primarily trained in general visual domains such as captioning or image question answering, leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning largely underexplored. We introduce PhyCritic, a multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through a two-stage RLVR pipeline: a physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.

We introduce PhyCritic, a multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through a two-stage RLVR pipeline: a physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks."

FeatureBench evaluates agentic coding performance in comprehensive feature-oriented development through execution-based assessments and automated task derivation from code repositories.  					AI-generated summary 				 Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in the software industry, contributing code as collaborators or even autonomous developers. As their presence grows, it becomes important to assess the current boundaries of their coding abilities. Existing agentic coding benchmarks, however, cover a limited task scope, e.g., bug fixing within a single pull request (PR), and often rely on non-executable evaluations or lack an automated approach for continually updating the evaluation coverage. To address such issues, we propose FeatureBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate agentic coding performance in end-to-end, feature-oriented software development. FeatureBench incorporates an execution-based evaluation protocol and a scalable test-driven method that automatically derives tasks from code repositories with minimal human effort. By tracing from unit tests along a dependency graph, our approach can identify feature-level coding tasks spanning multiple commits and PRs scattered across the development timeline, while ensuring the proper functioning of other features after the separation. Using this framework, we curated 200 challenging evaluation tasks and 3825 executable environments from 24 open-source repositories in the first version of our benchmark. Empirical evaluation reveals that the state-of-the-art agentic model, such as Claude 4.5 Opus, which achieves a 74.4% resolved rate on SWE-bench, succeeds on only 11.0% of tasks, opening new opportunities for advancing agentic coding. Moreover, benefiting from our automated task collection toolkit, FeatureBench can be easily scaled and updated over time to mitigate data leakage. The inherent verifiability of constructed environments also makes our method potentially valuable for agent training.

Ex-Omni is an open-source framework that enhances omni-modal large language models with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation and using speech units as temporal scaffolding.  					AI-generated summary 				 Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify multimodal understanding and generation, yet incorporating speech with 3D facial animation remains largely unexplored despite its importance for natural interaction. A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ex-Omni performs competitively against existing open-source OLLMs while enabling stable aligned speech and facial animation generation.

Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR) enhances LLM reasoning robustness by ensuring reasoning stability and generalizability through transfer rewards that test cross-model guidance capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently strengthened LLM reasoning, but its focus on final answer correctness leaves a critical gap: it does not ensure the robustness of the reasoning process itself. We adopt a simple philosophical view, robust reasoning should remain useful beyond the mind that produced it, and treat reasoning as a form of meaning transfer that must survive truncation, reinterpretation, and continuation. Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps. For example, on MATH500, RLTR achieves a +3.6%p gain in Maj@64 compared to RLVR and matches RLVR's average accuracy with roughly 2.5x fewer training steps, providing both more reliable reasoning and significantly more sample efficient.

Free()LM addresses reasoning model limitations by introducing a self-forgetting mechanism through a Free-Module plug-and-play LoRA adapter, improving performance across scales and long-horizon tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning models enhance problem-solving by scaling test-time compute, yet they face a critical paradox: excessive thinking tokens often degrade performance rather than improve it. We attribute this to a fundamental architectural flaw: standard LLMs operate as "malloc-only" engines, continuously accumulating valid and redundant steps alike without a mechanism to prune obsolete information. To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state.   Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B). It achieves a 3.3% average improvement over top-tier reasoning baselines, even establishing a new SOTA on IMOanswerBench using DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale. Most notably, in long-horizon tasks where the standard Qwen3-235B-A22B model suffers a total collapse (0% accuracy), Free()LM restores performance to 50%. Our findings suggest that sustainable intelligence requires the freedom to forget as much as the power to think.

Pretraining with larger weight decay values improves model plasticity and downstream fine-tuning performance by encouraging linearly separable representations and reducing overfitting.  					AI-generated summary 				 The prevailing paradigm in large language model (LLM) development is to pretrain a base model, then perform further training to improve performance and model behavior. However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior.

Механизм этого явления заключается в том, что большое затухание весов способствует формированию линейно разделимых представлений, регуляризирует матрицы внимания и снижает переобучение.

"Pretraining with larger weight decay values improves model plasticity and downstream fine-tuning performance by encouraging linearly separable representations and reducing overfitting.  					AI-generated summary 				 The prevailing paradigm in large language model (LLM) development is to pretrain a base model, then perform further training to improve performance and model behavior. However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior."
