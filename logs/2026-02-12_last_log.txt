[ 1 1 3 2 0 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) assigns single scalar advantage to all tokens in completion. For structured generations with explicit segments and objectives, this couples unrelated reward signals across segments, leading to objective interference and misattributed credit. We propose Blockwise Advantage Estimation, family of GRPO-compatible methods that assigns each objective its own advantage and applies it only to the tokens in the corresponding text block, reducing reliance on hand-designed scalar rewards and scaling naturally to additional objectives. key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states. Concretely, we introduce an OutcomeConditioned Baseline that approximates intermediate state values using only within-group statistics by stratifying samples according to prefixderived intermediate outcome. On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, our method mitigates reward interference, is competitive with state-ofthe-art reward-designed approach, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling. More broadly, it provides modular recipe for optimizing sequential objectives in structured generations without additional rollouts. 1. Introduction Reinforcement Learning (RL) has gained significant traction as the primary paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to solve complex tasks that are difficult to supervise with static datasets (Ouyang et al., 2022).

February 12, 2026. ifications (DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), GSPO (Zheng et al., 2025), CISPO (MiniMax et al., 2025), ScaleRL (Khatri et al., 2025)) have become particularly popular due to their stability and memory efficiency. By normalizing rewards within sampled group of trajectories rather than relying on separate value network, these methods avoid the need for maintaining critic model, significantly reducing the computational footprint of training inherent to classical PPO. Despite these advantages, standard GRPO typically treats each generated completion as monolithic trajectory: it computes single scalar advantage and applies it uniformly to all tokens. This formulation is often suboptimal for complex tasks involving sequential subgoals, independent rubrics, or multi-step refinements. Given sequence of rewards r1, ..., rn, the standard approach is to construct scalar function = (r1, r2, ..., rn) that maps all rewards into one number and then apply GRPO-like algorithm (Shao et al., 2025; Feng et al., 2025a). This exacerbates credit assignment and requires careful handcrafting of to avoid score degradation described in RLCR (Damani et al., 2025), mode collapse, and reward hacking (Feng et al., 2025a). Many LLM tasks, however, are naturally segmented: each rk can be assigned to non-overlapping text blocks (e.g., solution to problem gets r1, and the following self-reflection block gets r2). Our core insight is that, in this case, optimization does not have to be framed as reward design problem. Instead, we can update each block independently based on signals tied specifically to its local objective rk. Motivated by this observation, we introduce Blockwise Advantage Estimation, family of GRPO-compatible methods that, using only the initial set of rollouts, compute separate proxy-advantages for different text segments and update each segment using only its local objective signal. central technical challenge is baseline estimation for later segments. Consider generation partitioned into segments X1, X2, . . ., where Xi is sampled conditioned on the prefix up to Xi1. To form low-variance advantage for segment Xi, one ideally normalizes the segment-level reward relative to the value of the intermediate state at the end of segment Xi1. naive solution is to perform Monte Carlo rollouts from the intermediate state, similar to VinePPO (KazemneBlockwise Advantage Estimation for Multi-Objective RL with Verifiable Rewards jad et al., 2025) or SPO (Guo et al., 2025), yielding unbiased estimates but incurring prohibitive compute for long-context LLMs and multi-thousand-token generations. We therefore focus on scalable baseline estimators that use only data already produced within the current GRPO group. We study series of progressively more informative estimators and find that an Outcome-Conditioned Baseline performs best in practice. This allows us to approximate the state-value function and reduce variance without additional inference costs. Our contributions are as follows: We introduce Blockwise Advantage Estimation, critic-free, GRPO-compatible framework for multiobjective RL on structured generations that routes objective-specific advantages to the segments of tokens that control them, reducing reliance on hand-tuned scalar reward combinations. We formalize the conditional baseline problem that arises because later segments are sampled conditioned on earlier sampled segments, and show that the Group Mean Baseline proposed in vanilla GRPO (normalizing rewards for all turns by the within-group mean and variance) can be suboptimal for credit assignment in multisegment generations. We then propose computeefficient Outcome-Conditioned Baseline that approximates boundary-state values using only within-group statistics, reducing variance for later segments without Monte-Carlo rollouts or extra inference. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the task of joint reasoning and uncertainty estimation across three models. Our approach performs on par with state-of-the-art (SoTA) reward-designed baseline like RLCR in terms of Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and reasoning accuracy. We demonstrate broader applicability in the additional setting of two-attempt RL for math, and discuss implications for long-horizon agentic tasks where segmentlevel decoupling enables efficient optimization over extremely long contexts. 2.

Blockwise Advantage Estimation addresses reward interference in structured generations by assigning separate advantages to different text blocks, using outcome-conditioned baselines to avoid expensive nested rollouts.  					AI-generated summary 				 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) assigns a single scalar advantage to all tokens in a completion. For structured generations with explicit segments and objectives, this couples unrelated reward signals across segments, leading to objective interference and misattributed credit. We propose Blockwise Advantage Estimation, a family of GRPO-compatible methods that assigns each objective its own advantage and applies it only to the tokens in the corresponding text block, reducing reliance on hand-designed scalar rewards and scaling naturally to additional objectives. A key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states. Concretely, we introduce an Outcome-Conditioned Baseline that approximates intermediate state values using only within-group statistics by stratifying samples according to a prefix-derived intermediate outcome. On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, our method mitigates reward interference, is competitive with a state-of-the-art reward-designed approach, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling. More broadly, it provides a modular recipe for optimizing sequential objectives in structured generations without additional rollouts.

"Blockwise Advantage Estimation addresses reward interference in structured generations by assigning separate advantages to different text blocks, using outcome-conditioned baselines to avoid expensive nested rollouts.  					AI-generated summary 				 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) assigns a single scalar advantage to all tokens in a completion. For structured generations with explicit segments and objectives, this couples unrelated reward signals across segments, leading to objective interference and misattributed credit. We propose Blockwise Advantage Estimation, a family of GRPO-compatible methods that assigns each objective its own advantage and applies it only to the tokens in the corresponding text block, reducing reliance on hand-designed scalar rewards and scaling naturally to additional objectives. A key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states. Concretely, we introduce an Outcome-Conditioned Baseline that approximates intermediate state values using only within-group statistics by stratifying samples according to a prefix-derived intermediate outcome. On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, our method mitigates reward interference, is competitive with a state-of-the-art reward-designed approach, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling. More broadly, it provides a modular recipe for optimizing sequential objectives in structured generations without additional rollouts."
