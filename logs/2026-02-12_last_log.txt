[ 1 8 0 0 1 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aWe present ROCKET, training-free model compression method that achieves state-of-theart performance in comparison with factorization, structured-sparsification and dynamic compression baselines. Operating under global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to target model size. Second, it introduces single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 2050% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90% of the original models performance at 30% compression without any finetuning. Moreover, when applying light finetuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8Bparameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B.

Modern large language models (LLMs) typically scale up to billions of parameters, significantly increasing the computational and memory requirements for both training and inference stages. This substantial resource demand poses critical challenge for their wider practical deployment, especially on edge devices or in latency-sensitive applications. Due to the excessive size of modern LLMs, there has been significant research effort to make such models more efficient and accessible under constrained hardware budgets. Such efforts primarily focus on three key strategies: quantization (Hassibi & Stork, 1992), distillation(Hinton et al., 2015), and weight compression via matrix factorization (Wang et al., 2020). Among these, post-training weight factorization has emerged as particularly promising direction, enabling substantial parameter reduction without the need for costly retraining or fine-tuning. dominant paradigm in this area is low-rank approximation using truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which approximates each weight matrix as the product of two smaller dense matrices. However, this strategy imposes rigid structural constraint forcing all columns of the weight matrix to lie in single shared low-dimensional subspace. This often limits the representational capacity and leads to significant performance degradation under moderate to high compression. This limitation has spurred the development of methods that go beyond single shared subspace representation , adopting instead union-of-subspaces framework akin to dictionary learning. In such models, weight matrix is expressed as combination of subset of basis matrices (Zhussip et al., 2025), or alternatively, its individual columns are represented as sparse linear combinations of atoms from shared dictionary (Shopkhoev et al., 2025). These formulations provide greater flexibility by capturing the heterogeneous local structures present within the weight matrix. Despite their theoretical appeal, practical adoption of these methods faces severe computational challenges: conventional dictionary learning algorithms rely on iterative alternating minimization between sparse coding and dictionary update steps, which is prohibitively expensive for large-scale LLM weight matrices (Aharon et al., 2006). ROCKET: Rapid Optimization via Calibration-guided Knapsack Enhanced Truncation for Efficient Model Compression In this work, we propose ROCKET, fast, training-free compression method that overcomes the representational rigidity of low-rank factorization while avoiding the computational burden of iterative dictionary learning. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, ROCKET compresses weight matrices via single-step structured sparsification of low-rank basis. This yields factorization that inherits the expressive power of union-of-subspaces models yet operates orders of magnitude faster than alternating minimization schemes. Second, rather than applying uniform compression or relying on heuristic layer-wise sensitivity estimates, ROCKET formulates global compression allocation as multi-choice knapsack problem. For each layer, it selects the optimal compression configuration from set of precomputed candidates to minimize total weight reconstruction error under target model size constraint. Together, these components enable ROCKET to produce compact models that achieve substantially higher accuracy compared to existing post-training compression methods. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: (1) We propose ROCKET, an efficient, training-free LLM compression method that factorizes weight matrices into sparse dictionary representation computable in single step, eliminating the need for iterative optimization; (2) We introduce calibration-guided criterion for sparsifying the coefficient matrix, operating effectively in both the original and whitened weight spaces to preserve salient directional information; (3) We formulate layer-wise compression allocation as multi-choice knapsack problem, enabling dynamic, performance-aware distribution of the global compression budget across layers; (4) Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ROCKET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compression methods including structured sparsification, low-rank factorization, and adaptive budget allocation techniques across multiple modalities (text, vision, and audio). 2.

ROCKET is a training-free model compression method that formulates layer-wise compression as a multi-choice knapsack problem and uses sparse matrix factorization for efficient weight sparsification without iterative optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present ROCKET, a training-free model compression method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with factorization, structured-sparsification and dynamic compression baselines. Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\% of the original model's performance at 30\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B. The code for ROCKET is at github.com/mts-ai/ROCKET/tree/main.
