To improve training dynamics when transitioning from causal to bidirectional attention, we propose Gradient-Guided Soft Masking, gradient-based pre-warmup applied before linear scheduler that gradually opens future attention during optimization. Evaluated on 9 industrial user cognition benchmarks covering prediction, preference, and marketing sensitivity tasks, our approach consistently yields more stable training and higher-quality bidirectional representations compared with causal, hybrid, and scheduler-only baselines, while remaining compatible with decoder pretraining.

Text:"6 2 0 2 8 ] . [ 1 9 9 0 8 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r VidVec: Unlocking Video MLLM Embeddings for VideoText Retrieval Issar Tzachor 1 Dvir Samuel 1 Rami Ben-AriRecent studies have adapted generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into embedding extractors for vision tasks, typically through fine-tuning to produce universal representations. However, their performance on video remains inferior to Video Foundation Models (VFMs). In this paper, we focus on leveraging MLLMs for videotext embedding and retrieval. We first conduct systematic layer-wise analysis, showing that intermediate (pre-trained) MLLM layers already encode substantial task-relevant information. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that combining intermediate-layer embeddings with calibrated MLLM head yields strong zero-shot retrieval performance without any training. Building on these findings, we introduce lightweight text-based alignment strategy which maps dense video captions to short summaries and enables task-related videotext embedding learning without visual supervision. Remarkably, without any fine-tuning beyond text, our method outperforms current methods, often by substantial margin, achieving state-of-the-art results across common video retrieval benchmarks. 1. Introduction Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently emerged as dominant paradigm in visionlanguage understanding, demonstrating strong performance across tasks such as captioning (Jia et al., 2024), visual question answering (Awadalla et al., 2023), and even visual mathematical reasoning (Chen et al., 2025). common design represents visual input as sequences of visual tokens that are fed into generative Large Language Model (LLM) which, after joint fine-tuning, enables open-world reasoning and instruction following over multimodal content. Extending this paradigm from images to videos has led to rapid progress in video-based MLLMs (Zhang et al., 2024b; Cheng et al., 1OriginAI, Israel. Correspondence to: Issar Tzachor <iyttor@gmail.com>. Preprint. February 10, 2026. 1 2024; Zhang et al., 2025a; Tang et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025). Compared to images, videos introduce richer content and temporal dynamics, substantially increasing the challenge of representation learning, reasoning, and retrieval. As MLLMs become increasingly widespread, multimodal representation learning has attracted growing research interest. Early vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), ALIGN (Jia et al., 2021), and BLIP (Li et al., 2022) established powerful dual-encoder recipe for text-image representations by aligning image and text embeddings with contrastive learning on large-scale imagetext data. Follow-up studies suggest extensions of these models to video embedding and retrieval (Luo et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2021). Recent large Video Foundation Models (VFMs) have pushed zero-shot and transfer performance by scaling videotext pretraining. InternVideo2 (Wang et al., 2024) has pretrained 100M videotext pairs to reach superior performance, while VideoPrism (Zhao et al., 2024) contrastively trained with 600M pairs. Recent studies suggest that simply scaling videotext pretraining does not uniformly improve performance (Feichtenhofer et al., 2022; Tong et al., 2022; Uselis et al., 2025) motivating alternative approaches that focus on representation quality and task-related alignment, rather than relying solely on ever-larger corpora. Recently, an emerging line of work investigates whether MLLMs can serve as representation learners across visiontext modalities, motivated by the state-of-the-art performance of LLM-based embedding models on MTEB (Muennighoff et al., 2023). E5-V (Jiang et al., 2024) suggested refining MLLMs language component using textual supervision to learn image-text aligned embeddings. Subsequent methods (Jiang et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2025) convert MLLMs into embedding models by incorporating visiontext paired data into contrastive training. To overcome the limited scale of curated embedding datasets, MegaPairs (Zhou et al., 2024) and UniIR (Wei et al., 2024) propose large-scale training datasets. Although recent methods report impressive results on image retrieval (Zhang et al., 2025b; Thirukovalluru et al., 2025; Kong et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025; Gu et al., 2026), video is often treated as an auxiliary modality rather than primary focus, and performance on video retrieval remains VidVec: Unlocking Video MLLM Embeddings for VideoText Retrieval Figure 1. An overview of VidVec. (a) Zero-shot retrieval: extract video and text embeddings from an intermediate MLLM layer for initial ranking. (b) Zero-shot reranking: leverage the calibrated MLLM head for pairwise scoring to rerank top-K candidates. (c) In-context optimization: lightweight model alignment using only 60K text-only pairs for embedding extraction via text-to-text mapping from dense video captions to short summaries, designed to mirror the videotext inference setup. behind that of dedicated Video Foundation Models (VFMs) (Wang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023; Lan et al., 2025b). The few efforts that explicitly target video have yet to achieve strong results on standard videotext retrieval benchmarks. CARE (Xu et al., 2024) emphasizes fine-grained captioning and retrieval but underperforms in conventional retrieval settings, while VLM2Vec-V2 (Meng et al., 2025) incorporates videotext pairs during training yet reports substantially lower performance, even compared to earlier MLLM-based embedders (Kong et al., 2025). Overview of our approach. In this work, we study MLLMs as embedding extractors specifically for videotext retrieval. We show that off-the-shelf MLLMs encode substantial retrieval-relevant information in their hidden representations. systematic layer-wise analysis reveals that selecting appropriate intermediate layers already yield strong zero-shot retrieval performance (Fig. 1a). Further gains are obtained by re-ranking with calibrated MLLM head (Fig. 1b). Finally, we propose an efficient in-context optimization scheme that maps dense video captions to short summaries, enabling task-related embedding learning without visual inputs (Fig. 1c). Using only 60K text-only in-context pairs, we outperform trained MLLM embedders and video foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more videotext data. The key contributions of this work are: 1. We propose methodology to assess and exploit hidden representations o"

Research investigates the impact of different attention masking strategies on user embedding quality in decoder-only language models, proposing a gradient-guided soft masking technique to improve training stability and representation quality for user behavior analysis.  					AI-generated summary 				 Decoder-only large language models are increasingly used as behavioral encoders for user representation learning, yet the impact of attention masking on the quality of user embeddings remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of causal, hybrid, and bidirectional attention masks within a unified contrastive learning framework trained on large-scale real-world Alipay data that integrates long-horizon heterogeneous user behaviors. To improve training dynamics when transitioning from causal to bidirectional attention, we propose Gradient-Guided Soft Masking, a gradient-based pre-warmup applied before a linear scheduler that gradually opens future attention during optimization. Evaluated on 9 industrial user cognition benchmarks covering prediction, preference, and marketing sensitivity tasks, our approach consistently yields more stable training and higher-quality bidirectional representations compared with causal, hybrid, and scheduler-only baselines, while remaining compatible with decoder pretraining. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of masking design and training transition in adapting decoder-only LLMs for effective user representation learning.

Generative multimodal large language models are adapted for video-text embedding and retrieval through intermediate-layer analysis and text-based alignment without visual supervision.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent studies have adapted generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into embedding extractors for vision tasks, typically through fine-tuning to produce universal representations. However, their performance on video remains inferior to Video Foundation Models (VFMs). In this paper, we focus on leveraging MLLMs for video-text embedding and retrieval. We first conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis, showing that intermediate (pre-trained) MLLM layers already encode substantial task-relevant information. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that combining intermediate-layer embeddings with a calibrated MLLM head yields strong zero-shot retrieval performance without any training. Building on these findings, we introduce a lightweight text-based alignment strategy which maps dense video captions to short summaries and enables task-related video-text embedding learning without visual supervision. Remarkably, without any fine-tuning beyond text, our method outperforms current methods, often by a substantial margin, achieving state-of-the-art results across common video retrieval benchmarks.

A Deep Reinforcement Learning framework combining Proximal Policy Optimization and Graph Neural Networks addresses multi-objective scheduling challenges by effectively balancing total weighted tardiness and total setup time.  					AI-generated summary 				 The Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (UPMSP) with release dates, setups, and eligibility constraints presents a significant multi-objective challenge. Traditional methods struggle to balance minimizing Total Weighted Tardiness (TWT) and Total Setup Time (TST). This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The GNN effectively represents the complex state of jobs, machines, and setups, allowing the PPO agent to learn a direct scheduling policy. Guided by a multi-objective reward function, the agent simultaneously minimizes TWT and TST. Experimental results on benchmark instances demonstrate that our PPO-GNN agent significantly outperforms a standard dispatching rule and a metaheuristic, achieving a superior trade-off between both objectives. This provides a robust and scalable solution for complex manufacturing scheduling.
