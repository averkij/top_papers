Text:"6 2 0 2 8 ] . [ 1 0 0 9 7 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Rethinking the Value of Agent-Generated Tests for LLM-Based Software Engineering Agents ZHI CHEN, Singapore Management University, Singapore ZHENSU SUN, Singapore Management University, Singapore YULING SHI, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China CHAO PENG, ByteDance, China XIAODONG GU, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China DAVID LO, Singapore Management University, Singapore LINGXIAO JIANG, Singapore Management University, Singapore Large Language Model (LLM) code agents increasingly resolve repository-level issues by iteratively editing code, invoking tools, and validating candidate patches. In these workflows, agents often write tests on the fly, paradigm adopted by many high-ranking agents on the SWE-bench leaderboard. However, we observe that GPT-5.2, which writes almost no new tests, can even achieve performance comparable to top-ranking agents. This raises the critical question: whether such tests meaningfully improve issue resolution or merely mimic human testing practices while consuming substantial interaction budget. To reveal the impact of agent-written tests, we present an empirical study that analyzes agent trajectories across six state-of-the-art LLMs on SWE-bench Verified. Our results show that while test writing is commonly adopted, but resolved and unresolved tasks within the same model exhibit similar test-writing frequencies Furthermore, these tests typically serve as observational feedback channels, where agents prefer valuerevealing print statements significantly more than formal assertion-based checks. Based on these insights, we perform controlled experiment by revising the prompts of four agents to either increase or reduce test writing. The results suggest that changes in the volume of agent-written tests do not significantly change final outcomes. Taken together, our study reveals that current test-writing practices may provide marginal utility in autonomous software engineering tasks. Additional Key "

Empirical analysis of LLM code agents reveals that test writing provides limited improvement in issue resolution and is often replaced by observation-based debugging methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Model (LLM) code agents increasingly resolve repository-level issues by iteratively editing code, invoking tools, and validating candidate patches. In these workflows, agents often write tests on the fly, a paradigm adopted by many high-ranking agents on the SWE-bench leaderboard. However, we observe that GPT-5.2, which writes almost no new tests, can even achieve performance comparable to top-ranking agents. This raises the critical question: whether such tests meaningfully improve issue resolution or merely mimic human testing practices while consuming a substantial interaction budget.   To reveal the impact of agent-written tests, we present an empirical study that analyzes agent trajectories across six state-of-the-art LLMs on SWE-bench Verified. Our results show that while test writing is commonly adopted, but resolved and unresolved tasks within the same model exhibit similar test-writing frequencies Furthermore, these tests typically serve as observational feedback channels, where agents prefer value-revealing print statements significantly more than formal assertion-based checks. Based on these insights, we perform a controlled experiment by revising the prompts of four agents to either increase or reduce test writing. The results suggest that changes in the volume of agent-written tests do not significantly change final outcomes. Taken together, our study reveals that current test-writing practices may provide marginal utility in autonomous software engineering tasks.

Авторы обнаружили, что написание тестов, хотя и широко распространено среди лучших агентов, не обеспечивает значительного улучшения в разрешении задач и часто заменяется методами отладки на основе наблюдений. Эмпирическое исследование показало, что тесты, создаваемые агентами, служат преимущественно в качестве каналов обратной связи с использованием print-ориентированных выводов вместо формальных проверок. Контролируемые эксперименты подтвердили, что изменение объёма написания тестов не влияет существенно на итоговые результаты решения задач.",

"Empirical analysis of LLM code agents reveals that test writing provides limited improvement in issue resolution and is often replaced by observation-based debugging methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Model (LLM) code agents increasingly resolve repository-level issues by iteratively editing code, invoking tools, and validating candidate patches. In these workflows, agents often write tests on the fly, a paradigm adopted by many high-ranking agents on the SWE-bench leaderboard. However, we observe that GPT-5.2, which writes almost no new tests, can even achieve performance comparable to top-ranking agents. This raises the critical question: whether such tests meaningfully improve issue resolution or merely mimic human testing practices while consuming a substantial interaction budget.   To reveal the impact of agent-written tests, we present an empirical study that analyzes agent trajectories across six state-of-the-art LLMs on SWE-bench Verified. Our results show that while test writing is commonly adopted, but resolved and unresolved tasks within the same model exhibit similar test-writing frequencies Furthermore, these tests typically serve as observational feedback channels, where agents prefer value-revealing print statements significantly more than formal assertion-based checks. Based on these insights, we perform a controlled experiment by revising the prompts of four agents to either increase or reduce test writing. The results suggest that changes in the volume of agent-written tests do not significantly change final outcomes. Taken together, our study reveals that current test-writing practices may provide marginal utility in autonomous software engineering tasks."
