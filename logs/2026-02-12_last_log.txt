Text:"LiveMedBench: Contamination-Free Medical Benchmark for LLMs with Automated Rubric Evaluation Dingjie Song Lehigh University Bethlehem, PA, USA Zhiling Yan Lehigh University Bethlehem, PA, USA Zhe Fang Harvard University Boston, MA, USA 6 2 0 2 0 1 ] A . [ 1 7 6 3 0 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Yisheng Ji Imperial College London London, United Kingdom Xiang Li Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School Boston, MA, USA Quanzheng Li Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School Boston, MA, USA Lichao Sun Lehigh University Bethlehem, PA, USA Abstract The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in highstakes clinical settings demands rigorous and reliable evaluation. However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose MultiAgent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702"

Text:"Latent Thoughts Tuning: Bridging Context and Reasoning with Fused Information in Latent Tokens Weihao Liu 1 Dehai Min 1 Lu ChengWhile explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) equips Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities, it requires models to verbalize every intermediate step in text tokens, constraining the model thoughts to the discrete vocabulary space. Recently, reasoning in continuous latent space has emerged as promising alternative, enabling more robust inference and flexible computation beyond discrete token constraints. However, current latent paradigms often suffer from feature collapse and instability, stemming from distribution mismatches when recurrently using hidden states as the input embeddings, or alignment issues when relying on assistant models. To address this, we propose Latent Thoughts Tuning (LT-Tuning), framework that redefines how latent thoughts are constructed and deployed. Instead of relying solely on raw hidden states, our method introduces ContextPrediction-Fusion mechanism that jointly leveraging contextual hidden states and predictive semantic guidance from the vocabulary embedding space. Combined with progressive three-stage curriculum learning pipeline, LT-Tuning also enables dynamically switching between latent and explicit thinking modes. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing latent reasoning baselines, effectively mitigating feature collapse and achieving robust reasoning accuracy. 2 6 2 0 2 0 1 ] . [ 1 9 2 2 0 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r 1. Introduction The capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning has largely depended on generating explicit text steps, known as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 1Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. Correspondence to: Weihao Liu <wliu681@uic.edu>, Lu Cheng <lucheng@uic.edu>. Preprint. February 12, 2026. 2Repository URL. 1 Figure 1. Comparison of reasoning paradigms. Explicit CoT verbalizes all steps as text tokens. Coconut uses fixed number of latent tokens from hidden states. Soft-Thinking constructs latent tokens via probability-weighted interpolation with entropy-based stopping. Assistant-based methods rely on external models. Our LT-Tuning dynamically interleaves text and latent tokens through confidence-driven insertion and Context-Prediction Fusion. (Wei et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023). Although effective, this approach requires the model to perform reasoning in discrete token sequence, which means the model can not think twice before acting, or they demand extra cost on extremely long text output (Jaech et al., 2024; Yeo et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025; Seed et al., 2025) and self-reflection (Renze & Guven, 2024; Kang et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025). Motivated by these limitations, recent work has explored reasoning in continuous latent spaces as an alternative (Zhu et al., 2025a; Chen et al., 2025). By allowing models to reason directly in high-dimensional hidden states rather than explicit tokens (Hao et al., 2024; Shen et al., 2025; Wei Latent Thoughts Tuning: Bridging Context and Reasoning with Fused Information in Latent Tokens et al., 2025), this line of research aims to decouple internal reasoning from explicit text generation. While promising, latent-space reasoning methods face two fundamental challenges: Constructing well-aligned latent representations. Latent tokens must be semantically expressive while remaining compatible with the models internal embedding space. Methods relying on external assistant models (Xu et al., 2025; He et al., 2025) struggle with representational misalignment, whereas purely intrinsic approaches (Chen et al., 2025) risk distribution mismatch between input embeddings and output hidden statesparticularly in models with untied input and output embeddingswhich can lead to instability or feature collapse. Adapting reasoning cost dynamically. Most existing methods employ static reasoning schedules, ignoring the fact that step difficulty varies. This fixed allocation is often inefficient, as it wastes computation on trivial steps while failing to provide sufficient depth for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Latent Thoughts Tuning (LT-Tuning), framework that enables LLMs to perform robust latent reasoning without external assistants. An illustration of the difference between our method and mainstream methods in latent reasoning is visualized in Figure 1. Our core innovation is Context-Prediction Fusion mechanism that constructs latent tokens by combining two complementary sources: the contextual history encoded in hidden states, and the predictive semantic guidance from probability-weighted vocabulary embeddings. This fusion bridges the gap between the models output space and input embedding manifold, mitigating feature collapse in larger models. Additionally, we introduce confidence-driven strategy that allows the model to dynamically determine when to engage latent reasoning, avoiding the inefficiency of static allocation. The entire framework is trained through three-stage curriculum learning that progressively transitions from purely explicit CoT to reasoning with latent thoughts. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows. (1) unified latent reasoning method. We introduce LTTuning, latent-space reasoning framework that enables adaptive and stable continuous reasoning without architectural modifications. The method integrates (i) confidencedriven dynamic decision on explicit CoT or latent reasoning, (ii) contextprediction fusion to construct well-aligned latent tokens by combining contextual hidden states with predictive semantic guidance, and (iii) progressive curriculum learning strategy that stabilizes latent-space optimization and mitigates feature collapse. 2 (2) Comprehensive empirical evaluation and scaling analysis. We conduct extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks across model scales from 1B to 8B parameters. Results show that LT-Tuning consistently outperforms existing latent reasoning baselines at all scales, achieving up to 4.3% average improvement over the strongest prior method. Notably, while prior approaches such as Coconut (Hao et al., 2024) degrade severely on larger models due to feature collapse, LT-Tuning exhibits robust and healthy scaling behavior across benchmarks. 2.

LiveMedBench addresses limitations in medical LLM evaluation by providing a continuously updated, contamination-free benchmark with rubric-based evaluation that better aligns with expert clinical reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical settings demands rigorous and reliable evaluation. However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Extensive evaluation of 38 LLMs reveals that even the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, and 84% of models exhibit performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, confirming pervasive data contamination risks. Error analysis further identifies contextual application-not factual knowledge-as the dominant bottleneck, with 35-48% of failures stemming from the inability to tailor medical knowledge to patient-specific constraints.

Latent Thoughts Tuning introduces a novel framework for reasoning in continuous latent space by combining contextual hidden states with predictive semantic guidance, enabling robust inference through a progressive curriculum learning approach.  					AI-generated summary 				 While explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) equips Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities, it requires models to verbalize every intermediate step in text tokens, constraining the model thoughts to the discrete vocabulary space. Recently, reasoning in continuous latent space has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling more robust inference and flexible computation beyond discrete token constraints. However, current latent paradigms often suffer from feature collapse and instability, stemming from distribution mismatches when recurrently using hidden states as the input embeddings, or alignment issues when relying on assistant models. To address this, we propose Latent Thoughts Tuning (LT-Tuning), a framework that redefines how latent thoughts are constructed and deployed. Instead of relying solely on raw hidden states, our method introduces a Context-Prediction-Fusion mechanism that jointly leveraging contextual hidden states and predictive semantic guidance from the vocabulary embedding space. Combined with a progressive three-stage curriculum learning pipeline, LT-Tuning also enables dynamically switching between latent and explicit thinking modes. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing latent reasoning baselines, effectively mitigating feature collapse and achieving robust reasoning accuracy.

"Latent Thoughts Tuning introduces a novel framework for reasoning in continuous latent space by combining contextual hidden states with predictive semantic guidance, enabling robust inference through a progressive curriculum learning approach.  					AI-generated summary 				 While explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) equips Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities, it requires models to verbalize every intermediate step in text tokens, constraining the model thoughts to the discrete vocabulary space. Recently, reasoning in continuous latent space has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling more robust inference and flexible computation beyond discrete token constraints. However, current latent paradigms often suffer from feature collapse and instability, stemming from distribution mismatches when recurrently using hidden states as the input embeddings, or alignment issues when relying on assistant models. To address this, we propose Latent Thoughts Tuning (LT-Tuning), a framework that redefines how latent thoughts are constructed and deployed. Instead of relying solely on raw hidden states, our method introduces a Context-Prediction-Fusion mechanism that jointly leveraging contextual hidden states and predictive semantic guidance from the vocabulary embedding space. Combined with a progressive three-stage curriculum learning pipeline, LT-Tuning also enables dynamically switching between latent and explicit thinking modes. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing latent reasoning baselines, effectively mitigating feature collapse and achieving robust reasoning accuracy."
