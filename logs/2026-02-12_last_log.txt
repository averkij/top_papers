Text:"Data Repetition Beats Data Scaling in Long-CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning Dawid J. Kopiczko 1 Sagar Vaze 2 Tijmen Blankevoort 3 Yuki M. Asano 1 6 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 9 4 1 1 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aSupervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data is an essential post-training step for reasoning language models. Standard machine learning intuition suggests that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Counterintuitively, we show that SFT benefits from repetition: under fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets. On AIME24/25 and GPQA benchmarks, Olmo37B trained for 128 epochs on 400 samples outperforms the equivalent 1 epoch on 51200 samples by 1226 percentage points, with no additional catastrophic forgetting. We find that training token accuracy reliably signals when repetition has saturated; improvements from additional epochs plateau at full memorization, pattern consistent across all settings. These findings provide practical approach for reasoning SFT, where scaling epochs with token accuracy as stopping criterion can replace expensive undirected data scaling. We pose the repetition advantage, where full memorization coincides with improved generalization, as new open problem for the community in understanding the training dynamics of large language models. Code is available at: https://github.com/ dkopi/data-repetition. 1. Introduction Modern language model training proceeds through distinct stages: pretraining on internet-scale data to acquire world knowledge, mid-training on curated corpora to extend capabilities, and post-training to shape model behavior (Guo et al., 2025; Team OLMo, 2025; Yang et al., 2025). For reasoning-focused models, post-training typically begins with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long Chain-ofThought (CoT) demonstrations, often distilled from 1University of Technology Nuremberg 2Mistral AI 3NVIDIA. Correspondence to: <dj.kopiczko@gmail.com>. Preprint. February 12, 2026. 1 Figure 1. Illustration of our approach to supervised fine-tuning in modern LLM training pipeline. Instead of maximizing dataset size and training for few epochs, we train for many epochs on small random subset of SFT data, substantially reducing compute while improving downstream reasoning performance. more capable models, where reasoning traces can span thousands of tokens before reaching final answer. This SFT step, analogous to behavioral cloning in reinforcement learning (Osa et al., 2018), primes the model for subsequent stages such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022) or reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (Guo et al., 2025; Shao et al., 2024). Unlike pretraining data, which can be scraped at scale from the web, high-quality long-CoT demonstrations require either expensive human annotation or careful distillation from larger models, including generation, filtering, and validation of long reasoning traces. As result, the question of how to best utilize limited SFT data is practically important. The common assumption in machine learning would suggest that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Under i.i.d. sampling, each new example provides independent information about the data distribution, and generalization bounds in statistical learning theory typically improve with dataset size. This principle manifests practically throughout the field data augmentation techniques are widely used to artificially expand effective dataset size when real data is limited (Hernandez-Garcıa & Konig, 2018; Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019), and the success of large language models has been attributed in significant part to training on ever-larger unique corpora. Following this logic, modern post-training pipelines employ millions of SFT samples (Team OLMo, 2025). In this paper, we show that this might not only be suboptimal, but that, actually, reverse pattern can be observed for the SFT stage for pretrained LLM, see Figure 1. Under Data Repetition Beats Data Scaling in Long-CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning Figure 2. Scaling epochs versus scaling data for Olmo3-7B trained on long-CoT SFT data, averaged across AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA benchmarks. Each diagonal represents fixed update budget, where epochs samples is constant. Within any diagonal, moving toward fewer samples and more epochs consistently improves accuracy and pass@n, with gains diminishing around 3264 epochs. Termination rate correlates strongly with accuracy and may be primary driver of performance gains, as models that fail to terminate cannot produce final answer. fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms training on larger datasets. The gains are not marginal. The performance and termination rates, i.e., the models ability to successfully conclude reasoning with final answer, both scale with epoch count and saturate together, suggesting that sufficient repetition of the same data is required for models to fully internalize the demonstrated reasoning structure. We find that this convergence is tightly linked to training set memorization. Performance improvements plateau once models achieve near-perfect next-token prediction accuracy on the training data, even as validation loss continues to rise. This relationship holds across all models we test, all benchmarks, and different training datasets, making train token accuracy practical stopping criterion for scaling epochs. Despite this apparent overfitting, we observe no additional catastrophic forgetting compared to single-epoch training on large datasets. Our main contributions are: Phenomenon. We demonstrate that under fixed update budget, scaling epochs on smaller datasets substantially outperforms scaling unique samples. Dynamics. We identify training token accuracy as reliable stopping criterion for epoch scaling, with performance gains plateauing once models reach full memorization, and we show that multi-epoch training on small datasets causes no additional catastrophic forgetting compared to large datasets. as teacher model size in distillation and the correctness of data samples, affect the repetition advantage. While we provide practical heuristic for exploiting the repetition advantage, we pose explaining this phenomenon in long-CoT SFT as novel, open problem for the community. 2.

However, before training, data must be preprocessed to address missing values, inconsistent formats, and heterogeneous feature scales. This preprocessing stage is critical In practical FL systems, privacy for model performance but is largely overlooked in FL research. constraints prohibit centralizing raw data, while communication efficiency introduces further challenges for distributed preprocessing. We introduce FedPS, unified framework for federated data preprocessing based on aggregated statistics. FedPS leverages data-sketching techniques to efficiently summarize local datasets while preserving essential statistical information. Building on these summaries, we design federated algorithms for feature scaling, encoding, discretization, and missing-value imputation, and extend preprocessing-related models such as k-Means, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Bayesian Linear Regression to both horizontal and vertical FL settings. FedPS provides flexible, communication-efficient, and consistent preprocessing pipelines for practical FL deployments. Data preprocessing (Garcıa et al., 2016) is vital stage of the machine learning pipeline, transforming raw inputs into clean, structured, and analyzable forms. In tabular data, common preprocessing tasks include handling missing values, normalizing feature scales, and encoding categorical variables. Effective preprocessing improves model accuracy, accelerates convergence, and enhances interpretability. Yet despite its importance to model performance, preprocessing remains largely neglected in federated learning (Kairouz et al., 2021), where multiple entities colla"

Training reasoning language models with repeated examples on smaller datasets yields better performance than single-pass training on larger datasets, with token accuracy serving as a reliable indicator for optimal training duration.  					AI-generated summary 				 Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data is an essential post-training step for reasoning language models. Standard machine learning intuition suggests that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Counterintuitively, we show that SFT benefits from repetition: under a fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets. On AIME'24/25 and GPQA benchmarks, Olmo3-7B trained for 128 epochs on 400 samples outperforms the equivalent 1 epoch on 51200 samples by 12-26 percentage points, with no additional catastrophic forgetting. We find that training token accuracy reliably signals when repetition has saturated; improvements from additional epochs plateau at full memorization, a pattern consistent across all settings. These findings provide a practical approach for reasoning SFT, where scaling epochs with token accuracy as a stopping criterion can replace expensive undirected data scaling. We pose the repetition advantage, where full memorization coincides with improved generalization, as a new open problem for the community in understanding the training dynamics of large language models.

"Training reasoning language models with repeated examples on smaller datasets yields better performance than single-pass training on larger datasets, with token accuracy serving as a reliable indicator for optimal training duration.  					AI-generated summary 				 Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data is an essential post-training step for reasoning language models. Standard machine learning intuition suggests that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Counterintuitively, we show that SFT benefits from repetition: under a fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets.

We find that training token accuracy reliably signals when repetition has saturated; improvements from additional epochs plateau at full memorization, a pattern consistent across all settings. These findings provide a practical approach for reasoning SFT, where scaling epochs with token accuracy as a stopping criterion can replace expensive undirected data scaling. We pose the repetition advantage, where full memorization coincides with improved generalization, as a new open problem for the community in understanding the training dynamics of large language models."

FedPS is a federated data preprocessing framework that uses aggregated statistics and data-sketching techniques to enable efficient and privacy-preserving data preparation for collaborative machine learning across distributed datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data. However, before training, data must be preprocessed to address missing values, inconsistent formats, and heterogeneous feature scales. This preprocessing stage is critical for model performance but is largely overlooked in FL research. In practical FL systems, privacy constraints prohibit centralizing raw data, while communication efficiency introduces further challenges for distributed preprocessing. We introduce FedPS, a unified framework for federated data preprocessing based on aggregated statistics. FedPS leverages data-sketching techniques to efficiently summarize local datasets while preserving essential statistical information. Building on these summaries, we design federated algorithms for feature scaling, encoding, discretization, and missing-value imputation, and extend preprocessing-related models such as k-Means, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Bayesian Linear Regression to both horizontal and vertical FL settings. FedPS provides flexible, communication-efficient, and consistent preprocessing pipelines for practical FL deployments.
