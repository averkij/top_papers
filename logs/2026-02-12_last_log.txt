Text:"6 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 2 4 1 5 9 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r EcoGym: Evaluating LLMs for Long-Horizon Plan-and-Execute in Interactive EconomiesLong-horizon planning is widely recognized as core capability of autonomous LLM-based agents; however, current evaluation frameworks suffer from being largely episodic, domain-specific, or insufficiently grounded in persistent economic dynamics. We introduce EcoGym, generalizable benchmark for continuous plan-and-execute decision making in interactive economies. EcoGym comprises three diverse environments: Vending, Freelance, and Operation, implemented in unified decision-making process with standardized interfaces, and budgeted actions over an effectively unbounded horizon (1000+ steps if 365 day-loops for evaluation). The evaluation of EcoGym is based on business-relevant outcomes (e.g., net worth, income, and DAU), targeting long-term strategic coherence and robustness under partial observability and stochasticity. Experiments across eleven leading LLMs expose systematic tension: no single model dominates across all three scenarios. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient actions executions. EcoGym is released as an open, extensible testbed for transparent long-horizon agent evaluation and for studying controllabilityutility trade-offs in realistic economic settings. Date: February 12, 2026 Correspondence: He Zhu at zhuhe@oppo.com, Wangchunshu Zhou at zhouwangchunshu@oppo.com Code: https://github.com/OPPO-PersonalAI/EcoGymLong-horizon planning has been recognized as central agentic capability since the emergence of large language model (LLM)-based agents [22, 39], motivating both agent scaffolds [17, 35, 42] and foundation models [13, 31] to prioritize long-term navigation and decision-making. This emphasis is likewise reflected in contemporary benchmarks and evaluation protocols, which across broad range of domains, ranging from deep research [4, 36] and embodied intelligence [30, 33] to autonomous driving [5, 15] and strategic games [23], explicitly or implicitly assess an agents capacity for sustained, long-range planning. Despite the diversity of planning evaluation methodologies, recent research has increasingly situated agents within complex, real-world commercial environments and assessed planning competence using tangible, economic returns [6, 27]. This shift is driven by two complementary concerns: (1) the gap between performance in controlled, virtual benchmarks and robustness under continuous, high-stakes practical deployment, where agents often exhibit fragility despite strong benchmark results; and (2) the greater value of evaluations grounded in economic impact rather than simple rewards. Representative efforts include OpenAIs GDP Eval [27], Scale AIs Remote Labor Index [24], and the 32-hour expert-level tasks introduced in RE-Bench [37], which collectively aim to quantify the macroeconomic potential of such agents. 1 Figure 1 Long-horizon performances across three environments in EcoGym. The plots illustrate the daily progression of key metrics: Net Worth in Vending (left), Income in Freelance (middle), and DAU in Operation (right). Note: Truncated lines represent agents that failed to survive the full simulation horizon due to triggering failure conditions. Only top-performance models are kept for clarity; full experimental results are available in Table 2. Notwithstanding recent efforts to benchmark long-horizon planning in commercial settings, ranging from macroeconomic evaluations such as GDPval [27] to microeconomic and gamified environments including Vending Bench v1&v2 [2, 3] and HeroBench [1], which introduce competitive pricing or RPG-style resource management, existing testbeds remain limited. They are largely confined to narrow settings such as vending or stylized game scenarios, and therefore fail to reflect the heterogeneous, interdependent business processes characteristic of open-ended economic activity. Moreover, these environments often rely on closed, cumbersome evaluation pipelines (e.g., Vending Bench adheres to strictly proprietary assessment protocol), underscoring the need for transparent, community-driven benchmark framework. To address this, we present EcoGym, an interactive environment designed to evaluate LLMs on long-horizon plan-and-execute tasks within interactive economies. Building upon the foundational methodology of Vending Bench, EcoGym expends the specific vending scenario into three widely-existed economic settings with unified interface: Vending, Freelance, and Operation. It is designed with theoretically infinite horizon (1000+ steps if 365 day-loops for evaluation), latent economic mechanics, simulating business-never-sleeps ecosystem where agents must manage resources sustainably and discover hidden mechanics proactively rather than maximizing short-term rewards. Our empirical evaluation on EcoGym reveals significant performance gap in current LLMs: no single model consistently achieves superior performance across all scenarios, highlighting the inherent difficulty of long-horizon economic decision-making. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient actions executions. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive suite of 8 diagnostic experiments or case studies, encompassing factors such as context window length, agent behavior patterns, additional memory modules, and human baselines. These analyses provide holistic perspective on the limitations and potential of current models in complex interactive economies. Our contributions are as follows: Infinite-Horizon Planning Evaluation. We introduce an open, generalizable framework, EcoGym, for assessing LLM agents under continuous, non-episodic interaction, where compact action space is coupled with an unbounded temporal horizon. This design isolates long-term strategic coherence, stability, and cumulative optimization as first-class evaluation targets, rather than short-horizon task completion. Utility-Guided Economic Assessment. We select three widely-existed economic environments as testbed: Vending, Freelance and Operation, and establish an outcome-oriented evaluation paradigm grounded in economic returns, moving to measure agent behavior by its tangible impact in market settings. Multi-Dimensional Empirical Analysis. We conduct rigorous evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, uncovering critical performance gap where n"

[ 1 8 4 7 0 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract Knowledge Graphs (KGs) store structured factual knowledge by linking entities through relationships, crucial for many applications. These applications depend on the KGs factual accuracy, so verifying facts is essential, yet challenging. Expert manual verification is ideal but impractical on large scale. Automated methods show promise but are not ready for real-world KGs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential with their semantic understanding and knowledge access, yet their suitability and effectiveness for KG fact validation remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce FactCheck, benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs for KG fact validation across three key dimensions: (1) LLMs internal knowledge; (2) external evidence via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); and (3) aggregated knowledge employing multi-model consensus strategy. We evaluated open-source and commercial LLMs on three diverse real-world KGs. FactCheck also includes RAG dataset with 2+ million documents tailored for KG fact validation. The experimental analyses demonstrate that while LLMs yield promising results, they are still not sufficiently stable and reliable to be used in real-world KG validation scenarios. Integrating external evidence through RAG methods yields fluctuating performance, providing inconsistent improvements over more streamlined approaches at higher computational costs. Similarly, strategies based on multi-model consensus do not consistently outperform individual models, underscoring the lack of one-fits-all solution. These findings further emphasize the need for benchmark like FactCheck to systematically evaluate and drive progr"

Keywords safety classification, content moderation, Polish NLP, LLM safety, guardrails, multi-label classification 2026/02/12; 01:58 str. 1/ 1. Introduction The rapid advancement of Large Language Models has revolutionized natural language processing capabilities, enabling sophisticated conversational AI systems across numerous domains [8]. However, this progress brings significant challenges in ensuring safe and responsible deployment, particularly in multilingual contexts where safety resources remain scarce [4]. For Polish language applications, the landscape of LLM safety tools has been particularly limited. Existing solutions either rely on English-centric models adapted to Polish with varying degrees of success, or employ large multilingual models that may be impractical for resource-constrained deployments. The need for dedicated Polish safety classifiers is further motivated by cultural and linguistic nuances that affect what constitutes harmful content and how it should be moderated. We introduce Bielik Guard (codenamed Sójka, meaning jay in Polish vigilant bird symbolizing protection), family of efficient safety classifiers specifically designed for Polish language content. Our contributions include: Two compact model variants (0.1B based on MMLW-RoBERTa and 0.5B based on PKOBP/polish-roberta-8k) optimized for deployment efficiency while maintaining high accuracy community-driven annotation methodology based on bounded rationality principles [15], yielding 6,885 annotated Polish texts with over 60,000 individual ratings five-category safety taxonomy tailored to Polish language applications: Hate/Aggression, Vulgarities, Sexual Content, Crime, and Self-Harm Comprehensive evaluation demonstrating superior precision and lower false positive rates compared to larger multilingual alternatives response-oriented approach that provides appropriate support resources rather than simple blocking, especially for self-harm content The models are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/speakleash and have been deployed in production at https://guard.bielik.ai/, where ongoing community feedback continues to improve the system. 2. Related Work 2.1. LLM-based Safety Classifiers The development of safety guardrails for LLMs has become critical research area, with comprehensive surveys covering the current state of the art [3, 1, 19]. Llama Guard [4] pioneered the approach of using instruction-tuned language models for input-output safety classification, introducing taxonomy-based framework that allows adaptation to different use cases. The subsequent Llama Guard 3 [8] extended this work with an 8B parameter model supporting multilingual classification across 2026/02/12; 01:58 str. 2/19 14 MLCommons hazard categories, achieving F1 scores of 0.939 on English response classification. Similarly, Qwen3Guard [20] introduced three-tiered severity classification (safe, controversial, unsafe) with support for 119 languages, offering models ranging from 0.6B to 8B parameters. ShieldGemma [17], based on the Gemma model family, provides content moderation capabilities with models of various sizes designed for different deployment scenarios. Granite Guardian [13] extends beyond traditional harmfulcontent detection by unifying prompt and response risk detection with coverage of social bias, profanity, violence, sexual content, unethical behavior, jailbreaking, and RAG-specific hallucination risks (context relevance, groundedness, answer relevance). The 2B and 8B variants, trained on combination of human-annotated and synthetic data, achieve AUC scores of 0.871 and 0.854 on harmful-content and RAG groundedness benchmarks respectively. These generative models frame safety as an instruction-following task, enabling flexible deployment scenarios. 2.2. Polish Language Models and Safety The development of Polish language models has accelerated in recent years. The Bielik family of models [12, 11, 10, 9] and the PLLuM family [5] represent significant milestones in Polish LLM development, demonstrating the growing maturity of Polish NLP infrastructure. These foundational models highlight the importance of dedicated Polish language resources and the need for corresponding safety mechanisms. For Polish-specific safety classification, HerBERT-PL-Guard [6] represents significant contribution, fine-tuning the HerBERT model on manually annotated data and Polish translations of PolyGuard and WildGuard datasets. The model supports classification into 15 categories based on the Llama Guard taxonomy, including both safe and 14 unsafe categories. However, existing Polish solutions face limitations: HerBERT-PL-Guard, while comprehensive in its taxonomy, relies on translated data which may not capture authentic Polish linguistic patterns. Multilingual models like Llama Guard 3, despite their broad language coverage, exhibit higher false positive rates and lower precision on Polish content, as our evaluation demonstrates. 2.3.

EcoGym presents a generalizable benchmark for evaluating long-horizon planning capabilities of LLM-based agents in interactive economic environments with persistent dynamics and multi-scenario evaluation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-horizon planning is widely recognized as a core capability of autonomous LLM-based agents; however, current evaluation frameworks suffer from being largely episodic, domain-specific, or insufficiently grounded in persistent economic dynamics. We introduce EcoGym, a generalizable benchmark for continuous plan-and-execute decision making in interactive economies. EcoGym comprises three diverse environments: Vending, Freelance, and Operation, implemented in a unified decision-making process with standardized interfaces, and budgeted actions over an effectively unbounded horizon (1000+ steps if 365 day-loops for evaluation). The evaluation of EcoGym is based on business-relevant outcomes (e.g., net worth, income, and DAU), targeting long-term strategic coherence and robustness under partial observability and stochasticity. Experiments across eleven leading LLMs expose a systematic tension: no single model dominates across all three scenarios. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient actions executions. EcoGym is released as an open, extensible testbed for transparent long-horizon agent evaluation and for studying controllability-utility trade-offs in realistic economic settings.

Large language models show promise but lack stability and reliability for knowledge graph fact validation, with retrieval-augmented generation and multi-model consensus approaches yielding inconsistent improvements.  					AI-generated summary 				 Knowledge Graphs (KGs) store structured factual knowledge by linking entities through relationships, crucial for many applications. These applications depend on the KG's factual accuracy, so verifying facts is essential, yet challenging. Expert manual verification is ideal but impractical on a large scale. Automated methods show promise but are not ready for real-world KGs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential with their semantic understanding and knowledge access, yet their suitability and effectiveness for KG fact validation remain largely unexplored.   In this paper, we introduce FactCheck, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs for KG fact validation across three key dimensions: (1) LLMs internal knowledge; (2) external evidence via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); and (3) aggregated knowledge employing a multi-model consensus strategy. We evaluated open-source and commercial LLMs on three diverse real-world KGs. FactCheck also includes a RAG dataset with 2+ million documents tailored for KG fact validation. Additionally, we offer an interactive exploration platform for analyzing verification decisions.   The experimental analyses demonstrate that while LLMs yield promising results, they are still not sufficiently stable and reliable to be used in real-world KG validation scenarios. Integrating external evidence through RAG methods yields fluctuating performance, providing inconsistent improvements over more streamlined approaches -- at higher computational costs. Similarly, strategies based on multi-model consensus do not consistently outperform individual models, underscoring the lack of a one-fits-all solution. These findings further emphasize the need for a benchmark like FactCheck to systematically evaluate and drive progress on this difficult yet crucial task.

Bielik Guard is a compact Polish language safety classifier family with two variants that effectively categorize content across five safety domains while maintaining high efficiency and accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed in Polish language applications, the need for efficient and accurate content safety classifiers has become paramount. We present Bielik Guard, a family of compact Polish language safety classifiers comprising two model variants: a 0.1B parameter model based on MMLW-RoBERTa-base and a 0.5B parameter model based on PKOBP/polish-roberta-8k. Fine-tuned on a community-annotated dataset of 6,885 Polish texts, these models classify content across five safety categories: Hate/Aggression, Vulgarities, Sexual Content, Crime, and Self-Harm. Our evaluation demonstrates that both models achieve strong performance on multiple benchmarks. The 0.5B variant offers the best overall discrimination capability with F1 scores of 0.791 (micro) and 0.785 (macro) on the test set, while the 0.1B variant demonstrates exceptional efficiency. Notably, Bielik Guard 0.1B v1.1 achieves superior precision (77.65%) and very low false positive rate (0.63%) on real user prompts, outperforming HerBERT-PL-Guard (31.55% precision, 4.70% FPR) despite identical model size. The models are publicly available and designed to provide appropriate responses rather than simple content blocking, particularly for sensitive categories like self-harm.

"Bielik Guard is a compact Polish language safety classifier family with two variants that effectively categorize content across five safety domains while maintaining high efficiency and accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed in Polish language applications, the need for efficient and accurate content safety classifiers has become paramount. We present Bielik Guard, a family of compact Polish language safety classifiers comprising two model variants: a 0.1B parameter model based on MMLW-RoBERTa-base and a 0.5B parameter model based on PKOBP/polish-roberta-8k. Fine-tuned on a community-annotated dataset of 6,885 Polish texts, these models classify content across five safety categories: Hate/Aggression, Vulgarities, Sexual Content, Crime, and Self-Harm. Our evaluation demonstrates that both models achieve strong performance on multiple benchmarks. The 0.5B variant offers the best overall discrimination capability with F1 scores of 0.791 (micro) and 0.785 (macro) on the test set, while the 0.1B variant demonstrates exceptional efficiency. Notably, Bielik Guard 0.1B v1.1 achieves superior precision (77.65%) and very low false positive rate (0.63%) on real user prompts, outperforming HerBERT-PL-Guard (31.55% precision, 4.70% FPR) despite identical model size. The models are publicly available and designed to provide appropriate responses rather than simple content blocking, particularly for sensitive categories like self-harm."
