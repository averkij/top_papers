IMPACT STATEMENT Machine unlearning has traditionally been studied as distinct research area, separate from the well-established field of incremental learning. While incremental learning has been extensively investigated for decades, machine unlearning has only recently gained attention due to growing concerns about data privacy and regulatory requirements. This paper makes significant conceptual leap by establishing, for the first time, theoretical connection between these two fields. Our work bridges this critical gap, enabling the transfer of robust methodologies and algorithmic insights from incremental learning to J.

Corresponding author: Defu Lian. the design of efficient machine unlearning solutions.Beyond theoretical contributions, we present the Influence Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm, which empirically validates the feasibility. By leveraging principles from incremental learning, IAU achieves superior performance compared to existing unlearning methods, offering scalable and practical solution for privacy-aware machine learning systems. This advancement not only enriches the understanding of both fields but also opens new avenues for developing high-performance unlearning algorithms grounded in well-studied incremental learning techniques. Our work thus represents substantial step forward in the intersection of machine unlearning, data privacy, and algorithmic innovation. II. INTRODUCTION our daily lives, people generate vast amounts of data through social media updates, banking transactions, and cloud-synced location data. Organizations exploit user data to train personalized machine learning (ML) models. Machine unlearning [1], an important field of ML research, has received increasing attention. It aims to erase sample-specific information from models efficiently. On the one hand, growing privacy concerns drive users to selectively delete sensitive information, aligning with privacy regulations such as the European Unions GDPR [2], which grants individuals the right to be forgotten, i.e., the right of an individuals data to be deleted from database (and derived products) and requires companies to delete personal data upon request. On the other hand, efficient machine unlearning is crucial in various scenarios, including removing contaminated data points due to data poisoning attacks [3], [4], eliminating outdated information [5], and handling misleading or ambiguous data [6]. These diverse needs underscore the importance of developing algorithms that enable models to quickly forget specific training points without significant utility loss. An intuitive approach to implementing unlearning is to retrain the model from scratch based on the remaining data upon receiving forgetting request. Although this can provide precise removal guarantees and maintain model utility, it is time-consuming and computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets and frequent forgetting requests. Therefore, it is crucial to design an efficient unlearning mechanism that balances the trade-offs among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency, and comparable model utility. Current unlearning approaches can be broadly categorized into two main classes: (1) Exact unlearning [7], which typically involves partitioning the training dataset into distinct 2 shards, with each shard used to train an isolated sub-model. During inference, the results from all sub-models are aggregated to produce the final output. When forgetting request arrives, only the shard containing the data points to be forgotten is retrained, while other sub-models remain unchanged [1], [7] [9]. This approach ensures precise removal of the targeted data but disrupts the inherent relationships between data points, leading to significant performance degradation. Additionally, retraining the affected sub-model, even for single shard, remains computationally expensive and time-consuming process. (2) Approximate unlear"

The paper introduces the Influence Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm, which leverages incremental learning principles to efficiently address the computational challenges of influence-based unlearning in machine learning models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However, this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency, and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lolo1222/IAU.
