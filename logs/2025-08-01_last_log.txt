This paper provides preliminary answer to this challenge by demonstrating that RLfinetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can achieve zeroshot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore RLs potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction capabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL representation, we analyze and establish crossview goal specification as unified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome the significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task synthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale multi-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework to support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction success rates by 4 and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our findings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated environments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for significantly advancing visuomotor agents spatial reasoning.

AgroBench evaluates vision-language models across agricultural tasks, revealing areas for improvement in fine-grained identification, particularly weed identification, with expert-annotated categories.  					AI-generated summary 				 Precise automated understanding of agricultural tasks such as disease identification is essential for sustainable crop production. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to further expand the range of agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy, text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks. Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random. With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the types of errors made by VLMs and suggest potential pathways for future VLM development. Our dataset and code are available at https://dahlian00.github.io/AgroBenchPage/ .

"AgroBench evaluates vision-language models across agricultural tasks, revealing areas for improvement in fine-grained identification, particularly weed identification, with expert-annotated categories.  					AI-generated summary 				 Precise automated understanding of agricultural tasks such as disease identification is essential for sustainable crop production. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to further expand the range of agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy, text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks. Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random. With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the types of errors made by VLMs and suggest potential pathways for future VLM development. Our dataset and code are available at https://dahlian00.github.io/AgroBenchPage/ ."
