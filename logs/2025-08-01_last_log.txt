Text:"Phi-Ground Tech Report: Advancing Perception in GUI GroundingWith the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents (CUAs), akin to Jarvis from "Iron Man", are becoming reality. GUI grounding is core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end grounding models still achieve less than 65% accuracy on challenging benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from being ready for deployment. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training. Ultimately, we developed the Phi-Ground model family, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models under 10B parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our model still achieves SOTA results with scores of 43.2 on ScreenSpot-pro and 27.2 on UI-Vision. We believe that the various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures, not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other perception tasks.

[ 1 9 7 7 3 2 . 7 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Left: The comparison chart of our grounding model results across five GUI grounding benchmarks. Our model, trained specifically for the agent setting, achieved SOTA results on all benchmarks under this focus. Even in the general end-to-end model setting, our model attained SOTA results on three of the benchmarks. Right: The relationship between model performance and computational cost on ScreenSpot-pro demonstrates that our model supports the Pareto frontier, indicating its efficiency. Most GUI research traditionally considers only the parameter count for comparison, but our experiments highlight that computational cost during testing, such as the number of image tokens, also significantly impacts performance. The X-axis in the right figure represents D, where is the number of image tokens. Training and inference latency are more linearly correlated with than with . graph using latency as the X-axis closely resembles the right figure, but latency is often influenced by hardware and acceleration libraries such as vllm, so we did not use latency as X-axis. Phi-Ground Tech Report Figure 2: Agent evolution across physical and virtual worlds. Traditional systems rely on fixed controllers and predefined workflows to execute domain-specific tasks, either in physical environments (e.g., task-specific robots) or virtual environments (e.g., API-based Web/APP agents). In the modern era, intelligent automation has emerged. In the physical world, general-purpose robots perform versatile limb-based operations. In the virtual world, Computer Use Agents (CUAs) achieve human-level behaviors through general purpose planner, GUI grounding, enabling them to complete any virtual task achievable via mouse and keyboard interactions.Large model based autonomous agents [1, 2], by leveraging their robust reasoning capabilities and interactions with real-world environments [3], enable humans to tackle more complex tasks and significantly enhance productivity. Given that substantial portion of modern human work is conducted via computers, Computer Use Agents (CUAs) hold immense potential and commercial value [4, 5]. While CUAs streamline virtual work, robots [6, 7] simplify physical tasks, as shown in Figure 2, and together, they are poised to drive revolution in productivity. With the development of reasoning models like O3 [8, 9, 10, 11], we are beginning to create prototypes of CUAs, such as OpenAI Operator [12] and Claude Computer Use [13]. However, there remains considerable gap before CUAs can be fully commercialized. This is due to the irreversible effects of many computer operations [14], such as closing unsaved files, as well as significant concerns regarding user privacy protection [15, 16, 17]. Specifically, CUAs can execute actions through the following methods: APIs (e.g., HTML/DOM, Office scripts), scripting tools (such as AutoHotkey, Power Automate, CLI), and simulated input device interactions (such as mouse clicks and keyboard inputs). Traditional approaches based on APIs [18, 19] and scripts are often constrained by the platform in use, environmental dependencies, and the specific APIs provided by applications [20]. In contrast, solutions based on GUI and simulated input device interactions [21] are aligned with human operations. This alignment not only facilitates user supervision, enhancing privacy and security, but also theoretically allows for any interaction that human can perform, without being limited by the application. As result, GUI-based CUAs are becoming focal point of research in this field, as illustrated in Figure 2. When accomplishing task, GUI-based CUA can be divided into two steps: temporal planning and grounding [22, 23]. Planning involves analyzing the task description and the current state to determine the actions that should be taken in the future, while grounding refers to the above mentioned simulation of input devices. Among all interactions, mouse click operations are the most important and common actions for GUI grounding. Since keyboard commands, such as pressing the "A" key, are discrete, MLLMs can effectively handle this type of grounding. Hence, our focus is primarily on mouse commands, where the main challenge lies in the fact that mouse command parameters are screen coordinates, and most MLLMs struggle to accurately identify these coordinates [24, 25, 26]. Therefore, specialized training is required for determining the precise click coordinates. 2 Phi-Ground Tech Report Figure 3: Three levels of task of CUAs. Each coral block represent an action step. We focus on the click action, as it is the most important and common operation. Others such as keyboard input can be effectively handled by MLLM. Motivated by the above considerations, this paper conducts detailed empirical study on the training of GUI grounding models. We divide GUI grounding into two components: the first component is spatial planning [27, 23], which involves identifying which specific element in the image needs to "

"The Phi-Ground model family achieves state-of-the-art performance in GUI grounding for multimodal reasoning models, improving accuracy across various benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents (CUAs), akin to Jarvis from "Iron Man", are becoming a reality. GUI grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training. Ultimately, we developed the Phi-Ground model family, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models under 10B parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textbf{43.2} on ScreenSpot-pro and \textbf{27.2} on UI-Vision. We believe that the various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures, not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other perception tasks.

Persona vectors in large language models can monitor and control personality changes during training and deployment, enabling the identification and mitigation of undesirable traits.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant' persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of interest, given only a natural-language description.

NeRF-GS combines Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting to enhance 3D scene representation and performance through joint optimization and shared spatial information.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization, limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene representation.
