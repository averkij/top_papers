Text:"Seed-Prover: Deep and Broad Reasoning for Automated Theorem Proving ByteDance Seed AI4MathLLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when solely using natural language. Dedicated domainspecific languages like Lean provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose Seed-Prover, lemmastyle whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning. Seed-Prover proves 78.1% of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F, and achieves over 50% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in Lean, we introduce geometry reasoning engine Seed-Geometry, which outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work represents significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long chain-of-thought reasoning. Project Page: https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Seed-Prover 5 2 0 2 1 3 ] A . [ 1 6 2 7 3 2 . 7 0 5 2 : r Figure 1 Growth in MiniF2F-Test performance over time.Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown extending reasoning lengths through natural language can significantly boost performance on math benchmarks such as MATH and AIME [4, 11]. Training such models requires reinforcement learning (RL) on verifiable answers. It is extremely difficult to automatically, or even manually, verify proof in natural language since each step must be carefully checked for correctness [13]. This poses significant challenges for applying reinforcement learning to the training of large language models to prove mathematical statements. Unlike natural language, formal languages such as Lean can provide clear and automatic signal on the correctness of formalized proof. noteworthy work from AlphaProof [3] uses Lean to successfully solve 3 problems from the 2024 International Mathematical Olympaid (IMO). AlphaProof demonstrates that LLMs using formal language are capable of proving very challenging problems that LLMs using natural language fail to prove. There are two types of LLM formal provers, step-level provers [3, 14, 22, 23, 25] and whole-proof generation provers[5, 24]. Step-level provers incrementally generate Lean code line-by-line. While this enables close interaction with the Lean environment, it requires special scaffolding to generate complete Lean proof, and the interaction is often too granular to allow high-level reasoning. In contrast, whole-proof models generate an entire Lean proof at once, but typically lack interaction with the Lean compiler. Recent work has shown that combining whole-proof models with long chain-of-thought reasoning [9, 15, 21] substantially outperforms step-level provers. In this work, we propose Seed-Prover, whole-proof model with following features: Lemma-Style Proving: Seed-Prover tries to generate useful intermediate lemmas before proving the main statement. These lemmas serve as shared knowledge across different inference paths. Iterative Proof Refinement: Seed-Prover iteratively refines its proof based on Lean compiler feedback, previous proved lemmas, and self-summarization. Test-Time Scaling: We implement three-tiered inference strategy that enables Seed-Prover to think both deeply and broadlyallocating thinking budget to fine details while exploring interesting properties. SOTA Performance: Seed-Prover proves 5 out of 6 problems in IMO 2025, saturates MiniF2F [31] (shown in Figure 1), and outperforms prior work by up to 3 on multiple formal benchmarks. Due to the lack of sufficient geometry support in Lean, Seed-Prover incorporates dedicated geometry reasoning engine Seed-Geometry. Similar to existing line of efforts in AlphaGeometry [2, 19] and TongGeometry [30], Seed-Geometry follows the forward-chaining design in the reasoning engine implementation, where the system derives all known facts by checking applicable rules until closure is reached. By backward-tracing fact dependencies, Seed-Geometry identifies the minimum dependency relations in geometry problems configuration, seperating the problem context from the auxiliary constructions necessary to prove problem. Using statistics derived from more than past 20 years of math olympiad competitions, Seed-Geometry performs extensive search in the geometry space defined by its dedicated domain-specific language and establishes repository of 230 million unique geometry problems requiring auxiliaries. Seed model trained on such dedicated geometry data becomes an exceptionally effective neuro-symbolic geometry prover, where it fills in the missing auxiliary geometry elements and the geometry reasoning engine performs step-by-step forwardchaining, completing the final proof of problem. In experiments, Seed-Geometry solves 43 of the IMO-AG-50 (vs. 42 by AlphaGeometry 2), benchmark that curates geometry problems of IMO from 2000 to 2024. It also sets new state-of-the-art on the IMO shortlist geometry problems from 2000 to 2022, and notably solves the geometry problem of IMO 2025 under just 2 seconds.Here we introduce the two systems we used in IMO 2025, Seed-Geometry and Seed-Prover."

Text:"Recommender systems are among the most impactful applications of artificial intelligence, serving as critical infrastructure connecting users, merchants, and platforms. However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant on historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectivesi.e., optimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent. This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical preferences, failing to capture users evolving and latent interests. As result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole recommendation ecosystem. To address these challenges, we rethink the overall design paradigm of recommender systems and propose RecGPT, next-generation framework that places user intent at the center of the recommendation pipeline. By integrating large language models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval, and explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into an intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the above domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates multi-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced pre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by Human-LLM cooperative judge system.

Text:"5 2 0 2 1 3 ] . [ 1 2 8 6 3 2 . 7 0 5 2 : r villa-X: Enhancing Latent Action Modeling in Vision-Language-Action Models Xiaoyu Chen2*, Hangxing Wei3*, Pushi Zhang1*, Chuheng Zhang1*, Kaixin Wang1*, Yanjiang Guo2, Rushuai Yang4, Yucen Wang5, Xinquan Xiao2, Li Zhao1*, Jianyu Chen2, and Jiang Bian1 1Microsoft Research, 2Tsinghua University, 3Wuhan University, 4Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, 5Nanjing University Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as popular paradigm for learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X, novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds significant promise, and that our villa-X provides strong foundation for future research. Keywords: Latent Action, Vision-Language-Action Model code: https://github.com/microsoft/villa-x site: https://aka.ms/villa-x Latent action learning has emerged as promising approach for the pretraining of vision-language-action (VLA) models [5, 11, 13, 30, 31, 35, 52, 68], enabling learning from both robot data and human video data [1, 11, 52, 67]. At the core of these methods is Latent Action Model (LAM), which compresses visual changes between successive frames into latent tokens, referred to as latent actions. These latent actions are expected to capture motion semantics."

"Seed-Prover, a lemma-style reasoning model using Lean, achieves high performance in formal theorem proving and automated mathematical reasoning through iterative refinement and specialized geometry support.  					AI-generated summary 				 LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose Seed-Prover, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning. Seed-Prover proves 78.1% of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F, and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine Seed-Geometry, which outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems.

RecGPT integrates large language models into recommender systems to focus on user intent, improving content diversity and satisfaction while enhancing merchant and platform performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recommender systems are among the most impactful applications of artificial intelligence, serving as critical infrastructure connecting users, merchants, and platforms. However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant on historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e., optimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent. This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical preferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole recommendation ecosystem.   To address these challenges, we rethink the overall design paradigm of recommender systems and propose RecGPT, a next-generation framework that places user intent at the center of the recommendation pipeline. By integrating large language models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval, and explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into an intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the above domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a multi-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced pre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative judge system. Currently, RecGPT has been fully deployed on the Taobao App. Online experiments demonstrate that RecGPT achieves consistent performance gains across stakeholders: users benefit from increased content diversity and satisfaction, merchants and the platform gain greater exposure and conversions. These comprehensive improvement results across all stakeholders validates that LLM-driven, intent-centric design can foster a more sustainable and mutually beneficial recommendation ecosystem.

The ViLLA framework enhances VLA models by incorporating latent actions, improving performance in both simulated and real-world robot manipulation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X, a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for future research.

A benchmark dataset for Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) in English and Chinese is presented to evaluate their performance in understanding and emulating human spoken conversations, addressing challenges like ambiguity and context-dependency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns. Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079 instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these practical challenges.

"A benchmark dataset for Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) in English and Chinese is presented to evaluate their performance in understanding and emulating human spoken conversations, addressing challenges like ambiguity and context-dependency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns. Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079 instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these practical challenges."

Softmax attention is more expressive than linear attention due to its recurrent form, which can be analyzed using RNN components.  					AI-generated summary 				 Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.
