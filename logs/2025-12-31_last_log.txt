We conduct extensive experiments with focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available. Figure 1. Scaling with context length, in terms of test loss (left) and latency (right). Left: Our method (TTT-E2E) turns the worst line (green) into the best (blue) at 128K context length. Loss (), the y-value, is computed as (loss of the reported method) (loss of Transformer with full attention), so loss of full attention itself (orange) is the flat line at = 0.

**Justification:**

1. **GRAPHS**: The paper explicitly proposes GraphLocator, which uses graph-based representations (causal issue graph with vertices and edges) and operates on repository graphs. Graph neural network concepts are central to the approach.

2. **REASONING**: The paper addresses reasoning over code dependencies and causal relationships. The approach involves "iteratively reasoning over neighboring vertices" and discovering causal dependencies, which relates to logical reasoning capabilities.

3. **SCIENCE**: The paper applies machine learning/NLP techniques to automated software engineering, which is a scientific application domain. It addresses the automation of software maintenance tasks, which falls under research automatization in the scientific/technical domain.

3. **SCIENCE**: The paper applies machine learning/NLP techniques to automated software engineering, which is a scientific application domain. It addresses the automation of software maintenance tasks, which falls under research automatization in the scientific/technical domain.
