[31.12.2025 04:39] Claude request. Model: claude-haiku-4-5. Prompt: Read an abstract of the ML paper and return a JSON with fields: 'desc': explanation of the paper in Russian (4 sentences), use correct machine learning terms. 'emoji': emoji that will reflect the theme of an article somehow, only one emoji. 'title': a slogan of a main idea of the article in Russian. Return only JSON and nothing else.

Recently unified generation and editing models have achieved remarkable success with their impressive performance. These models rely mainly on text prompts for instruction-based editing and generation, but language often fails to capture users intended edit locations and fine-grained visual details. To this end, we propose two tasks: scribble-based editing and generation, that enables more flexible creation on graphical user interface (GUI) combining user textual, images, and freehand sketches. We introduce DreamOmni3, tackling two challenges: data creation and framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline includes two parts: scribble-based editing and generation. For scribble-based editing, we define four tasks: scribble and instruction-based editing, scribble and multimodal instruction-based editing, image fusion, and doodle editing. Based on DreamOmni2 dataset, we extract editable regions and overlay hand-drawn boxes, circles, doodles or cropped image to construct training data. For scribble-based generation, we define three tasks: scribble and instruction-based generation, scribble and multimodal instruction-based generation, and doodle generation, following similar data creation pipelines. For the framework, instead of using binary masks, which struggle with complex edits involving multiple scribbles, images, and instructions, we propose a joint input scheme that feeds both the original and scribbled source images into the model, using different colors to distinguish regions and simplify processing. By applying the same index and position encodings to both images, the model can precisely localize scribbled regions while maintaining accurate editing. Finally, we establish comprehensive benchmarks for these tasks to promote further research. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamOmni3 achieves outstanding performance, and models and code will be publicly released.

Авторы предлагают инновационный подход к обработке входных данных, где вместо бинарных масок используется совместная схема, подающая исходное и размеченное изображения в модель с различными цветами для обозначения регионов. Они также разработали комплексный конвейер синтеза данных, включающий четыре типа редактирования и три типа генерации на основе рисунков.

**Justification:**

1. **SYNTHETIC**: The paper explicitly describes a "data synthesis pipeline" for creating training data through scribble-based editing and generation tasks. The authors construct training data by extracting editable regions and overlaying hand-drawn elements, which constitutes generating synthetic data for training purposes.

2. **OPEN_SOURCE**: The paper states "models and code will be publicly released," indicating a commitment to releasing models and code to the public, which aligns with the open-source contribution criterion.
