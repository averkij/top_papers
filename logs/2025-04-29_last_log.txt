Although contemporary text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in producing visually appealing images, their capacity to generate precise and flexible typographic elements, especially non-Latin alphabets, remains constrained. To address these limitations, we start from an naive assumption that text understanding is only a sufficient condition for text rendering, but not a necessary condition. Based on this, we present RepText, which aims to empower pre-trained monolingual text-to-image generation models with the ability to accurately render, or more precisely, replicate, multilingual visual text in user-specified fonts, without the need to really understand them. Specifically, we adopt the setting from ControlNet and additionally integrate language agnostic glyph and position of rendered text to enable generating harmonized visual text, allowing users to customize text content, font and position on their needs. To improve accuracy, a text perceptual loss is employed along with the diffusion loss. Furthermore, to stabilize rendering process, at the inference phase, we directly initialize with noisy glyph latent instead of random initialization, and adopt region masks to restrict the feature injection to only the text region to avoid distortion of the background. We conducted extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our RepText relative to existing works, our approach outperforms existing open-source methods and achieves comparable results to native multi-language closed-source models. To be more fair, we also exhaustively discuss its limitations in the end.

Mathematical geometric problem solving (GPS) often requires effective integration of multimodal information and verifiable logical coherence. Despite the fast development of large language models in general problem solving, it remains unresolved regarding with both methodology and benchmarks, especially given the fact that exiting synthetic GPS benchmarks are often not self-verified and contain noise and self-contradicted information due to the illusion of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a scalable data engine called TrustGeoGen for problem generation, with formal verification to provide a principled benchmark, which we believe lays the foundation for the further development of methods for GPS. The engine synthesizes geometric data through four key innovations: 1) multimodal-aligned generation of diagrams, textual descriptions, and stepwise solutions; 2) formal verification ensuring rule-compliant reasoning paths; 3) a bootstrapping mechanism enabling complexity escalation via recursive state generation and 4) our devised GeoExplore series algorithms simultaneously produce multi-solution variants and self-reflective backtracking traces. By formal logical verification, TrustGeoGen produces GeoTrust-200K dataset with guaranteed modality integrity, along with GeoTrust-test testset. Experiments reveal the state-of-the-art models achieve only 49.17\% accuracy on GeoTrust-test, demonstrating its evaluation stringency. Crucially, models trained on GeoTrust achieve OOD generalization on GeoQA, significantly reducing logical inconsistencies relative to pseudo-label annotated by OpenAI-o1.

Downsampling layers are crucial building blocks in CNN architectures, which help to increase the receptive field for learning high-level features and reduce the amount of memory/computation in the model. In this work, we study the generalization of the uniform downsampling layer for group equivariant architectures, e.g., G-CNNs. That is, we aim to downsample signals (feature maps) on general finite groups with anti-aliasing. This involves the following: (a) Given a finite group and a downsampling rate, we present an algorithm to form a suitable choice of subgroup. (b) Given a group and a subgroup, we study the notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing. Notably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical sampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our method recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed by a subsampling operation. Finally, we conducted experiments on image classification tasks demonstrating that the proposed downsampling operation improves accuracy, better preserves equivariance, and reduces model size when incorporated into G-equivariant networks
