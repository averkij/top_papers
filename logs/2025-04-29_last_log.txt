To overcome this limitation, we introduce MMInference (Multimodality Million tokens Inference), dynamic sparse attention method that accelerates the prefilling stage for long-context multi-modal inputs.

Preprint. 1 Figure 1: Dynamic sparse attention pipelines leverage sparse loading with dense computation (Zheng et al., 2023) to enable hardware-efficient acceleration. MMInference adopts bottom-up system-algorithm co-design that accounting for both the mathematical equivalence constraints of sparse loading and the locality properties of real-world attention patterns. 1. Introduction Scaling the context size of Vision Language Models (VLMs) allows them to handle extended temporal information from long video and text inputs, which is crucial for various applications including robotics (Black et al., 2024; Prasad et al., 2024; Cheang et al., 2024), autonomous driving (Hu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024c; Gao et al., 2024), and healthcare (Liu et al., 2024b). In addition, Zhang et al. (2024b) and Chen et al. (2025) show that scaling the context size of VLMs can improve the resolution in the temporal dimension and lead to better performance in video understanding tasks. However, due to the quadratic complexity of attention, processing long multi-modal inputs (i.e., the pre-fill stage) can take minutes prior to auto-regressive decoding. As shown in Fig. 2a, this leads to significant Time-to-First-Token latency, which hinders the wide adoption of long-context VLMs in real-world applications. Previous work (Child et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022; 2024a; Yuan et al., 2025; Lu et al., 2025) reMMInference: Accelerating Pre-filling for Long-Context VLMs via Modality-Aware Permutation Sparse Attention (a) VLMs attention incurs heavy cost. (b) VLMs attention is sparse. (c) Sparsity of VLMs attention is dynamic. Figure 2: (a) Latency breakdown of the pre-filling stage, with 256 tokens per frame. (b) How much element in attention needs to be computed to achieve 95% recall in 128k context. (c) Low attention recall when reusing the top-k indices from different request. Visualizations are based on LongVILA-7B-1M (Chen et al., 2025) with single A100. veals that attention matrices are typically sparse, prompting the development of sparse attention methods such as Sparse Transformer (Child et al., 2019), Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021), and StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2024). More recently, MInference (Jiang et al., 2024) proposes to use dynamic sparse attention that estimates the sparse index online, and leverages optimized GPU kernels for end-to-end acceleration. However, these methods fail to exploit the unique sparse patterns in long-context VLMs, and struggle with mixed or interleaved modalities, limiting their applicability without compromising performance. Unlike long-text contexts, video and image inputs in VLMs exhibit spatiotemporal locality, forming grid-like attention patterns with evenly spaced vertical and horizontal lines (Fig. 3a). In mixed-modality inputs, clear modality boundaries emerge: attention across modalities diverges significantly from intra-modality attention (Fig. 3b). These factors pose unique challenges for exploiting sparsity to accelerate the pre-fill stage. In this paper, we present MMInference, permutation-based dynamic sparse attention method that significantly reduces attention FLOPs, accelerating the pre-fill stage of longcontext VLMs. First, MMInference identifies the grid heads and leverages rowand column-wise permutation to gather the sparse grid for efficient hardware computation. Next, we detect Query-boundary and 2D-boundary patterns to address inter-modality boundary issues, and apply modality-wise permutation to isolate intra-modality regions. This results in consecutive sparse index within each modality, permitting efficient hardware implementation of sparse computing. Finally, Modality-Aware Sparse Attention Search Algorithm is devised to fine-tune both interand intra-modality patterns offline, to optimize performance with minimal overhead. We conduct extensive experiments using four state-of-theart long-context VLMs, Llava-Video (Zhang et al., 2024b), LongVila (Chen et al., 2025), VideoChat-Flash (Li et al., 2025) and Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025), across diverse video understanding tasks such as video captioning (Maaz et al., 2024), video question answering (Yu et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2021; Mangalam et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2024), and video information retrieval (Zhang et al., 2024a). Additionally, we propose the Mixed-Modality Needle in Hackathon task to assess multi-modal input performance. Our method effectively addresses modality boundaries, significantly accelerates the prefilling stage, and maintains high "
