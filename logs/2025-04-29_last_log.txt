Our findings highlight the critical role of structured, persistent memory mechanisms for long-term conversational coherence, paving the way for more reliable and efficient LLM-driven AI agents. Code can be found at: https://mem0.ai/research 1. Introduction Human memory is foundation of intelligenceit shapes our identity, guides decision-making, and enables us to learn, adapt, and form meaningful relationships (Craik and Jennings, 1992). Among its many roles, memory is essential for communication: we recall past interactions, infer preferences, and construct evolving mental models of those we engage with (Assmann, 2011). This ability to retain and retrieve information over extended periods enables coherent, contextually rich exchanges that span days, weeks, or even months. AI agents, powered by large language models (LLMs), have made remarkable progress in generating fluent, contextually appropriate responses (Yu et al., 2024, Zhang et al., 2024). However, these systems are fundamentally limited by their reliance on fixed context windows, which severely restrict their ability to maintain coherence over extended interactions (Bulatov et al., 2022, Liu et al., 2023). This limitation stems from LLMs lack of persistent memory mechanisms that can extend beyond their finite context windows. While humans naturally accumulate and organize experiences over time, forming continuous narrative Mem0: Building Production-Ready AI Agents with Scalable Long-Term Memory Figure 1: Illustration of memory importance in AI agents. Left: Without persistent memory, the system forgets critical user information (vegetarian, dairy-free preferences) between sessions, resulting in inappropriate recommendations. Right: With effective memory, the system maintains these dietary preferences across interactions, enabling contextually appropriate suggestions that align with previously established constraints. of interactions, AI systems cannot inherently persist information across separate sessions or after context overflow. The absence of persistent memory creates fundamental disconnect in human-AI interaction. Without memory, AI agents forget user preferences, repeat questions, and contradict previously established facts. Consider simple example illustrated in Figure 1, where user mentions being vegetarian and avoiding dairy products in an initial conversation. In subsequent session, when the user asks about dinner recommendations, system without persistent memory might suggest chicken, completely contradicting the established dietary preferences. In contrast, system with persistent memory would maintain this critical user information across sessions and suggest appropriate vegetarian, dairy-free options. This common scenario highlights how memory failures can fundamentally undermine user experience and trust. Beyond conversational settings, memory mechanisms have been shown to dramatically enhance agent performance in interactive environments (Majumder et al., Shinn et al., 2023). Agents equipped with memory of past experiences can better anticipate user needs, learn from previous mistakes, and generalize knowledge across tasks (Chhikara et al., 2023). Research demonstrates that memory-augmented agents improve decision-making by leveraging causal relationships between actions and outcomes, leading to more effective adaptation in dynamic scenarios (Rasmussen et al., 2025). Hierarchical memory architectures (Packer et al., 2023, Sarthi et al., 2024) and agentic memory systems capable of autonomous evolution (Xu et al., 2025) have further shown that memory enables more coherent, long-term reasoning across multiple dialogue sessions. Unlike humans, who dynamically integrate new information and revise outdated beliefs, LLMs effectively reset" once information falls outside their context window (Zhang, 2024, Timoneda and Vera, 2025). Even as models like OpenAIs GPT-4 (128K tokens) (Hurst et al., 2024), o1 (200K context) (Jaech et al., 2024), Anthropics Claude 3.7 Sonnet (200K tokens) (Anthropic, 2025), and Googles Gemini (at least 10M tokens) (Team et al., 2024) push the boundaries of context length, these improvements merely delay rather than solve the fundamental limitation. In practical applications, even these extended context windows prove insufficient for two critical reasons. First, as meaningful human-AI relationships develop over weeks or months, conversation history inevitably exceeds even the most generous context limits. Second, and perhaps more importantly, real-world conversation"

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess in generating contextually coherent responses, yet their fixed context windows pose fundamental challenges for maintaining consistency over prolonged multi-session dialogues. We introduce Mem0, a scalable memory-centric architecture that addresses this issue by dynamically extracting, consolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations. Building on this foundation, we further propose an enhanced variant that leverages graph-based memory representations to capture complex relational structures among conversational elements. Through comprehensive evaluations on LOCOMO benchmark, we systematically compare our approaches against six baseline categories: (i) established memory-augmented systems, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with varying chunk sizes and k-values, (iii) a full-context approach that processes the entire conversation history, (iv) an open-source memory solution, (v) a proprietary model system, and (vi) a dedicated memory management platform. Empirical results show that our methods consistently outperform all existing memory systems across four question categories: single-hop, temporal, multi-hop, and open-domain. Notably, Mem0 achieves 26% relative improvements in the LLM-as-a-Judge metric over OpenAI, while Mem0 with graph memory achieves around 2% higher overall score than the base configuration. Beyond accuracy gains, we also markedly reduce computational overhead compared to full-context method. In particular, Mem0 attains a 91% lower p95 latency and saves more than 90% token cost, offering a compelling balance between advanced reasoning capabilities and practical deployment constraints. Our findings highlight critical role of structured, persistent memory mechanisms for long-term conversational coherence, paving the way for more reliable and efficient LLM-driven AI agents.

Эмпирические результаты показывают, что Mem0 превосходит существующие системы памяти по четырем категориям вопросов, достигая 26% относительного улучшения по метрике LLM-as-a-Judge по сравнению с OpenAI. Кроме того, Mem0 значительно снижает вычислительные затраты, предлагая баланс между продвинутыми возможностями рассуждений и практическими ограничениями развертывания.",
