Text:"5 2 0 2 4 1 ] . [ 1 1 4 5 0 1 . 7 0 5 2 : r REST: Stress Testing Large Reasoning Models by Asking Multiple Problems at Once Zhuoshi Pan1,2,, Qizhi Pei2,3,, Yu Li2 Qiyao Sun2 Zinan Tang2 H. Vicky Zhao1, Conghui He2, Lijun Wu2, 1Tsinghua University, 2OpenDataLab, Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, 3Renmin University of China Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on task-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by isolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess single-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical limitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly and perpetual creation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate models under multicontext pressure, key requirement for real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through Simultaneous Testing), stress-testing framework that concurrently exposes LRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST specifically evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority allocation, crossproblem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load management. Our evaluation across 34 advanced reasoning models on 7 reasoning benchmarks reveals several striking findings: Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance degradation under stress testing, challenging the prevailing assumption that LLMs are multi-problem solvers. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger discriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance differences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under single-question evaluations. Some key mechanistic insights emerge from our analysis: (1) the overthinking trap is critical factor contributing to the performance degradation; (2) "

Korean expert-level benchmarks, KMMLU-Redux and KMMLU-Pro, are introduced to evaluate Large Language Models across academic and industrial domains in Korea.  					AI-generated summary 				 The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires robust benchmarks that encompass not only academic domains but also industrial fields to effectively evaluate their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce two Korean expert-level benchmarks. KMMLU-Redux, reconstructed from the existing KMMLU, consists of questions from the Korean National Technical Qualification exams, with critical errors removed to enhance reliability. KMMLU-Pro is based on Korean National Professional Licensure exams to reflect professional knowledge in Korea. Our experiments demonstrate that these benchmarks comprehensively represent industrial knowledge in Korea. We release our dataset publicly available.

KMMLU-Redux основан на вопросах из корейских национальных технических квалификационных экзаменов, а KMMLU-Pro - на экзаменах для получения профессиональных лицензий. Эти тесты охватывают как академические, так и промышленные области знаний в Корее. Эксперименты показали, что данные бенчмарки комплексно отражают профессиональные знания в корейской индустрии.",

"Korean expert-level benchmarks, KMMLU-Redux and KMMLU-Pro, are introduced to evaluate Large Language Models across academic and industrial domains in Korea.  					AI-generated summary 				 The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires robust benchmarks that encompass not only academic domains but also industrial fields to effectively evaluate their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce two Korean expert-level benchmarks. KMMLU-Redux, reconstructed from the existing KMMLU, consists of questions from the Korean National Technical Qualification exams, with critical errors removed to enhance reliability. KMMLU-Pro is based on Korean National Professional Licensure exams to reflect professional knowledge in Korea. Our experiments demonstrate that these benchmarks comprehensively represent industrial knowledge in Korea. We release our dataset publicly available."
