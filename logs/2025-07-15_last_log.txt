Introduction 5 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 7 6 2 8 0 . 7 0 5 2 : r Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities.

This paper introduces practical and effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary, not competing, roles: prolonged SFT phase first pushes the models accuracy to its limits, after which GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks, including high rank among over 2, 200 teams in the strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO).

Correspondence to: Yuichi Inoue <y.inoue@sakana.ai>. The second AI for MATH Workshop at the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada. 2025. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 The remarkable advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential across vast spectrum of applications. Beyond their well-established capabilities in natural language understanding and conversation, the frontier of AI research is increasingly focused on enhancing their reasoning abilities, which are essential to solve complex and challenging problems (Qwen-Team, 2024; OpenAI, 2024; 2025; DeepSeek-AI, 2025). Among the diverse domains for evaluating reasoning, mathematical problem-solving stands out as an ideal testbed. It demands not only factual knowledge but also complex interplay of strategic planning, step-by-step logical inference, and selfcorrection, thereby providing comprehensive benchmark for the problem-solving capabilities of current models. To enhance the mathematical reasoning of LLMs, two primary paradigms have been explored: Supervised FineTuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). SFT, which uses high-quality step-by-step solutions datasets, has been instrumental in the bootstrapping of model capabilities (Chen et al., 2024; Qwen-Team, 2024). However, its effectiveness is intrinsically tied to the scale and quality of the demonstration data, potentially leading to performance plateau. On the other hand, RL offers promising avenue for models to learn from their own generated solutions, moving beyond the confines of static datasets. Recently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged, showing promise in improving sampling efficiency (Shao et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI, 2025). Yet, it remains unclear whether GRPO alone is sufficient to maximize performance, and principled, systematic methodology for combining it with SFT is notably absent. This paper bridges this gap by proposing practical recipe that strategically integrates SFT and GRPO to unlock new levels of mathematical reasoning in LLMs. We posit that these two methods are not competing but rather play highly complementary roles. Our core idea is that an extended SFT phase is first employed to establish strong performance baseline, which is then refined by GRPO phase focused on enhancing efficiency without compromising accuracy. This sequential and synergistic approach provides clear, reproducible pathway for developing high-performing Practical Two-Stage Recipe for Mathematical LLMs mathematical reasoners. Our investigation yields several key insights into the effective training of mathematical LLMs. First, we experimentally demonstrate that prolonged SFT is crucial for performance breakthroughs. Contrary to the common practice of short-duration fine-tuning such as cold start, we find that although initial epochs may show temporary dip in performance, extending the SFT process for as long as 10 epochs consistently and significantly boosts the models problem-solving accuracy. Second, we uncover new primary role for GRPO in this combined framework. While prior work often associates preference optimization with direct accuracy gains, our findings indicate that GRPO excels at dramatically improving token efficiency. After our intensive SFT stage, GRPO maintains or slightly improves the high accuracy achieved, while substantially shortening the length of generated solutions. Third, we establish clear synergistic relationship: SFT is responsible for pushing the performance ceiling of the model, while GRPO is responsible for optimizing the solution generation process, making the high-performing model more practical and efficient for real-world applications. To validate the efficacy of our proposed recipe, we conduct extensive evaluations on suite of challenging benchmarks, including AIME 2024 and AIME 2025. Crucially, we also test our model on the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) (Frieder et al., 2024), one of the most competitive benchmarks with stringent measures against data leakage. Our method achieves top-tier performance, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and robustness in highly competitive setting. These results not only underscore the power of our combined SFT-GRPO strategy but also offer the community valuable, battle-tested recipe for advancing the frontiers of mathematical reasoning with LLMs. To support the reproducibility of our work, we will release key artifacts at https://github.com/analokmaus/kaggleaimo2-fast-math-r1.

"A combination of extended supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from online inference enhances the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models, achieving top-tier performance on benchmarks like the AI Mathematical Olympiad.  					AI-generated summary 				 Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary, not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will open-source our entire framework, including all code, model checkpoints, and training configurations at https://github.com/analokmaus/kaggle-aimo2-fast-math-r1."
