Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) have made remarkable advancements in comprehending video content for QA dialogue. However, they struggle to extend this visual understanding to tasks requiring precise temporal localization, known as Video Temporal Grounding (VTG). To address this gap, we introduce Number-Prompt (NumPro), a novel method that empowers Vid-LLMs to bridge visual comprehension with temporal grounding by adding unique numerical identifiers to each video frame. Treating a video as a sequence of numbered frame images, NumPro transforms VTG into an intuitive process: flipping through manga panels in sequence. This allows Vid-LLMs to "read" event timelines, accurately linking visual content with corresponding temporal information. Our experiments demonstrate that NumPro significantly boosts VTG performance of top-tier Vid-LLMs without additional computational cost. Furthermore, fine-tuning on a NumPro-enhanced dataset defines a new state-of-the-art for VTG, surpassing previous top-performing methods by up to 6.9\% in mIoU for moment retrieval and 8.5\% in mAP for highlight detection. The code will be available at https://github.com/yongliang-wu/NumPro.

The recently released model, Claude 3.5 Computer Use, stands out as the first frontier AI model to offer computer use in public beta as a graphical user interface (GUI) agent. As an early beta, its capability in the real-world complex environment remains unknown. In this case study to explore Claude 3.5 Computer Use, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed tasks spanning a variety of domains and software. Observations from these cases demonstrate Claude 3.5 Computer Use's unprecedented ability in end-to-end language to desktop actions. Along with this study, we provide an out-of-the-box agent framework for deploying API-based GUI automation models with easy implementation. Our case studies aim to showcase a groundwork of capabilities and limitations of Claude 3.5 Computer Use with detailed analyses and bring to the fore questions about planning, action, and critic, which must be considered for future improvement. We hope this preliminary exploration will inspire future research into the GUI agent community. All the test cases in the paper can be tried through the project: https://github.com/showlab/computer_use_ootb.

"The recently released model, Claude 3.5 Computer Use, stands out as the first frontier AI model to offer computer use in public beta as a graphical user interface (GUI) agent. As an early beta, its capability in the real-world complex environment remains unknown. In this case study to explore Claude 3.5 Computer Use, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed tasks spanning a variety of domains and software. Observations from these cases demonstrate Claude 3.5 Computer Use's unprecedented ability in end-to-end language to desktop actions. Along with this study, we provide an out-of-the-box agent framework for deploying API-based GUI automation models with easy implementation. Our case studies aim to showcase a groundwork of capabilities and limitations of Claude 3.5 Computer Use with detailed analyses and bring to the fore questions about planning, action, and critic, which must be considered for future improvement. We hope this preliminary exploration will inspire future research into the GUI agent community. All the test cases in the paper can be tried through the project: https://github.com/showlab/computer_use_ootb."
