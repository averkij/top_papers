[ 1 8 3 4 0 1 . 1 1 4 2 : r MARS: Unleashing the Power of Variance Reduction for Training Large Models Huizhuo Yuan Yifeng Liu Shuang Wu Xun Zhou Quanquan Gu Abstract Training deep neural networksand more recently, large modelsdemands efficient and scalable optimizers. Adaptive gradient algorithms like Adam, AdamW, and their variants have been central to this task. Despite the development of numerous variance reduction algorithms in the past decade aimed at accelerating stochastic optimization in both convex and nonconvex settings, variance reduction has not found widespread success in training deep neural networks or large language models. Consequently, it has remained less favored approach in modern AI. In this paper, to unleash the power of variance reduction for efficient training of large models, we propose unified optimization framework, MARS (Make vAriance Reduction Shine), which reconciles preconditioned gradient methods with variance reduction via scaled stochastic recursive momentum technique. Within our framework, we introduce three instances of MARS that leverage preconditioned gradient updates based on AdamW, Lion, and Shampoo, respectively. We also draw connection between our algorithms and existing optimizers. Experimental results on training GPT-2 models indicate that MARS consistently outperforms AdamW by large margin. Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam (Kingma, 2014) and AdamW (Loshchilov, 2017) have become the predominant optimization algorithms in deep learning. With the surge of large language models, the majority of the renowned models, including GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), GPT-3 (Brown, 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and Llama 3 (Dubey et al., 2024) are trained with adaptive gradient methods. Numerous efforts have been made to improve adaptive gradient methods from both first-order and second-order optimization perspectives. For example, You et al. (2019) introduced LAMB, layerwise adaptation technique that boosts t"
