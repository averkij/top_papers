Text:"Region-Aware Text-to-Image Generation via Hard Binding and Soft Refinement Zhennan Chen1 Yajie Li1 Haofan Wang2,3 Zhibo Chen3 Zhengkai Jiang4 Jun Li1 Qian Wang5 Jian Yang1 Ying Tai1(cid:66) 4 2 0 2 0 ] .

RAG decouples raw prompts into regional prompts, processes different regions separately and strengthens the interaction between adjacent regions. It enables precise control over object relationship, action and attributes, achieving more harmonious and consistent complex compositional generation compared to competing models like FLUX and RPG. Abstract In this paper, we present RAG, Regional-Aware text-toimage Generation method conditioned on regional descriptions for precise layout composition. Regional prompting, or compositional generation, which enables fine-grained spatial control, has gained increasing attention for its practicality in real-world applications. However, previous methods either introduce additional trainable modules, thus only applicable to specific models, or manipulate on score maps within cross-attention layers using attention masks, resulting in limited control strength when the number of regions increases. To handle these limitations, we decouple the multi-region generation into two sub-tasks, the construction of individual region (Regional Hard Binding) that ensures the regional prompt is properly executed, and the overall detail refinement (Regional Soft Refinement) over regions that dismiss the visual boundaries and enhance adjacent interactions. Furthermore, RAG novelly makes repainting feasible, where users can modify specific unsatisfied regions in the last generation while keeping all other regions unchanged, without relying on additional inpainting models. Our approach is tuning-free and applicable to other frameworks as an enhancement to the prompt following property. Quantitative and qualita"
