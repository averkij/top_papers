[30.10.2024 06:34] [Experimental] Generating an image for paper AutoKaggle: A Multi-Agent Framework for Autonomous Data Science Competitions.
[30.10.2024 06:34] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'AutoKaggle: A Multi-Agent Framework for Autonomous Data Science Competitions' Text: 'Data science tasks involving tabular data present complex challenges that require sophisticated problem-solving approaches. We propose AutoKaggle, a powerful and user-centric framework that assists data scientists in completing daily data pipelines through a collaborative multi-agent system. AutoKaggle implements an iterative development process that combines code execution, debugging, and comprehensive unit testing to ensure code correctness and logic consistency. The framework offers highly customizable workflows, allowing users to intervene at each phase, thus integrating automated intelligence with human expertise. Our universal data science toolkit, comprising validated functions for data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling, forms the foundation of this solution, enhancing productivity by streamlining common tasks. We selected 8 Kaggle competitions to simulate data processing workflows in real-world application scenarios. Evaluation results demonstrate that AutoKaggle achieves a validation submission rate of 0.85 and a comprehensive score of 0.82 in typical data science pipelines, fully proving its effectiveness and practicality in handling complex data science tasks.'
[30.10.2024 06:34] Response: **Prompt:** Create a linear art scene on a white background featuring a surreal landscape where abstract representations of data pipelines intertwine with multi-agent figures collaborating around a giant, whimsical data wand. The figures should embody human expertise and automated intelligence, with exaggerated features and expressions of contemplation and creativity. Include elements like floating tables with chaotic datasets, colorful feature engineering tools, and ethereal clouds of code snippets hovering above. The text label for the central object, resembling a whimsical trophy, reads: "AutoKaggle: A Multi-Agent Framework for Autonomous Data Science Competitions".

Machine Unlearning (MU) is critical for enhancing privacy and security in deep learning models, particularly in large multimodal language models (MLLMs), by removing specific private or hazardous information. While MU has made significant progress in textual and visual modalities, multimodal unlearning (MMU) remains significantly underexplored, partially due to the absence of a suitable open-source benchmark. To address this, we introduce CLEAR, a new benchmark designed to evaluate MMU methods. CLEAR contains 200 fictitious individuals and 3,700 images linked with corresponding question-answer pairs, enabling a thorough evaluation across modalities. We assess 10 MU methods, adapting them for MMU, and highlight new challenges specific to multimodal forgetting. We also demonstrate that simple ell_1 regularization on LoRA weights significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting, preserving model performance on retained data. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/therem/CLEAR
