Text:"5 2 0 2 4 2 ] . [ 1 1 6 7 7 1 . 4 0 5 2 : r Step1X-Edit: Practical Framework for General Image Editing Step1X-Image Team StepFun https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step1X-EditIn recent years, image editing technology has witnessed remarkable and rapid development. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling vast majority of user - driven editing requirements, marking significant advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there are still large gap between the open-sourced algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in this paper, we target to release state-of-the-art image editing model, called Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and users editing instruction. latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we build data generation pipeline to produce high-quality dataset. For evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, novel benchmark rooted in real-world user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by substantial margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making significant contributions to the field of image editing.Image editing with natural language instructions has become an increasingly important task in vision-language research. It offers intuitive interaction for end users while posing unique technical challenges: understanding nuanced semantics, precisely localizing regions to edit, and preserving image fidelity. While diffusion models have dramatically improved image generation quality, the existing design by integrating text encoder, e.g., CLIP [33] and T5 [34], with diffusion transformer often struggles with following editing instruction to maintain alignment between input image and edit instruction, especially when edit instructions are subtle or compositional. Recent advances in proprietary multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o [29], Gemini2 Flash [14], and SeedEdit/Doubao [41], have pushed the frontier of instruction-based image editing. These systems leverage large-scale vision-language modeling capabilities to perform high-fidelity edits across diverse scenarios. However, their closed nature limits reproducibility and transparency. In parallel, open-source efforts like OmniGen [51] and ACE++ [27] aim to replicate similar capabilities but still fall short in terms of overall generalization, edit accuracy, and the quality of generated images. In this work, we aim to narrow the performance gap between open-source and closed-source editing systems, while also pushing the boundary of practical and user-grounded editing evaluation. Although researchers have open-sourced editing datasets like AnyEdit [55] and OmniEdit [49], we argue that the quality and diversity of these datasets are not good enough to obtain comparable performance against the close-source algorithms like GPT-4o. Thus, to target the image edit problem, we first try to build large-scale high quality dataset for training. More specifically, we identify 11 major Figure 1: Overview of Step1X-Edit. Step1X-Edit is an open-source general editing model that achieves proprietary-level performance with comprehensive editing capabilities. editing task categories based on the commonly used editing instructions. Guided by this taxonomy, we develop scalable and flexible data pipeline to generate over 1 million high-quality training data. These image-instruction pairs encompass broad spectrum of editing operations, including object manipulation, attribute modification, layout adjustment, and stylization, ensuring comprehensive coverage of real-world editing scenarios. Building on this dataset, we propose, Step1X-Edit, unified image editing model that combines the strong semantic reasoning of Multimedia Large Language Model (MLLM), e.g., Qwen-VL [3], with DiT-style diffusion architecture. The reference image and editing prompts can be processed by the MLLM to generate target image latent condition which will be integrated with the diffusion model to obtain the output image. Our approach maintains good balance between reference image reconstruction and editing prompt following. To train the model, we start from text-to-image model to retain aesthetic quality and visual consistency, which can be easily replace by the existing text-to-image models like SD3 [11] and FLUX[6]. To evaluate the existing editing models, we introduce new benchmark named GEdit-Bench. By carefully collecting the images and editing prompts, GEdit-Bench ensures both real-world editing requirements and the diversity of the editing prompts. The experiments on GEdit-Bench validate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open2 source baselines with large-margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, e.g., GPT-4o. In summary, there will be three contributions of our work: We will open-source our Step1X-Edit model, to reduce the performance gap between open-source and closed-source image editing systems and boost further research in the field of image editing. data generation pipeline is designed to produce high-quality image editing data. It ensures that the dataset is diverse, representative, and of sufficient quality to support the development of effective image editing models. The availability of such pipeline provides valuable resource for researchers and developers working on similar projects. new benchmark, named GEdit-Bench, grounded in real-world usages is developed to support more authentic and comprehensive evaluation. This benchmark, which is carefully curated to reflect actual user editing needs and wide range of editing scenarios, enables more authentic and comprehensive evaluations of image editing models.Autoregressive (AR) models have been actively studied for controllable image generation and editing by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. Works such as ControlAR [23], ControlVAR [21], and CAR [54] incorporate spatial and pixel-level guidancelike edges, segmentation masks, or depth mapsinto the decoding process, enabling more structured and localized control.

The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) framework has become a widely used approach for multimodal representation learning, particularly in image-text retrieval and clustering. However, its efficacy is constrained by three key limitations: (1) text token truncation, (2) isolated image-text encoding, and (3) deficient compositionality due to bag-of-words behavior. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in generalized vision-language understanding, their potential for learning transferable multimodal representations remains underexplored.In this work, we present UniME (Universal Multimodal Embedding), a novel two-stage framework that leverages MLLMs to learn discriminative representations for diverse downstream tasks. In the first stage, we perform textual discriminative knowledge distillation from a powerful LLM-based teacher model to enhance the embedding capability of the MLLM\'s language component. In the second stage, we introduce hard negative enhanced instruction tuning to further advance discriminative representation learning. Specifically, we initially mitigate false negative contamination and then sample multiple hard negatives per instance within each batch, forcing the model to focus on challenging samples. This approach not only improves discriminative power but also enhances instruction-following ability in downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, including short and long caption retrieval and compositional retrieval. Results demonstrate that UniME achieves consistent performance improvement across all tasks, exhibiting superior discriminative and compositional capabilities.

In the first stage, we perform textual discriminative knowledge distillation from a powerful LLM-based teacher model to enhance the embedding capability of the MLLM\'s language component. In the second stage, we introduce hard negative enhanced instruction tuning to further advance discriminative representation learning. Specifically, we initially mitigate false negative contamination and then sample multiple hard negatives per instance within each batch, forcing the model to focus on challenging samples. This approach not only improves discriminative power but also enhances instruction-following ability in downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, including short and long caption retrieval and compositional retrieval. Results demonstrate that UniME achieves consistent performance improvement across all tasks, exhibiting superior discriminative and compositional capabilities."

"The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) framework has become a widely used approach for multimodal representation learning, particularly in image-text retrieval and clustering.

We present a framework for perspective-aware reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) through mental imagery simulation. Perspective-taking, the ability to perceive an environment or situation from an alternative viewpoint, is a key benchmark for human-level visual understanding, essential for environmental interaction and collaboration with autonomous agents. Despite advancements in spatial reasoning within VLMs, recent research has shown that modern VLMs significantly lack perspective-aware reasoning capabilities and exhibit a strong bias toward egocentric interpretations. To bridge the gap between VLMs and human perception, we focus on the role of mental imagery, where humans perceive the world through abstracted representations that facilitate perspective shifts. Motivated by this, we propose a framework for perspective-aware reasoning, named Abstract Perspective Change (APC), that effectively leverages vision foundation models, such as object detection, segmentation, and orientation estimation, to construct scene abstractions and enable perspective transformations. Our experiments on synthetic and real-image benchmarks, compared with various VLMs, demonstrate significant improvements in perspective-aware reasoning with our framework, further outperforming fine-tuned spatial reasoning models and novel-view-synthesis-based approaches.
