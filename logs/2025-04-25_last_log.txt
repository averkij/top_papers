This process addresses critical challenges by reducing computational demands, improving visualization, and highlighting essential structures while filtering out noise. By focusing on the most relevant patterns, dimensionality reduction facilitates efficient computation and enhances the understanding of high-dimensional datasets. Over the years, numerous techniques have been developed for dimensionality reduction, ranging from classical linear approaches to advanced nonlinear methods. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [Hotelling, 1933], one of the earliest and most influential techniques, employs linear transformation to project data onto orthogonal axes that maximize variance. PCA is valued for its computational efficiency, scalability, and ease of interpretation, as the principal components are linear combinations of the original features. However, its reliance on linearity often limits its ability to capture non-linear relationships. To overcome these limitations, non-linear methods have been developed to capture complex patterns in high-dimensional data. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) [Van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008], for example, is extensively used for visualizing high-dimensional data. By optimizing model that preserves local similarities, t-SNE generates informative embeddings. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) [McInnes et al., 2018] leverages manifold learning to preserve both local and global data structures effectively. Other notable methods, including Isomap [Tenenbaum et al., 2000] and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) [Roweis and Saul, 2000], demonstrate strong representational capacity, revealing complex patterns in data. However, these methods often lack interpretability, and some, like tSNE, cannot extend their transformations to new data without retraining. While UMAP, Isomap, and LLE can extend transformations, they come with varying degrees of computational overhead. Deep learning have further expanded the toolkit for dimensionality reduction, with autoencoders [Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006] representing common approach. Autoencoders, neural network architectures designed to encode data into compressed latent space and decode it back to the original space, offer remarkable representational capacity by capturing complex relationships within data. However, they often require substantial amounts of data and lack interpretability. Despite these advancements, gap remains in developing methods that combine the representational power of non-linear approaches with the inter2 pretability of linear techniques, motivating the need for new solutions.2.1.1 Core Transformation Construct non-linear transformation from Rd1 to Rd2 (where d2 < d1) by combining multiple linear transformations through Gaussian weighting. Each linear transformation is assigned Gaussian function. For an input vector Rd1, the transformation is defined as: (x) = (cid:88) i=1 wi(x)Ti(x) (1) where is the number of linear transformations with corresponding weight functions, wi(x) are weights, and Ti : Rd1 Rd2 are linear transformations. 2.1.2 Gaussian Weight Computation The weight wi(x) for each transformation is computed using Gaussian function: (cid:18) gi(x) = exp (cid:19) µi2 σ2 These weights are then normalized to sum to 1: wi(x) = gi(x) j=1 gj(x) + ϵ (cid:80)m where: (2) (3) σi, the standard deviation, is optimized during training. ϵ is small constant added for numerical stability. µi Rd1 represents the center of the i-th Gaussian function, initialized through random sampling from the input dataset . By default, these centers remain fixed during optimization. 3 2.1.3 Linear Transformations Each Ti is linear transformation represented by matrix Mi Rd1d2. The transformation of point by Ti is computed as: Ti(x) = Mix (4)"

To address this, we present Token-Shuffle, novel yet simple method that reduces the number of image tokens in Transformers. Our key insight is the dimensional redundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where low-dimensional visual codes from the visual encoder are directly mapped to high-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key operations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel dimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which untangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial arrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy requires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support extremely high-resolution image synthesis in unified next-token prediction framework while maintaining efficient training and inference.

Quality and diversity are two critical metrics for the training data of large language models (LLMs), positively impacting performance. Existing studies often optimize these metrics separately, typically by first applying quality filtering and then adjusting data proportions. However, these approaches overlook the inherent trade-off between quality and diversity, necessitating their joint consideration. Given a fixed training quota, it is essential to evaluate both the quality of each data point and its complementary effect on the overall dataset. In this paper, we introduce a unified data selection framework called QuaDMix, which automatically optimizes the data distribution for LLM pretraining while balancing both quality and diversity. Specifically, we first propose multiple criteria to measure data quality and employ domain classification to distinguish data points, thereby measuring overall diversity. QuaDMix then employs a unified parameterized data sampling function that determines the sampling probability of each data point based on these quality and diversity related labels. To accelerate the search for the optimal parameters involved in the QuaDMix framework, we conduct simulated experiments on smaller models and use LightGBM for parameters searching, inspired by the RegMix method. Our experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that QuaDMix achieves an average performance improvement of 7.2% across multiple benchmarks. These results outperform the independent strategies for quality and diversity, highlighting the necessity and ability to balance data quality and diversity.

Given a fixed training quota, it is essential to evaluate both the quality of each data point and its complementary effect on the overall dataset. In this paper, we introduce a unified data selection framework called QuaDMix, which automatically optimizes the data distribution for LLM pretraining while balancing both quality and diversity. Specifically, we first propose multiple criteria to measure data quality and employ domain classification to distinguish data points, thereby measuring overall diversity. QuaDMix then employs a unified parameterized data sampling function that determines the sampling probability of each data point based on these quality and diversity related labels. To accelerate the search for the optimal parameters involved in the QuaDMix framework, we conduct simulated experiments on smaller models and use LightGBM for parameters searching, inspired by the RegMix method. Our experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that QuaDMix achieves an average performance improvement of 7.2% across multiple benchmarks. These results outperform the independent strategies for quality and diversity, highlighting the necessity and ability to balance data quality and diversity."

Dimensionality reduction techniques are fundamental for analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional data. With established methods like t-SNE and PCA presenting a trade-off between representational power and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel approach that bridges this gap by combining the interpretability of linear methods with the expressiveness of non-linear transformations. The proposed algorithm constructs a non-linear mapping between high-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces through a combination of linear transformations, each weighted by Gaussian functions. This architecture enables complex non-linear transformations while preserving the interpretability advantages of linear methods, as each transformation can be analyzed independently. The resulting model provides both powerful dimensionality reduction and transparent insights into the transformed space. Techniques for interpreting the learned transformations are presented, including methods for identifying suppressed dimensions and how space is expanded and contracted. These tools enable practitioners to understand how the algorithm preserves and modifies geometric relationships during dimensionality reduction. To ensure the practical utility of this algorithm, the creation of user-friendly software packages is emphasized, facilitating its adoption in both academia and industry.

Autoregressive (AR) models, long dominant in language generation, are increasingly applied to image synthesis but are often considered less competitive than Diffusion-based models. A primary limitation is the substantial number of image tokens required for AR models, which constrains both training and inference efficiency, as well as image resolution. To address this, we present Token-Shuffle, a novel yet simple method that reduces the number of image tokens in Transformer. Our key insight is the dimensional redundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where low-dimensional visual codes from visual encoder are directly mapped to high-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key operations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel dimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which untangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial arrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy requires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support extremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction way while maintaining efficient training and inference. For the first time, we push the boundary of AR text-to-image generation to a resolution of 2048x2048 with gratifying generation performance. In GenAI-benchmark, our 2.7B model achieves 0.77 overall score on hard prompts, outperforming AR models LlamaGen by 0.18 and diffusion models LDM by 0.15. Exhaustive large-scale human evaluations also demonstrate our prominent image generation ability in terms of text-alignment, visual flaw, and visual appearance. We hope that Token-Shuffle can serve as a foundational design for efficient high-resolution image generation within MLLMs.
