First, they overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on mathematical problemsolving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning skillsincluding abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal capabilitiesrequired for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal Reasoning Stress-test Environment), video benchmark composed of 500 fully scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning categories.
