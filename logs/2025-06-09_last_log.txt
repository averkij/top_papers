Audio-aware large language models can assess speaking styles in audio inputs, demonstrating performance comparable to human judges in evaluating synthesized speech along dimensions like emotion, volume, and pitch.  					AI-generated summary 				 Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) can understand the textual and non-textual information in the audio input. In this paper, we explore using ALLMs as an automatic judge to assess the speaking styles of speeches. We use ALLM judges to evaluate the speeches generated by SLMs on two tasks: voice style instruction following and role-playing. The speaking style we consider includes emotion, volume, speaking pace, word emphasis, pitch control, and non-verbal elements. We use four spoken language models (SLMs) to complete the two tasks and use humans and ALLMs to judge the SLMs' responses. We compare two ALLM judges, GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro, with human evaluation results and show that the agreement between Gemini and human judges is comparable to the agreement between human evaluators. These promising results show that ALLMs can be used as a judge to evaluate SLMs. Our results also reveal that current SLMs, even GPT-4o-audio, still have room for improvement in controlling the speaking style and generating natural dialogues.

В исследовании АОБЛМ использовались для оценки речей, сгенерированных разговорными языковыми моделями (РЯМ) в задачах следования инструкциям по стилю голоса и ролевой игры. Оценивались такие аспекты, как эмоции, громкость, темп речи, выделение слов, контроль высоты тона и невербальные элементы. Результаты показали, что согласованность между оценками Gemini и человеческих судей сопоставима с согласованностью между оценками разных людей.",
