I. INTRODUCTION ERCEIVING the world from both egocentric (firstperson) and exocentric (third-person) perspectives is fundamental ability in human intelligence. The mirror neuron theory [1] posits that the same neural mechanisms are activated when an individual performs an action and when they observe another performing the same action. This biological insight underscores the intrinsic connection between firstand thirdperson viewpoints, inspiring efforts to emulate this capability. By enabling machines to integrate and leverage information across these perspectives, we can advance video understanding and move closer to human-like perception. Y. He, Y. Huang, and G. Chen have equal contributions. Y. He, G. Chen, L. Lu and T. Lu are with the State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China. Y. Huang and Y. Sato are with the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. B. Pei is with Zhejiang University, Zhejiang 310027, China. J. Xu is with Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China. Fig. 1. Number of citations to egocentric-exocentric related papers from 2015 to 2024. Citation data was collected from Google Scholar. The statistics are computed based on papers and datasets discussed in Sections IV and V, all of which utilize both egocentric and exocentric perspectives. The exocentric (third-person) and egocentric (first-person) perspectives offer complementary views of human activity, akin to two sides of the same coin. The egocentric view provides an actor-centered perspective [2], capturing rich humanobject interactions and reflecting the wearers intentions and goals [3][5]. Unlike the exocentric view, egocentric videos are inherently more dynamic, featuring continuous motion and shifting backgrounds, which pose challenges such as partial visibility of the wearer [6], [7]. Still, the release of large-scale egocentric datasets [3], [4], [8], [9] has spurred substantial progress in egocentric video understanding [10][15]. In contrast, the exocentric view offers an observer-like perspective [2], providing broader context of the scene and the subjects actions. Different from egocentric videos, these videos are usually recorded from stable, fixed position, covering wide field of view and capturing detailed scene context. These videos can be easily captured using devices such as smartphones and surveillance cameras, and their widespread availability on the Internet has led to the creation of diverse large-scale datasets, for example, [16][21]. These datasets have driven significant advancements in third-person video understanding [19], [22][27]. While egocentric and exocentric perspectives have distinct characteristics, they are inherently complementary [8]. The ego-view provides details from the actors perspective, while the exo-view offers broader contextual understanding of the scene. Researchers can unlock new opportunities to advance video understanding by integrating these perspectives. This synergy has led to growing body of work exploring crossview learning, as demonstrated in Fig. 1. 2 Despite these advancements, there remains lack of surveys that summarize progress in integrating both perspectives. In video understanding, most surveys [28][31] focus on specific tasks and primarily concentrate on exocentric videos. In egocentric vision, Plizzari et al. [32] review advancements across multiple tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no survey has yet addressed the integration of both perspectives. Thus, our work fills this gap by systematically organizing and reviewing existing research into three primary directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis, and (3) joint learning frameworks for cross-view video understanding. The overall structure of this survey is illustrated in Fig. 2. Inspired by [32], we also adopt future-to-present approach. Specifically, we start by highlighting the transformative potential of integrating egocentric and exocentric perspectives [8], demonstrating how cross-view collaboration can benefit various domains (Section II). We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications (Section III). In addition to the systematic review of existing research works (Section IV), we also analyze benchmark datasets that support both perspectives (Section V), evaluate their diversity and applicability. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current approaches and propo"

EverGreenQA, a multilingual QA dataset with evergreen labels, is introduced to benchmark LLMs on temporality encoding and assess their performance through verbalized judgments and uncertainty signals.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate in question answering (QA) tasks. A key yet underexplored factor contributing to this is the temporality of questions -- whether they are evergreen (answers remain stable over time) or mutable (answers change). In this work, we introduce EverGreenQA, the first multilingual QA dataset with evergreen labels, supporting both evaluation and training. Using EverGreenQA, we benchmark 12 modern LLMs to assess whether they encode question temporality explicitly (via verbalized judgments) or implicitly (via uncertainty signals). We also train EG-E5, a lightweight multilingual classifier that achieves SoTA performance on this task. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of evergreen classification across three applications: improving self-knowledge estimation, filtering QA datasets, and explaining GPT-4o retrieval behavior.

"EverGreenQA, a multilingual QA dataset with evergreen labels, is introduced to benchmark LLMs on temporality encoding and assess their performance through verbalized judgments and uncertainty signals.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate in question answering (QA) tasks. A key yet underexplored factor contributing to this is the temporality of questions -- whether they are evergreen (answers remain stable over time) or mutable (answers change). In this work, we introduce EverGreenQA, the first multilingual QA dataset with evergreen labels, supporting both evaluation and training. Using EverGreenQA, we benchmark 12 modern LLMs to assess whether they encode question temporality explicitly (via verbalized judgments) or implicitly (via uncertainty signals). We also train EG-E5, a lightweight multilingual classifier that achieves SoTA performance on this task. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of evergreen classification across three applications: improving self-knowledge estimation, filtering QA datasets, and explaining GPT-4o retrieval behavior."

A survey reviews advancements in video understanding from both egocentric and exocentric perspectives, highlighting applications, tasks, joint learning frameworks, and limitations, with the aim of enhancing machine perception.  					AI-generated summary 				 Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric (third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years, allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications. Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis, and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally, we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives, evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions. By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner.

Prefix Grouper reduces computational overhead in GRPO by encoding shared prefixes only once, improving scalability in long-context scenarios without altering training dynamics or policy performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhances policy learning by computing gradients from relative comparisons among candidate outputs that share a common input prefix. Despite its effectiveness, GRPO introduces substantial computational overhead when processing long shared prefixes, which must be redundantly encoded for each group member. This inefficiency becomes a major scalability bottleneck in long-context learning scenarios. We propose Prefix Grouper, an efficient GRPO training algorithm that eliminates redundant prefix computation via a Shared-Prefix Forward strategy. In particular, by restructuring self-attention into two parts, our method enables the shared prefix to be encoded only once, while preserving full differentiability and compatibility with end-to-end training. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that Prefix Grouper is training-equivalent to standard GRPO: it yields identical forward outputs and backward gradients, ensuring that the optimization dynamics and final policy performance remain unchanged. Empirically, our experiments confirm that Prefix Grouper achieves consistent results while significantly reducing the computational cost of training, particularly in long-prefix scenarios. The proposed method is fully plug-and-play: it is compatible with existing GRPO-based architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into current training pipelines as a drop-in replacement, requiring no structural modifications and only minimal changes to input construction and attention computation. Prefix Grouper enables the use of larger group sizes under the same computational budget, thereby improving the scalability of GRPO to more complex tasks and larger models.

A novel two-stage pipeline using specialized pretrained models and a large language model enhances audio caption quality by integrating diverse multimodal cues and contextual information.  					AI-generated summary 				 High-quality, large-scale audio captioning is crucial for advancing audio understanding, yet current automated methods often generate captions that lack fine-grained detail and contextual accuracy, primarily due to their reliance on limited unimodal or superficial multimodal information. Drawing inspiration from human auditory perception, which adeptly integrates cross-modal cues and performs sophisticated auditory scene analysis, we introduce a novel two-stage automated pipeline. This pipeline first employs specialized pretrained models to extract diverse contextual cues (e.g., speech, music, general sounds, and visual information from associated video). A large language model (LLM) then synthesizes these rich, multimodal inputs to generate detailed and context-aware audio captions. Key contributions of this work include: (1) the proposed scalable method for fine-grained audio caption generation; (2) FusionAudio, a new large-scale dataset comprising 1.2 million such detailed captions, combined with 6 million QA pairs; and (3) enhanced audio models developed using FusionAudio, specifically a CLAP-based audio encoder with superior audio-text alignment and instruction following. This paper paves the way for more nuanced and accurate automated understanding of complex audio environments. Code and data can be found in https://github.com/satsuki2486441738/FusionAudio.
