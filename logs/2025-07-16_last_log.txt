Text:"Can Multimodal Foundation Models Understand Schematic Diagrams? An Empirical Study on Information-Seeking QA over Scientific Papers Yilun Zhao Chengye Wang Chuhan Li Arman Cohan5 2 0 2 4 1 ] . [ 1 7 8 7 0 1 . 7 0 5 2 : r aThis paper introduces MISS-QA, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the ability of models to interpret schematic diagrams within scientific literature. MISS-QA comprises 1,500 expert-annotated examples over 465 scientific papers. In this benchmark, models are tasked with interpreting schematic diagrams that illustrate research overviews and answering corresponding information-seeking questions based on the broader context of the paper. We assess the performance of 18 frontier multimodal foundation models, including o4mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL. We reveal significant performance gap between these models and human experts on MISS-QA. Our analysis of model performance on unanswerable questions and our detailed error analysis further highlight the strengths and limitations of current models, offering key insights to enhance models in comprehending multimodal scientific literature. Data Code yale-nlp/MISS-QA yilunzhao/MISS-QAWhen engaging with academic literature, readers frequently first consult schematic diagrams that illustrate the research framework to quickly grasp the underlying research and identify specific areas of interest. This initial visual reference is crucial as it provides an overview of the studys structure and aims, prompting readers to delve deeper into the paper content for more comprehensive understanding. Given the complexity and high volume of information in scientific papers (Dasigi et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2024a; Ajith et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2025b; Xu et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025), there is significant demand for AI Equal Contributions. Correspondence: Yilun Zhao (yilun.zhao@yale.edu) Figure 1: An overview of the MISS-QA benchmark and research questions investigated in this study. systems that can assist scientists in seeking information from paper through schematic diagrams. Foundation models have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tackling various complex tasks (Touvron et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2024; Zhao et al., 2025a). However, their capabilities in interpreting schematic diagrams and synthesizing information from related paper context remain largely underexplored. Previous scientific document QA benchmarks primarily focus on text-only contexts (Dasigi et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2023b), emphasizing information-seeking questions derived from paper abstracts. While recent scientific multimodal QA benchmarks have incorporated multimodal information from scientific papers (Li et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024c,d), their focus is largely limited to analyzing charts or tables that present experimenDataset Input Context Annotation / DatSingle Creation Scientific Figure Understanding ArXivQA (Li et al., 2024b) MMSci (Li et al., 2024d) CharXiv (Wang et al., 2024b) Single scientific chart for experiment results Single scientific chart for experiment results Single scientific chart for experiment results Rewritten from caption by GPT-4V Rewritten from caption by experts Annotated by human experts Scientific Paper QA QASPER (Dasigi et al., 2021) QASA (Lee et al., 2023a) M3SciQA (Li et al., 2024a) Single text-only scientific paper Single text-only scientific paper Multiple scientific papers with charts Annotated by human experts Annotated by human experts Synthesized by GPT-4V MISS-QA (ours) Single schematic diagram and corresponding paper Annotated by human experts Table 1: Comparisons between MISS-QA and existing scientific figure understanding and paper QA benchmarks. tal results. In contrast, reasoning over schematic diagrams introduces unique challenges. It requires understanding not only the visual elements but also their relationships, contextual meaning, and integration with the textual narrative of the paper. Addressing these challenges is critical for advancing AI systems to effectively navigate the multimodal nature of scientific research. To bridge this gap, we introduce MISS-QA, question answering benchmark focuses on Multimodal Information-Seeking over Scientific papers. The benchmark comprises 1,500 expertannotated QA examples over 465 scientific papers, capturing wide range of real-world informationseeking scenarios over scientific literature. For each question, the schematic diagramtypically appearing as the first or second figure in the paper and providing an overview of the researchserves as the focal point. Foundation models are tasked with identifying the highlighted visual element within the diagram and answering the question using the content of the paper. To mirror real-world information-seeking scenarios, where researchers often encounter questions that cannot be answered using the available context, 26.5% of the questions in MISS-QA are intentionally designed to be unanswerable (Asai and Choi, 2021; Sulem et al., 2022). Such questions tests the models ability to discern the limits of the provided information, which is crucial for scientific research. Figure 1 illustrates the key research questions investigated in this study. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We present MISS-QA, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the ability of foundation models to comprehend schematic diagrams in scientific literature. We perform comprehensive evaluation of 18 frontier multimodal foundation models, uncovering significant performance disparity between human experts and current models. We analyze model performance on unanswerable questions and conduct an in-depth error analysis, highlighting key strengths, limitations, and opportunities to improve model performance.Early document QA benchmarks (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Bajaj et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018) target short documents (e.g., Wikipedia pages) and singlehop reasoning. In contrast, question answering over scientific papers introduces unique challenges. These include interpreting domain-specific terminology, synthesizing information across multiple sections, and reasoning over multimodal content. However, as shown in Table 1, existing benchmarks in this area mainly investigate the text-only scenarios. Specifically, QASPER (Dasigi et al., 2021) focuses on tasks where questions are derived from the abstract of scientific paper, with answers found within i"

Text:"LLMalMorph: On The Feasibility of Generating Variant Malware using Large-Language-Models Md Ajwad Akil, Adrian Shuai Li, Imtiaz Karim, Arun Iyengar, Ashish Kundu, Vinny Parla, Elisa Bertino Purdue University, Cisco Research, Cisco Systems, Inc {makil, li3944, karim7, bertino}@purdue.edu, aki@akiyengar.com, ashkundu@cisco.com, vparla@cisco.com 5 2 0 2 2 1 ] . [ 1 1 1 4 9 0 . 7 0 5 2 : r AbstractLarge Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software development and automated code generation. Motivated by these advancements, this paper explores the feasibility of LLMs in modifying malware source code to generate variants. We introduce LLMalMorph, semi-automated framework that leverages semantical and syntactical code comprehension by LLMs to generate new malware variants. LLMalMorph extracts functionlevel information from the malware source code and employs custom-engineered prompts coupled with strategically defined code transformations to guide the LLM in generating variants without resource-intensive fine-tuning. To evaluate LLMalMorph, we collected 10 diverse Windows malware samples of varying types, complexity and functionality and generated 618 variants. Our thorough experiments demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the detection rates of antivirus engines of these malware variants to some extent while preserving malware functionalities. In addition, despite not optimizing against any Machine Learning (ML)-based malware detectors, several variants also achieved notable attack success rates against an ML-based malware classifier. We also discuss the limitations of current LLM capabilities in generating malware variants from source code and assess where this emerging technology stands in the broader context of malware variant generation.

Our thorough experiments demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the detection rates of antivirus engines of these malware variants to some extent while preserving malware functionalities. In addition, despite not optimizing against any Machine Learning (ML)-based malware detectors, several variants also achieved notable attack success rates against an ML-based malware classifier. We also discuss the limitations of current LLM capabilities in generating malware variants from source code and assess where this emerging technology stands in the broader context of malware variant generation."
