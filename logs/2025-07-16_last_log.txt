These examples highlight the benefits of leveraging powerful world model to extract optical flow for challenging real-world scene dynamics.Extracting optical flow from videos remains core computer vision problem. Motivated by the recent success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen self-supervised video models trained only to predict future frames can be prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior attempts to read out depth or illumination from video generators required fine-tuning; that strategy is ill-suited for flow, where labeled data is scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm, which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting small tracer perturbation into next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we extend this idea to generative video models for zero-shot flow extraction. We explore several popular architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat each spatio-temporal patch independently; *Equal contribution 1 and (3) random-access decoding that can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely present in the recently introduced Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture. Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: novel test-time inference procedure that injects localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one step, and computes the KullbackLeibler divergence between perturbed and unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning, our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid Kubric (4.7% relative improvement), despite being trained on real-world videos. Our results indicate that counterfactual prompting of controllable generative video models is scalable and effective alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality optical flow.Extracting motion information (optical flow) from videos is fundamental yet open challenge in computer vision with many applications. Due to the intractable cost of obtaining ground-truth labels from real-world videos, most supervised baselines [37, 39] are trained on synthetic datasets, e.g., FlyingChairs [12], FlyingThings [27] and Sintel [6]. While invaluable for progress, these datasets cover narrow slice of motion statisticspredominantly rigid objects, limited lighting variation, and short temporal horizons. As result, they under-represent the long-tail of real-world phenomena such as non-rigid deformation, atmospheric effects, rapid camera shake and textureless regions. Self-supervised models [21, 36] that can be trained on real videos attempt to bridge this gap, but they often rely on task-specific heuristics, such as photometric consistency or smoothness which fail under complex lighting, occlusion, or long-range motion. Consequently, both supervised and self-supervised optical flow baselines struggle to generalize to challenging in-the-wild videos. Inspired by successes across vision and language where large general-purpose models outperform smaller task-specific ones, we explore large-scale video models as possible solution. Trained on massive repositories of real-world data, modern video models already demonstrate strong scene understanding [5, 29, 1, 26], suggesting an implicit grasp of optical flow [3, 38]. However, prior work extracting visual intermediates such as depth and illumination from these models still required supervised fine-tuning [33, 11]. Extending that recipe to optical flow would again depend on synthetic labels, facing the same sim-to-real domain gap. This motivates our search for zero-shot procedure that can extract accurate optical flow from off-the-shelf video models without any additional training. In fact, such procedure has been proposed in the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) framework [3]. Zero-shot optical flow is obtained by adding small tracer perturbation to the source frame and tracking how pretrained next-frame predictor propagates the tracer to the target frame (Section 3). In practice, however, because deterministic video models like CWM can only predict single future state, it encourages predictions that average over future possibilities, yielding perceptually blurry frames that wash out the injected tracer, leading to less precise motion estimates (Section 4.1). To overcome this, we implement the perturb-and-track method with generative video models, which generate crisp predictions as they sample from distribution instead of regressing to mean. This is insufficient, however, as each state-of-the-art generative video model faces its own flow extraction challenges. Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) [5] produces photorealistic frames, but its conditioning is weak and non-localized: generation is guided by single global latent inverted from the target frame, so pixel-level edits introduce noisy differences, corrupting the extracted flo"

Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm, which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture. Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning, our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.
