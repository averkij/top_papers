[ 1 6 9 3 8 0 . 7 0 5 2 : r Subject-Consistent and Pose-Diverse Text-to-Image Generation Zhanxin Gao1 Beier Zhu2 Liang Yao3 Jian Yang1 Ying Tai1 1Nanjing University, 2Nanyang Technological University 3Vipshop yingtai@nju.edu.cn July 14, Abstract Subject-consistent generation (SCG)aiming to maintain consistent subject identity across diverse scenesremains challenge for text-to-image (T2I) models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion, where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi adopts two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement (IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to transfer identity features to each target image in pose-aware manner. This promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi. While text-to-image (T2I) [28, 33, 30, 3] models excel in high-quality image generation [30, 22], they struggle to maintain subject consistency across multiple scenes. Subject-consistent generation (SCG) aims to synthesize images of the same subject across diverse contextual prompts with three key objectives: (1) ensuring subject consistency across generated instances, (2) promoting layout and pose diversity across different instances to avoid re"

INTRODUCTION The advancements in artificial intelligence have led to the development of numerous deep neural networks, particularly large language models [1][6]. Training such models requires investments in human resources, computational substantial power, and other resources, as exemplified by GPT-4, which costs around $40 million to train [7]. Thus, they can be regarded as valuable digital assets, necessitating urgent measures for ownership protection. To this end, neural network watermarking (NNW) approaches [8][12] have been proposed to protect model ownership by embedding watermarks within the neural network. Methods that require access to model parameters for watermark embedding and verification fall under white-box neural network watermarking (NNW) [13] [19], whereas those that do not require access to the model parameters belong to black-box NNW [20][26]. Both approaches have demonstrated significant progress in safeguarding model ownership [8] and hold promise for integration in practical applications [15], [27]. Given the distinct challenges Yuan Yao is with the Beijing Teleinfo Technology Company Ltd., China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, Beijing 100095, China.

(e-mail: jinsongresearch@outlook.com) Jian Jin is with the Research Institute of Industrial Internet of Things, China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, Beijing 100095, China. (e-mail: jin.jian@caict.ac.cn) Corresponding author: Jian Jin. inherent in white-box and black-box approaches, this article concentrates on white-box NNW, with black-box NNW left for future exploration. Existing white-box NNW approaches can be broadly categorized into three sub-branches: (i) Weight-based methods [13], [14], [18], [28], [29] embed watermarks into model parameters; (ii) Passport-based methods [15][17], [27] introduce passport layers to replace normalization layers for watermark embedding; and (iii) Activation-based methods [30][32] incorporate watermarks into the activation maps of intermediate layers. Among those methods, weight-based methods are appealing due to their inherent simplicity and practicality. By embedding watermarks into the models weights, those methods offer straightforward process that can be seamlessly integrated into various network architectures without altering the original structure. This feature renders them valuable for various practical applications. Although several state-of-theart weight-based methods [14], [18], [28], [29] can effectively resist fine-tuning and pruning attacks, they remain partially vulnerable to forging, overwriting, or both types of attacks. On one hand, forging attacks attempt to fabricate counterfeit watermarks and infer the corresponding secret key through reverse engineering, by freezing the model parameters. In this scenario, the adversary could claim the models ownership, resulting in ownership ambiguity. On the other hand, overwriting attacks aim to remove the original watermark by embedding counterfeit one. In particular, adversaries can adaptively increase the embedding strength of their watermarks without being required to match the original watermarks embedding strength. In such cases, the original watermark may be removed while the adversarys watermark is embedded, leading to the invalidation of the models ownership. This raises question: How can we design more robust and effective weighted-based method that defends against both forging and overwriting attacks? To address this challenge, we propose NeuralMark, robust weighted-based method centered on hashed watermark filter. Specifically, we use hash function to generate an irreversible binary watermark from secret key, which is then employed as filter to select the model parameters for embedding. The avalanche effect of the hash function [33] ensures that even slight changes in the input lead to significant, unpredictable variations in the output, effectively impeding gradient calculation and making reverse engineering infeasible. Moreover, because the hashed watermarks generated by the model owner and the adversary are distinct, using them as private filters reduces the overlap in selected parameters, especially when the filtering process is performed repeatedly. This mechanism significantly increases the difficulty for adversaries to identify thereby protecting and manipulate the filtered parameters, the hashed watermark the original watermark. Therefore, filter cleverly intertwines the embedding parameters with the hashed watermark, providing robust defense against both forging and overwriting attacks. Furthermore, we also apply an average pooling mechanism to the filtered parameters due to its resilience against fine-tuning and pruning atta"

The CoDi framework enhances text-to-image generation by maintaining subject consistency while ensuring pose diversity through a two-stage diffusion process involving identity transport and refinement.  					AI-generated summary 				 Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I) models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion, where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement (IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

NeuralMark enhances neural network watermarking by embedding a hashed watermark into model parameters, offering robust protection against forging, overwriting, fine-tuning, and pruning attacks.  					AI-generated summary 				 As valuable digital assets, deep neural networks necessitate robust ownership protection, positioning neural network watermarking (NNW) as a promising solution. Among various NNW approaches, weight-based methods are favored for their simplicity and practicality; however, they remain vulnerable to forging and overwriting attacks. To address those challenges, we propose NeuralMark, a robust method built around a hashed watermark filter. Specifically, we utilize a hash function to generate an irreversible binary watermark from a secret key, which is then used as a filter to select the model parameters for embedding. This design cleverly intertwines the embedding parameters with the hashed watermark, providing a robust defense against both forging and overwriting attacks. An average pooling is also incorporated to resist fine-tuning and pruning attacks. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into various neural network architectures, ensuring broad applicability. Theoretically, we analyze its security boundary. Empirically, we verify its effectiveness and robustness across 13 distinct Convolutional and Transformer architectures, covering five image classification tasks and one text generation task.
