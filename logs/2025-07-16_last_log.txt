Text:"5 2 0 2 5 1 ] . [ 1 7 0 4 1 1 . 7 0 5 2 : r EXAONE 4.0: Unified Large Language Models Integrating Non-reasoning and Reasoning Modes LG AI ResearchThis technical report introduces EXAONE 4.0, which integrates NON-REASONING mode and REASONING mode to achieve both the excellent usability of EXAONE 3.5 and the advanced reasoning abilities of EXAONE Deep. To pave the way for the agentic AI era, EXAONE 4.0 incorporates essential features such as agentic tool use, and its multilingual capabilities are extended to support Spanish in addition to English and Korean. The EXAONE 4.0 model series consists of two sizes: mid-size 32B model optimized for high performance, and small-size 1.2B model designed for on-device applications. The EXAONE 4.0 demonstrates superior performance compared to open-weight models in its class and remains competitive even against frontier-class models. The models are publicly available for research purposes and can be easily downloaded via https: //huggingface.co/LGAI-EXAONE.As part of LG AI Researchs EXAONE foundation model series, the EXAONE language models have been developed to support diverse real-world applications through strong instruction-following and reasoning capabilities. The previous version, EXAONE 3.5 [31], focused on real-world usability by strengthening comprehensive instructionfollowing abilities, while EXAONE Deep [32] emphasized reasoning performance, particularly in mathematical and coding domains. With the upcoming era of agentic AI in mind, EXAONE 4.0 introduces agentic tool usea core capability for this paradigmand further advances reasoning abilities. In terms of tool use, the model is developed to enable the integration of various external tools to develop agents or applications. Regarding reasoning performance, the capabilities of EXAONE 4.0 have been improved by leveraging the validated methodologies developed in EXAONE Deep. Notably, EXAONE 4.0 unifies both NON-REASONING modeenabling rapid thinking and responsesand REASONING modedesigned for deep thinking and more accurate answersinto single model, allowing users to experience both modes within one model. Compared to previous versions of EXAONE, the number of tokens used during pretraining is significantly increased to bolster world knowledge. To further enhancement of expert knowledge, curating training data from specialized domains such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields plays important role on downstream tasks. Furthermore, the extension of maximum context length of the model to 128K tokens enables handling of various tasks based on significantly longer contexts, thereby improving usability. One notable challenge in processing long contexts is the computational burden of attention calculations. To mitigate this, hybrid architecture combining global attention and local attention is adopted. This approach minimizes performance degradation while reducing computational costs during training and inference. Moreover, the EXAONE 4.0 officially add Spanish to its supported languages, expanding beyond its previous bilingual support for English and Korean. The development of Spanish language support was designed to minimize any negative impact on English and Korean performance while maintaining the same tokenizer and vocabulary as the previous EXAONE 3.5 and Deep models. The complete list of authors who contributed to this work can be found in Appendix A. Figure 1: Visualization of the hybrid attention mechanism when the window size for local attention (sliding window attention) is set to 3. This figure illustrates how context tokens are processed across layers under the hybrid attention mechanism, highlighting the interaction between local and global attention. EXAONE 4.0 particularly excels in areas focused on world knowledge and reasoning, especially in mathematical and coding domains. Despite integrating NON-REASONING mode and REASONING mode, it secures competitive performance in instruction following. The model also shows commendable performance in long context tasks, particularly excelling in document QA (Question Answering) and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) tasks frequently used by real users. Regarding tool use, it achieves level comparable to competing models, marking the beginning of the fundamental capabilities essential for the upcoming agentic AI era. Additionally, our supported languages now include English, Korean, and the newly supported Spanish. The EXAONE 4.0 model demonstrates competitive performance in both Korean and Spanish across diverse range of tasks, including expert-level knowledge and mathematical reasoning.2.1 Model Configurations The EXAONE 4.0 model retains similar structural framework to the EXAONE 3.5 model, but incorporates several key differences in its architecture. Notably, we modify the approach to the attention mechanism. In the previous EXAONE 3.5 model, every layer utilized global attention, whereas the EXAONE 4.0 model employs hybrid attention mechanism that combines local attention (sliding window attention type) with global attention in 3:1 ratio, as illustrated in Figure 1. Contrary to past findings that models using global attention across all layers performed better, recent studies [14, 15, 36] suggested that utilizing larger window size (e.g., from 512 to 1,024 or 4,096) and applying global attention to only minority of layers can still achieve excellent long-context performance. Additionally, it reported that incorporating small amounts of global attention periodically in combinations with heterogeneous structures like Mamba [34, 39, 43] helped maintain the ability to understand global context. In designing the EXAONE 4.0 model, sliding window size of 4K is selected to minimize any adverse effects on shortcontext performance. Furthermore, the model does not employ Rotary Position embedding [63] for global attention, ensuring that the model does not develop biases towards length and can maintain global view. For the design of the local attention mechanism, we do not employ the chunked attention strategy. Instead, we adopt sliding window attention, well-established form of sparse attention that offers strong theoretical stability. Unlike chunked attention, sliding window attention benefits from wide support in open-source frameworks, ensuring robust implementation and ease of integration. To prevent performance degradation in short-context areas during long context fine-tuning, the EXAONE 4.0 model employ"

AgentsNet is a new benchmark for evaluating multi-agent systems' ability to self-organize, communicate, and solve problems collaboratively across varying network sizes.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large-language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful problem-solving capabilities, in particular when organized in multi-agent systems. However, the advent of such systems also raises several questions on the ability of a complex network of agents to effectively self-organize and collaborate. While measuring performance on standard reasoning benchmarks indicates how well multi-agent systems can solve reasoning tasks, it is unclear whether these systems are able to leverage their topology effectively. Here, we propose AgentsNet, a new benchmark for multi-agent reasoning. By drawing inspiration from classical problems in distributed systems and graph theory, AgentsNet measures the ability of multi-agent systems to collaboratively form strategies for problem-solving, self-organization, and effective communication given a network topology. We evaluate a variety of baseline methods on AgentsNet including homogeneous networks of agents which first have to agree on basic protocols for organization and communication. We find that some frontier LLMs are already demonstrating strong performance for small networks but begin to fall off once the size of the network scales. While existing multi-agent benchmarks cover at most 2-5 agents, AgentsNet is practically unlimited in size and can scale with new generations of LLMs. As such, we also probe frontier models in a setup with up to 100 agents.
