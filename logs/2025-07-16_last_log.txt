Research identifies pretraining as the primary source of cognitive biases in large language models, distinguishing its influence from finetuning and training randomness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans. Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over 30 cognitive biases. Second, we introduce cross-tuning -- swapping instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

  "desc": "Исследование показывает, что когнитивные искажения в больших языковых моделях (LLM) в основном формируются на этапе предварительного обучения, а не во время тонкой настройки или из-за случайности в процессе обучения. Учёные использовали метод кросс-настройки, меняя наборы данных для инструкций между моделями, чтобы выделить источники искажений. Результаты демонстрируют, что модели с одинаковой предварительно обученной основой имеют более схожие паттерны искажений, чем модели, разделяющие только данные для тонкой настройки. Это понимание может помочь в разработке стратегий оценки и снижения искажений в LLM.",
