Pan 1 Zhangyang Wang 1 Jinwon Lee 2 ABSTRACT Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but are notoriously memory-intensive during training, particularly with the popular AdamW optimizer. This memory burden often necessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting training scalability and throughput, respectively. To address this, various memory-efficient optimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they face key challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations (e.g., GaLore, Fira); (ii) significant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW (e.g., Flora); and (iii) still substantial memory overhead of optimization states in order to maintain competitive performance (e.g., 1/4 rank in GaLore, and full-rank first momentum in Adam-mini). In this work, we investigate the redundancy in AdamWs learning rate adaption rule and identify that it can be coarsened as structured learning rate update (channel-wise or tensor-wise). Based on this insight, we propose novel approach, Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory Efficient LLM Optimization (APOLLO), which approximate the channel-wise learning rate scaling with an auxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. The structured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further memory reduction with lower rank, halving the rank while delivering similar pre-training performance. We further propose an extreme memory-efficient version, APOLLO-Mini, which utilizes tensor-wise scaling with only rank-1 auxiliary sub-space, achieving SGD-level memory cost but superior pre-training performance than Adam(W). We conduct extensive experiments across different model architectures and tasks, showing that APOLLO series performs generally o"

Open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in a broad range of multimodal tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities remain constrained by existing instruction-tuning datasets, which were predominately repurposed from academic datasets such as VQA, AI2D, and ChartQA. These datasets target simplistic tasks, and only provide phrase-level answers without any intermediate rationales. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable and cost-effective method to construct a large-scale multimodal instruction-tuning dataset with rich intermediate rationales designed to elicit CoT reasoning. Using only open models, we create a dataset containing 12M instruction-response pairs to cover diverse, reasoning-intensive tasks with detailed and faithful rationales. Experiments demonstrate that training MLLMs on this dataset significantly improves reasoning capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as MathVerse (+8.1%), MMMU-Pro (+7%), and MuirBench (+13.3%). Additionally, the model demonstrates notable improvements of up to 4% on non-reasoning-based benchmarks. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of key components, such as rewriting and self-filtering, in the dataset construction process.

Large language models (LLMs) are notoriously memory-intensive during training, particularly with the popular AdamW optimizer. This memory burden necessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting training scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient optimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they face critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii) significant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still substantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.   In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be effectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this insight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM Optimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an auxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This structured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further memory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even its rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance compared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.   Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with or better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly eliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant system-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB setup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model Scalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without system-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training LLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight quantization.
