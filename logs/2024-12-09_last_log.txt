Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.

Text-to-video generation models have shown significant progress in the recent years. However, they still struggle with generating complex dynamic scenes based on compositional text prompts, such as attribute binding for multiple objects, temporal dynamics associated with different objects, and interactions between objects. Our key motivation is that complex tasks can be decomposed into simpler ones, each handled by a role-specialized MLLM agent. Multiple agents can collaborate together to achieve collective intelligence for complex goals. We propose GenMAC, an iterative, multi-agent framework that enables compositional text-to-video generation. The collaborative workflow includes three stages: Design, Generation, and Redesign, with an iterative loop between the Generation and Redesign stages to progressively verify and refine the generated videos. The Redesign stage is the most challenging stage that aims to verify the generated videos, suggest corrections, and redesign the text prompts, frame-wise layouts, and guidance scales for the next iteration of generation. To avoid hallucination of a single MLLM agent, we decompose this stage to four sequentially-executed MLLM-based agents: verification agent, suggestion agent, correction agent, and output structuring agent. Furthermore, to tackle diverse scenarios of compositional text-to-video generation, we design a self-routing mechanism to adaptively select the proper correction agent from a collection of correction agents each specialized for one scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GenMAC, achieving state-of-the art performance in compositional text-to-video generation.

The framework also includes a self-routing mechanism to select the most suitable correction agent for various scenarios, leading to significant advancements in generating dynamic scenes from text prompts.', title='Collaborative Intelligence for Text-to-Video Mastery'))

Recent advances in text-guided image editing enable users to perform image edits through simple text inputs, leveraging the extensive priors of multi-step diffusion-based text-to-image models. However, these methods often fall short of the speed demands required for real-world and on-device applications due to the costly multi-step inversion and sampling process involved. In response to this, we introduce SwiftEdit, a simple yet highly efficient editing tool that achieve instant text-guided image editing (in 0.23s). The advancement of SwiftEdit lies in its two novel contributions: a one-step inversion framework that enables one-step image reconstruction via inversion and a mask-guided editing technique with our proposed attention rescaling mechanism to perform localized image editing. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SwiftEdit. In particular, SwiftEdit enables instant text-guided image editing, which is extremely faster than previous multi-step methods (at least 50 times faster) while maintain a competitive performance in editing results.
