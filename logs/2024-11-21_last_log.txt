To this end, we present VBench, comprehensive benchmark suite that dissects video generation quality into specific, hierarchical, and disentangled dimensions, each with tailored prompts and evaluation methods. VBench has several appealing properties: 1) Comprehensive Dimensions: VBench comprises 16 dimensions in video generation (e.g., subject identity inconsistency, motion smoothness, temporal flickering, and spatial relationship, etc). The evaluation metrics with fine-grained levels reveal individual models strengths and weaknesses. 2) Human Alignment: We also provide dataset of human preference annotations to validate our benchmarks alignment with human perception, for each evaluation dimension respectively. 3) Valuable Insights: We look into current models ability across various evaluation dimensions, and various content types. We also investigate the gaps between video and image generation models. 4) Versatile Benchmarking: VBench++ is designed to evaluate wide range of video generation tasks, including text-to-video and image-to-video. We introduce high-quality Image Suite with an adaptive aspect ratio to enable fair evaluations across different image-to-video generation settings. Beyond"
