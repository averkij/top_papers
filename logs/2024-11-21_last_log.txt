Text:"Stylecodes: Encoding Stylistic Information For Image Generation Corresponding author: crowles98@gmail.com 4 2 0 2 9 1 ] . [ 1 1 1 8 2 1 . 1 1 4 2 : r Fig. 1: Our Style Encoder compresses image styles into compact strings for styleconditioned generation. Abstract. Diffusion models excel in image generation, but controlling them remains challenge. We focus on the problem of style-conditioned image generation. Although example images work, they are cumbersome: srefs (style-reference codes) from MidJourney solve this issue by expressing specific image style in short numeric code. These have seen widespread adoption throughout social media due to both their ease of sharing and the fact they allow using an image for style control, without having to post the source images themselves. However, users are not able to generate srefs from their own images, nor is the underlying training procedure public. We propose StyleCodes: an open-source and open-research style encoder architecture and training procedure to express image style as 20-symbol base64 code. Our experiments show that our encoding results in minimal loss in quality compared to traditional image-to-style techniques. Keywords: Image Generation, Diffusion Models, Image Conditioning 2 1 C. Rowles The field of image generation has received fresh impetus from diffusion model theory, where it is seen as an iterative process that reverses the diffusion of images into pure noise. Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks and have proven to be more robust to train than the previous GAN-based models. They are also more widely applicable in practice, in large part because of the classifier-free guidance technique, which offers unprecedented control over the output image using text prompt [7]. However, the common proverb An image is worth thousand words is as relevant as ever: crafting text prompts that result in exactly the desired image is non-trivial task, referred to as prompt en"
