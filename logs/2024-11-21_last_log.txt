Extending context window sizes allows large language models (LLMs) to process longer sequences and handle more complex tasks. Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) has become the de facto standard due to its relative positional encoding properties that benefit long-context training. However, we observe that using RoPE with BFloat16 format results in numerical issues, causing it to deviate from its intended relative positional encoding, especially in long-context scenarios. This issue arises from BFloat16's limited precision and accumulates as context length increases, with the first token contributing significantly to this problem. To address this, we develop AnchorAttention, a plug-and-play attention method that alleviates numerical issues caused by BFloat16, improves long-context capabilities, and speeds up training. AnchorAttention reduces unnecessary attention computations, maintains semantic coherence, and boosts computational efficiency by treating the first token as a shared anchor with a consistent position ID, making it visible to all documents within the training context. Experiments on three types of LLMs demonstrate that AnchorAttention significantly improves long-context performance and reduces training time by over 50\% compared to standard full attention mechanisms, while preserving the original LLM's capabilities on general tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/haonan3/AnchorContext.

Авторы обнаружили численные проблемы при использовании Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) с форматом BFloat16, особенно в сценариях с длинным контекстом. AnchorAttention решает эту проблему, рассматривая первый токен как общий якорь с постоянным идентификатором позиции. Эксперименты показали, что AnchorAttention значительно улучшает производительность при работе с длинными контекстами и сокращает время обучения более чем на 50% по сравнению со стандартными механизмами полного внимания.",
