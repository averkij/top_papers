Text:"Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for Tunable Metalens Photography5 2 0 2 8 2 ] . [ 1 3 5 7 2 2 . 6 0 5 2 : r Figure 1. metasurface-based ultra-compact camera system empowered by large-model-driven image restoration algorithm. Compared to state-of-the-art image restoration methods, our approach achieves superior reconstruction quality and enhanced visual perception.1. Introduction Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational imaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational restoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical calibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world imaging systems. Furthermore, lack of control over the inference process often results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce DegradationModeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography, leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside pseudo data augmentation. tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity and perceptual quality. Additionally, spatially varying degradation-aware attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced degradation. Finally, we design and build millimeter-scale MetaCamera for real-world validation. Extensive results show that our approach outperforms stateof-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image reconstruction. More materials: https://dmdiff.github.io/. The demand for compact, high-performance imaging systems has grown rapidly with advancements in biomedical imaging, implantable vision systems, point-of-care diagnostics, and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) [29, 31, 43, 60]. However, conventional compound lens systems rely on multi-element optics to correct aberrations, making it challenging to achieve both miniaturization and high imaging quality. Metalenses, class of engineered optical interfaces composed of subwavelength-scale nanostructures, enable precise optical wavefront control by manipulating phase, amplitude, and polarization within an ultrathin form factor. Combined with computational restoration methods, their unique capabilities offer new opportunities for developing compact, high-performance imaging systems. [16, 23, 29, 31, 43, 60]. While metalenses present promising solution for ultracompact imaging systems, their practical implementation is constrained by optical limitations and computational complexities. Specifically, images captured by metalenses suffer from spatially varying degradations due to aberrations. Conventional model-based restoration techniques, such as Wiener filtering [55] and iterative deconvolution methods [8, 25, 58], typically assume uniform distortions and struggle to correct the highly localized aberrations caused by the metalens. Although dividing images into small patches can mitigate this issue, it leads to reduced robustness and stability in the algorithms. Deep learning-based approaches [1, 33, 51, 61] have demonstrated more significant potential for restoration, offering powerful capabilities. However, these approaches typically require large datasets of pixelaligned image pairs for training, which are often difficult to obtain for computational imaging systems. As result, recent research has shifted toward employing large-scale models pretrained on extensive datasets as priors for image super-resolution and restoration tasks, leading to significant improvements in robustness, generalization, and overall performance. Among the various techniques, generative diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance [2, 18, 27, 40, 56]. These models, pretrained on vast collections of image and text data, possess powerful natural image priors that allow them to synthesize vivid and authentic details more effectively than conventional GANbased methods [15]. However, despite their impressive capabilities, DMs are not devoid of limitations. Their restoration process is inherently prone to generating hallucinated details that do not exist in the original image, due to the lack of fine-grained control over the restoration process during inference. In this manuscript, we propose degradation-modeled multipath diffusion model for tunable metalens photography, leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of large datasets. We first introduce the spatially varying degradation-aware attention (SVDA) module, which quantifies degradation by analyzing both the optical point spread function (PSF) of the metalens and the quality of image patches. This allows it to effectively account for degradation from both the metalens and image sensors. The degradation characterization results are further employed by the attention network to guide the LoRA finetuning process, enabling the diffusion model to adaptively handle region-specific degradations. We then propose the multipath diffusion model comprising three distinct pathways: positive-prompt path for generating high-frequency details, neutral-prompt path for restoring structural fidelity, and negative-prompt path for mitigating metalensspecific degradation. The negative-prompt path also facilitates the generation of pseudo input-output paired samples, which expand the training dataset and enhance generalization. To enable smooth control over the reconstruction results, we introduce tunable decoder that adaptively merges the latent codes from the positive and neutral paths, allowing users to adjust the balance between reconstruction fidelity and perceptual quality. Finally, as demonstrated in Fig. 1, we design and build micro metalens-based camera (MetaCamera) to validate our algorithm. MetaCamera achieves size of approximately 1 mm3. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm successfully reconstructs images with both high fidelity and sharpness, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. Collectively, the contributions of this manuscript are as follows: Multipath Diffusion Model. We propose multipath diffusion model incorporating positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths to balance high-frequency details and structural fidelity while mitigating metalens-specific degradation. Additionally, we introduce an instantly tunable decoder that e"
