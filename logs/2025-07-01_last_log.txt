Text:"VOCABTRIM: Vocabulary Pruning for Efficient Speculative Decoding in LLMs Raghavv Goel 1 Sudhanshu Agrawal 1 Mukul Gagrani 1 Junyoung Park 1 Yifan Zao 1 He Zhang 1 Tian Liu 1 Yiping Yang 1 Xin Yuan 1 Jiuyan Lu 1 Chris Lott 1 Mingu Lee 1 5 2 0 2 8 2 ] . [ 1 4 9 6 2 2 . 6 0 5 2 : r aIn this paper, we introduce simple training-free technique to improve the performance of drafterbased speculative decoding (SpD) methods that incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample draft sequence or tree consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by base LLM, target model, accepting subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered that the speculative decoding requires one-toone mapping between vocabularies of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose simple technique, VOCABTRIM, to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in memory-bound environment. VOCABTRIM reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain only limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting latency in memorybound process which is often the case on edge devices, resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically by 16% for Llama3.2-3B-Instruct. 1Qualcomm AI Research. is an initiative of Qualcomm Technologies, respondence to: goel/mingul@qti.qualcomm.com>. Qualcomm AI Research CorRaghavv Goel, Mingu Lee <raghInc.. Figure 1: xLAM (function-calling) dataset token freqeuncy based on target model generation. Plots divided into three parts for ease of readability. 1. Introduction Speculative Decoding (SpD) (Leviathan et al., 2023) is widely adopted inference optimization technique for large language models (LLMs). In SpD, lightweight drafter speculates the tokens that larger target model would generate. The target model then selectively accepts or rejects these speculations based on policy that often ensures that the output follows the same distribution as the target model. Prior work on SpD has focused primarily on balancing the expressiveness and efficiency of the drafter, either by designing novel model architectures (Li et al., 2024a; Cai et al., 2024; Zimmer et al., 2024) or by developing drafttime search algorithms (Miao et al., 2023; Jeon et al., 2024). However, these approaches typically require training separate drafter, with the shared tokenizer, when well-aligned pretrained model is not available (Goel et al., 2024). While recent advances have proposed increasingly effective drafters, we observe that their predictions tend to focus on easy-to-predict tokens such as articles, prepositions, or completions of partially generated words. For example, drafter may suggest table immediately after the target model generates vege, thereby completing the word vegetable (Gagrani et al., 2024). This behavior suggests that the role of the drafter could be shifted from generalpurpose generator to more specialized token suggester, particularly by restricting its vocabulary. We further observe that in many downstream tasks, the target model generation is limited on small portion of its full vocabulary. As shown in Figure 1, we analyze the output token distribution of Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on the training split of function calling dataset (Liu et al., 2024). Only 1 Accepted at IMCL 2025 Workshop on Efficient Systems for Foundational Models small set of tokens occur at very high frequencies. For instance, 15 tokens are sampled more than 10K times and the next 140 tokens appear between 1K and 10K times. In contrast, more than 120,000 tokens are rarely or not sampled at all. This observation suggests an opportunity to simplify the output token space of the drafter. If the drafter only needs to predict limited set of frequently sampled tokens, computing logits over the full vocabulary may be unnecessary, i.e., saving memory and computation for drafting. The saving becomes more significant when the target model is with large vocabulary size, which is common in modern LLMs for improved support for multiple language and token efficiency, i.e., compression rate. (Dubey et al., 2024) The language modeling (LM) head, which maps hidden representations to vocabulary logits through linear projection, is often major contributor to both model size and inference latency. This issue is particularly pronounced in small drafters with large vocabularies. For example, in 314M-parameter drafter using the Llama 3 vocabulary (128K tokens), the LM head alone accounts for over 30% of the total parameters. This significantly limits the speedup potential of SpD, given that generation is typically memory-bound process. Motivated by these observations, we propose VOCABTRIM, training-free method for improving the efficiency of speculative decoding by reducing the size of the LM head of the drafter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that directly addresses the LM head, which has been largely overlooked in previous SpD research. By restricting the output dimension of the LM head, VOCABTRIM provides significant memory and latency savings without requiring any training or architectural changes. For Llama 3 models, we show that VOCABTRIM can reduce the output dimension of the LM heads by up to 75% with negligible impact to the acceptance rates. When applied to the state-ofthe-art SpD method EAGLE-2, our method achieves on average 16% latency improvement on Spec-Bench tasks (Xia et al., 2024). We hope that this work encourages further research into optimizing previously underexplored components of the SpD pipeline. 2. Related Work Speculative decoding was introduced in (Leviathan et al., 2023), which showed using two language models: smaller drafter model, and the larger target model, in memory bound setting can help accelerate LLM token generation. key contribution of this work was the gen"

Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter model, combines multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1 incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves 4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

"Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter model, combines multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1 incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves 4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing."

UrbanLLaVA, a multi-modal large language model, effectively processes urban datasets for various tasks, outperforming existing models in both single-modal and complex cross-modal scenarios.  					AI-generated summary 				 Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we introduce UrbanLLaVA, a multi-modal large language model designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In UrbanLLaVA, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and downstream performance of UrbanLLaVA across diverse urban tasks. Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results from three cities demonstrate that UrbanLLaVA outperforms open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

A technique called VocabTrim improves drafter-based speculative decoding by reducing the vocabulary of the drafter language model, thus decreasing drafting latency in memory-bound environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim, to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices, resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

As it is usually considered that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim, to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices, resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct."

ThinkSound, a novel framework, uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning with a multimodal large language model to generate high-quality audio from videos, achieving state-of-the-art results in various benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present ThinkSound, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages: foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes, interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce AudioCoT, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio benchmark.
