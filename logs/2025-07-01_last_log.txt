[ 1 0 0 5 6 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r aFine-tuning LLMs is both computationally and memory-intensive. While parameter-efficient finetuning methods, such as QLoRA and DoRA, reduce the number of trainable parameters and lower memory usage, they do not decrease computational cost. In some cases, they may even slow down fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce SparseLoRA, method that accelerates LLM finetuning through contextual sparsity. We propose lightweight, training-free SVD sparsity estimator that dynamically selects sparse subset of weights for loss and gradient computation. Also, we systematically analyze and address sensitivity across layers, tokens, and training steps. Our experimental results show that SparseLoRA reduces computational cost by up to 2.2 and measured speedup of up to 1.6 while maintaining accuracy across various downstream tasks, including commonsense and arithmetic reasoning, code generation, and instruction following. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast, generaldomain datasets. They are often fine-tuned to improve their performance in specific domains (Saab et al., 2024) or to align their predictions with user preferences (Zhang et al., 2024a). However, fine-tuning very large models can be prohibitively expensive, both in terms of memory requirements and computational costs. Extensive efforts have been made in parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) to reduce memory consumption of LLM finetuning. LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) represents weight updates using low-rank approximations. Building upon this, many *Equal contribution Project lead 1University of Toronto 2UC Berkeley 3MIT 4Google DeepMind.

Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 Figure 1: Many recent parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as QLoRA and DoRA, do not reduce compute. Our SparseLoRA accelerates LLM fine-tuning with minimal accuracy loss across range of downstream tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, code generation, and instruction following. See Section 4 for more details. follow-up methods (Dettmers et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b) have been proposed to further reduce the number of trainable parameters. While they are effective in reducing memory usage, they do not reduce computation. In fact, they can sometimes slow down fine-tuning due to the overhead they introduce: DoRA is 20% slower than LoRA (see Figure 1). In this paper, we present SparseLoRA to accelerate LLM fine-tuning with contextual sparsity, making it both memoryand computation-efficient. Contextual sparsity has already been used in accelerating LLM inference (Liu et al., 2023b). SparseLoRA shows for the first time that it can also play role in LLM fine-tuning, where (1) only sparse subset of weights is required for loss and gradient computation, and (2) this sparse subset needs to be determined based on the input sequence or tokens. To realize this, we propose SparseLoRA: Accelerating LLM Fine-Tuning with Contextual Sparsity cessitating alternative methods to reintroduce and exploit sparsity. Recent work has explored various techniques, including continued pretraining (Song et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2024c; Song et al., 2024a;b; Xue et al., 2024) and magnitude pruning with specific metrics (Lee et al., 2024; Akhauri et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a), to leverage sparsity in LLMs. These approaches aim to reduce memory usage and computation time, with some work deploying small neural networks to predict non-zero activations (Liu et al., 2023b; Alizadeh et al., 2024; Akhauri et al., 2024; Song et al., 2023; Xue et al., 2024). In this work, we propose novel approach to extend the benefits of contextual sparsity to the fine-tuning process for the first time, which addresses the associated challenges and accelerates finetuning without compromising performance. Memory-Efficient Fine-tuning. As language models grow larger, memory-efficient fine-tuning methods have become crucial. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques address this challenge by updating only small subset of parameters. LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) employs lowrank matrices to adjust pretrained model weights, sparking rich line of research with numerous works proposing improvements and variations (Dettmers et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Kopiczko et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b; Meng et al., 2024; Hayou et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Wang & Liang, 2024; Liu et al., 2024c; Pan et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024). Among these, DoRA (Liu et al., 2024b) reparameterizes weight matrices to achieve more effective optimization. QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023) combines quantization with low-rank adapters, enabling fine-tuning of large models on single GPU. Recent research has also focused on exploiting the lowrank structure of weight gradients. GaLore (Zhao et al., 2024) and its weight-quantized variant (Zhang et al., 2024b) leverage this property to reduce optimizer state memory, while WeLore (Jaiswal et al., 2024) investigates how lowrank weights emerge from low-rank gradients during training. While these advancements make LLM adaptation more memory-efficient and accessible, they primarily focus on reducing memory usage, sometimes even at the cost of increased computation time. Our approach addresses this missing piece by focusing on compute efficiency, complementing existing memory-efficient techniques to enable truly resource-efficient fine-tuning. Computation-Efficient Training. Prior work has explored sparsity to accelerate LLM training through various approaches (Thangarasa et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Mozaffari et al., 2024). LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2024) enables efficient context window extension via shifted sparse attention during fine-tuning while retaining stanFigure 2: Runtime breakdown of LLaMA3-8B fine-tuning under different sequence lengths. using an SVD sparsity estimator to identify which channels should be activated based on samples within each batch.

Unlike previous methods that only reduce the number of trainable parameters, SparseLoRA significantly cuts down on computational costs and speeds up the fine-tuning process. It employs a lightweight, training-free singular value decomposition (SVD) estimator to dynamically select which weights to use, ensuring optimal performance across different layers and training steps.
