Text:"SPIRAL: Self-Play on Zero-Sum Games Incentivizes Reasoning via Multi-Agent Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning Bo Liu*1, Leon Guertler*2, Simon Yu*3, Zichen Liu*1,4 Penghui Qi1,4, Daniel Balcells5, Mickel Liu6, Cheston Tan2, Weiyan Shi3, Min Lin4, Wee Sun Lee1, 6 Natasha Jaques 1National University of Singapore 2Centre for Frontier AI Research (CFAR), A*STAR 3Northeastern University 4Sea AI Lab 5Plastic Labs 6University of Washington Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, self-play framework where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision. Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To enable this self-play training at scale, We implement fully online, multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training. Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6% improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000 expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation, and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to strong reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These results demonstrate that zero-sum games"

Text:"Evolving Prompts In-Context: An Open-ended, Self-replicating Perspective Jianyu Wang 1 2 Zhiqiang Hu 1 2 Lidong Bing1. Introduction 5 2 0 2 2 2 ] . [ 1 0 3 9 7 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r We propose novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent gibberish can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the gibberish always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we propose self-discover prompt optimization framework, PROMPTQUINE, an evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent complexity in naturesuch as symbiosis and selforganizationarising in response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more effective LLM prompting.

Proceedings of the 42 nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada. PMLR 267, 2025. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 Prompting large language models (LLMs) has become the de facto standard for numerous applications, shifting the community focus to designing prompts that maximize model performance. However, this task is inherently complex due to the nuanced and often unpredictable behavior of LLMs (Lu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023). Subtle changes in phrasing, structure, or context can dramatically affect outputs (Jiang et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2023). Consequently, prompt engineering relies heavily on iterative experimentation and evaluation. On the other hand, automatic prompt optimization (Liu et al., 2023) explores to minimize the human involvement by leveraging computations to refine prompts iteratively. The conventional wisdom (Zhao et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023; Wan et al., 2024) suggests that well-specified task instruction, combined with few tuned demonstrations for ICL, yields the best results. This paper presents study that challenges conventional wisdom by showing that pruning clear, detailed demonstrations into seemingly incoherent gibberish (both syntactically and semantically strange) can, counterintuitively, improve performance across various tasks. Notably, this effect generalizes across models, regardless of alignment (Shen et al., 2023b), suggesting broader misspecification of unnatural language in current LLMs. Even more surprisingly, we find that this gibberish consistently matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art automatic prompt optimization results in several tasks. Consequently, we propose novel conceptual framework that reframes prompt compression as guided prompt search, enhancing both serving efficiency and task performance. We further explore algorithms to achieve these improvements. To derive effective pruning strategies, one might expect existing instance attribution (Li et al., 2016a; Yin & Neubig, 2022) or prompt compression methods (Li et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023c;d; Pan et al., 2024) to provide guidance. However, we find that none of these methods can reliably produce accurate token importance scores to guide the pruning, let alone human intuition according to word semantics. more practical idea is to ask algorithms to discover the pruning strategies by themselves. We thus develop selfdiscover prompt optimization framework, Genetic PromptQuine (PROMPTQUINE), an evolutionary search framework Evolving Prompts In-Context: An Open-ended, Self-replicating Perspective that automatically searches for the pruning strategy by itself using low-shot regimes. The philosophy of this framework is essentially self-replicating program (Von Neumann et al., 1966) that copies and mutates the prompt itself (e.g., pruning random tokens). The mutated prompts compete for limited resources to survive based on their fitness, with only the most performant surviving, thereby evolving effective pruning strategies over multiple generations. The entire process closely resembles the evolutionary dynamics of biological systems, where self-replication and adaptation drive the emergence of more effective strategies over successive generations (i.e., evolutionary self-replication). Evolutionary self-replication, fundamental concept in Darwinian evolution (Ofria & Wilke, 2004), explains how life reproduces and evolves through genetic variation and natural selection, fostering the emergence of unpredictable traits and behaviors that enhance adaptability to constantly shifting environmental conditions. Similarly, the prompt design problem can also be framed as an evolutionary process, where prompts shall be iteratively refined to adapt to complex LLM environments. As such, prompts that are optimal for complex LLMs may exceed human intuition and require methods beyond manual design. Inspired by our findings, we propose embracing more open-ended innovations (or broader open-endedness (Stanley et al., 2017))shifting from the human language space towards the LLM language spaceto advance LLM prompting strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our search framework through large-scale experiments across tasks and LLMs. Our results show that pruning low-shot ICL prompt could perform comparably to state-of-the-art methods on range of tasks, while maintaining competitive runtime efficiency compared to prior optimization methods (e.g., Table 10 in Appendix). Notably, our PROMPTQUINE framework is inherently well-suited for paralle"

Text:"Department of Software Technologies, Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski Email: ssemanuilo@fmi.uni-sofia.bg External tool integration through function-calling is essential for practical language model applications, yet most multilingual models lack reliable tool-use capabilities in non-English languages. Even state-ofthe-art multilingual models struggle with determining when to use tools and generating the structured outputs required for function calls, often exhibiting language confusion when prompted in lower-resource languages. This work presents methodology for adapting existing language models to enable robust tool use in any target language, using Bulgarian as case study. The approach involves continued training of the BgGPT model series (2.6B, 9B, 27B parameters) on novel bilingual dataset of 10,035 function-calling examples designed to support standardized protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). The research introduces TUCAN (Tool-Using Capable Assistant Navigator), which achieves up to 28.75% improvement in function-calling accuracy over base models while preserving core language understanding, as verified on established Bulgarian benchmarks. Beyond accuracy gains, TUCAN models demonstrate productionready response formatting with clean, parsable function calls, contrasting with the verbose and inconsistent outputs of base models. The models, evaluation framework, and dataset are released to enable replication for other languages. This work demonstrates practical approach for extending tool-augmented capabilities beyond English-centric systems. 1.

VMoBA, a novel sparse attention mechanism for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs), accelerates training and inference by addressing the quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms while maintaining or improving video generation quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration, high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality, varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and 1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for high-res video generation.

"VMoBA, a novel sparse attention mechanism for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs), accelerates training and inference by addressing the quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms while maintaining or improving video generation quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration, high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality, varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and 1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for high-res video generation."

Calligrapher uses a diffusion-based framework with self-distillation and localized style injection to generate high-quality, stylistically consistent digital typography.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Calligrapher, a novel diffusion-based framework that innovatively integrates advanced text customization with artistic typography for digital calligraphy and design applications. Addressing the challenges of precise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our framework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a self-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image generative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically construct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a localized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which comprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from reference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to directly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing the refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's accurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph positioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography, Calligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in digital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.

A novel ToF depth denoising network uses motion-invariant graph fusion and adaptive filters to improve temporal stability and spatial sharpness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Depth images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors are prone to noise, requiring denoising for reliable downstream applications. Previous works either focus on single-frame processing, or perform multi-frame processing without considering depth variations at corresponding pixels across frames, leading to undesirable temporal inconsistency and spatial ambiguity. In this paper, we propose a novel ToF depth denoising network leveraging motion-invariant graph fusion to simultaneously enhance temporal stability and spatial sharpness. Specifically, despite depth shifts across frames, graph structures exhibit temporal self-similarity, enabling cross-frame geometric attention for graph fusion. Then, by incorporating an image smoothness prior on the fused graph and data fidelity term derived from ToF noise distribution, we formulate a maximum a posterior problem for ToF denoising. Finally, the solution is unrolled into iterative filters whose weights are adaptively learned from the graph-informed geometric attention, producing a high-performance yet interpretable network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency on synthetic DVToF dataset and exhibits robust generalization on the real Kinectv2 dataset.

Inference-time techniques like decoding-time scaling and self-refinement enhance reasoning in vision-language models, with generation-based methods providing greater improvement than verification-based methods, despite RL-trained models not showing self-correction benefits.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that inference-time computation techniques, such as decoding-time scaling and self-refinement, can significantly enhance reasoning capabilities without relying on external knowledge. A key driver of this success is the emergence of self-correction and self-verification behaviors, often elicited through reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate whether these inference-time techniques extend effectively to vision-language models (VLMs), particularly those trained with RL. We find that while decoding strategies such as majority voting and best-of-N selection with self-verification all improve VLM reasoning performance, generation-reliant methods such as the former achieve significantly higher gains versus verification-reliant methods such as the latter. Additionally, the self-correction behavior often associated with RL-tuned models, such as aha moment, does not lead to measurable gains. We show via extensive experimentation within the inference-time scaling framework to identify a key root cause: RL-trained VLMs still lack robust self-verification capabilities across both visual and textual modalities.

Self-play in zero-sum games using SPIRAL enhances reasoning capabilities in language models through self-improvement and transfer learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision. Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online, multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training. Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6% improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000 expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation, and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous reasoning development.

A novel prompt design paradigm, PromptQuine, shows that pruning random demonstrations into "gibberish" can improve large language model performance across various tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent "gibberish" can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the "gibberish" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent complexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more effective LLM prompting.

A methodology is presented to adapt language models for robust tool use across languages, specifically improving function-calling accuracy in Bulgarian.  					AI-generated summary 				 External tool integration through function-calling is essential for practical language model applications, yet most multilingual models lack reliable tool-use capabilities in non-English languages. Even state-of-the-art multilingual models struggle with determining when to use tools and generating the structured outputs required for function calls, often exhibiting language confusion when prompted in lower-resource languages. This work presents a methodology for adapting existing language models to enable robust tool use in any target language, using Bulgarian as a case study. The approach involves continued training of the BgGPT model series (2.6B, 9B, 27B parameters) on a novel bilingual dataset of 10,035 function-calling examples designed to support standardized protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). The research introduces TUCAN (Tool-Using Capable Assistant Navigator), which achieves up to 28.75% improvement in function-calling accuracy over base models while preserving core language understanding, as verified on established Bulgarian benchmarks. Beyond accuracy gains, TUCAN models demonstrate production-ready response formatting with clean, parsable function calls, contrasting with the verbose and inconsistent outputs of base models. The models, evaluation framework, and dataset are released to enable replication for other languages. This work demonstrates a practical approach for extending tool-augmented capabilities beyond English-centric systems.
