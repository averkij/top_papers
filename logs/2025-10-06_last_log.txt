Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT) enhance LLMs' policy compliance assessment by providing detailed reasoning chains, improving accuracy and policy clause citation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Policy compliance assessment is a fundamental task of evaluating whether an input case strictly complies with a set of human-defined rules, more generally known as policies. In practice, human experts follow a systematic, step-by-step process to identify violations with respect to specific stipulations outlined in the policy. However, such documentation of gold-standard, expert-level reasoning processes is costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT), a form of specialized generated reasoning chains that serve as a reasoning bridge to improve an LLM's policy compliance assessment capabilities. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the use of PRTs for both inference-time and training-time scenarios significantly enhances the performance of open-weight and commercial models, setting a new state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. Beyond accuracy gains, we also highlight how PRTs can improve an LLM's ability to accurately cite policy clauses, as well as influence compliance decisions through their high utilization from the raw chains of thought.

Использование PRT как на этапе инференса, так и на этапе обучения значительно повышает точность оценки соответствия для открытых и коммерческих моделей, устанавливая новый state-of-the-art для политик HIPAA и GDPR. Помимо улучшения точности, PRT также повышают способность моделей корректно цитировать конкретные пункты политик при обосновании своих решений.",
