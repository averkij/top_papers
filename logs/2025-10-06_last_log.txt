Text:"REPAIR: Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and Reintegration Yisu Wang, Ming Wang, Haoyuan Song, Wenjie Huang, Chaozheng Wang, Yi Xie & Xuming Ran ContiAI Research xuming@contiai.com.sg Abstract Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervension and Reintegration), lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management. Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects. Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30% across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting. This work introduces robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and continually evolving LLMs. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks. However, their inherent rigidity prevents them from autonomously updating knowledge after pretraining, rendering them unable to correct errors (e.g., hallucinations or outdated facts) or integrate new information. Consequently, lifelong model editing has emerged as critical research paradigm. It aims to enable continuous, efficient, and low-cost local updates that ensure models remain accurate and relevant over time [1]. In contrast to full re-training or broad fine-tuning, editing focuses on precisely fine-grained modifications that preserve unrelated competencies while delivering immediate cor"

SpineMed, an ecosystem with SpineMed-450k and SpineBench, addresses the lack of level-aware, multimodal datasets and benchmarks for AI-assisted diagnosis of spine disorders, improving model performance through fine-grained, level-specific reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized, spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets, and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations, and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes, including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning. Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained, level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks. Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of our model's outputs.

Ключевая особенность — способность моделей анализировать конкретные уровни позвонков на рентгене, КТ и МРТ, что критично для клинической диагностики. Датасет создан при участии практикующих хирургов с использованием двухэтапной генерации данных через LLM (черновик и ревизия). Эксперименты показали, что современные vision-language модели плохо справляются с детальным анализом конкретных позвонков, но файн-тюнинг на SpineMed-450k значительно улучшает качество диагностики.",

"SpineMed, an ecosystem with SpineMed-450k and SpineBench, addresses the lack of level-aware, multimodal datasets and benchmarks for AI-assisted diagnosis of spine disorders, improving model performance through fine-grained, level-specific reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized, spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets, and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations, and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes, including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning. Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained, level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks. Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of our model's outputs."

A new framework, Text Preference Optimization (TPO), aligns text-to-image models with human preferences without requiring paired image preference data, improving text-to-image alignment and human preference scores.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts. However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods, however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables "free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at https://github.com/DSL-Lab/T2I-Free-Lunch-Alignment.
