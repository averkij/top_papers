Text:"5 2 0 2 6 2 ] . [ 1 3 3 0 2 2 . 9 0 5 2 : r arXiv preprint, under review ORTSAE: ORTHOGONAL SPARSE AUTOENCODERS UNCOVER ATOMIC FEATURES Anton Korznikov, Andrey Galichin, Alexey Dontsov, Oleg Y. Rogov, Elena Tutubalina & Ivan OseledetsSparse autoencoders (SAEs) are technique for sparse decomposition of neural network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), novel approach aimed to mitigate these issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features, reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language processing, but their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood. Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how neural networks function by reverse-engineering their computational processes (Olah et al., 2020). Central to this field is understanding features, the human-interpretable concepts represented as directions in models internal representation (Elhage et al., 2022; Park et al., 2023). Early interpretability methods focused on analyzing individual neurons (Olah et al., 2020; Bills et al., 2023), but key challenge has been that neurons are often polysemantic, responding to multiple unrelated concepts rather than encoding single interpretable features (Olah et al., 2020). One theory of why polysemanticity occurs is superposition, which posits that neural networks represent more features than they have dimensions (Elhage et al., 2022). Although this enables efficient use of model capacity, it significantly complicates interpretability research. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful approach to disentangling superposition (Bricken et al., 2023; Cunningham et al., 2023). By adding sparsity penalty to the reconstruction loss, SAEs learn to decompose activations into sparse latent space where each dimension aims to capture distinct, interpretable feature (Gao et al., 2024; Marks et al., 2024). Traditional SAE variants (Bricken et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2024; Bussmann et al., 2024; Rajamanoharan et al., 2024) focused on improving reconstruction quality while maintaining sparsity. However, the standard objective can lead to two failure modes. As the number of SAE latents grows, feature absorption can occur (Fig. 2a), where broad feature representation absorbs into more specific, token-aligned latents (e.g., latent starts with will activate on all tokens starting with E, except for the token elephant) (Chanin et al., 2024). Another issue is feature composition (Fig. 2b), in which independent features (e.g. representing red and square) are merged into single composite feature (red square) (Leask et al., 2025). Both problems undermine the interpretability of SAE latents and the applicability of SAE representations for downstream tasks (Karvonen et al., 2025). To address these Correspondence to korznikovantona@gmail.com These authors contributed equally to this work. 1 arXiv preprint, under review Figure 1: Performance of OrtSAEs vs. traditional SAEs. Bar plots display explained variance, absorption, and composition rates for three SAE variants at L0=70 sparsity. OrtSAEs show marginally lower explained variance than BatchTopK SAEs but decreased absorption and composition, indicating better feature specificity. The density plot illustrates the distribution of pairwise cosine similarity values, computed as the maximum similarity between each decoder feature and its closest counterpart in the model, across all features at L0=70. OrtSAEs demonstrate lower pairwise cosine similarity, confirming greater decoder feature orthogonality compared to BatchTopK and ReLU SAEs. issues, Bussmann et al. (2025) introduced Matryoshka SAE, hierarchical approach to organizing features at multiple levels of abstraction. However, this method introduces additional computational overhead and suffers from feature hedging (Chanin et al., 2025), problem where correlated features merge at higher levels, reducing interpretability. This highlights the need for alternative approaches. Feature absorption and composition lead to redundant representations where multiple latents capture overlapping concepts, which results in high cosine similarities between them. This suggests that enforcing orthogonality between SAE latents could provide principled approach to mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose OrtSAE, novel approach to SAE training that promotes the emergence of more atomic features (Sec. 3.3). At each training step, we penalize high cosine similarities between SAE latents by introducing an additional orthogonality penalty. To optimize computation, we implement chunk-wise strategy that divides SAE latents into smaller blocks, computes the penalty separately, and aggregates the results. This reduces the complexity from quadratic to linear with respect to the number of latents and introduces negligible computational overhead. Importantly, this penalty scales efficiently without altering the core SAE architecture. We train OrtSAE on the Gemma-2-2B (Team et al., 2024) and Llama-3-8B (Dubey et al., 2024) and compare it against traditional SAEs and Matryoshka SAE (Bussmann et al., 2025). Experimental results demonstrate that our objective reduces feature absorption and composition across wide range of sparsity levels (Sec. 4.3). For example, at L0 of 70  (Fig. 1)  , OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features, reduces feature absorption by 65%, and feature composition by 15% compared to traditional SAEs. On SAEBench (Karvonen et al., 2025), our method improves performance on spurious correlation removal by 6% while maintaining on-par performance for other downstream task"

Orthogonal Sparse Autoencoders (OrtSAE) mitigate feature absorption and composition by enforcing orthogonality, leading to better feature discovery and improved performance on spurious correlation removal.  					AI-generated summary 				 Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a technique for sparse decomposition of neural network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features, reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.

Традиционные SAE страдают от проблем поглощения признаков (когда специализированные признаки захватывают общие) и композиции признаков (когда независимые признаки сливаются). OrtSAE решает эти проблемы, добавляя штраф за высокое косинусное сходство между признаками, что обеспечивает их ортогональность и независимость. В результате метод обнаруживает на 9% больше уникальных признаков, снижает поглощение на 65%, композицию на 15% и улучшает производительность в задачах удаления ложных корреляций на 6%.",
