We propose RECAP (Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), principled reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and helpful responses. RECAP trains on mixture of synthetically generated counteraligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness, reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability all while maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override their reasoning. . This paper includes potentially offensive red-teaming data and model-generated content. Date: October 2, 2025 Correspondence: ShengYun Peng speng65@gatech.edu, Jianfeng Chi jianfengchi@meta.com Code: We will release the code shortly. Frontier LRMs, such as DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025), OpenAI-o3 (OpenAI), and Qwen3 (Team, 2025), have achieved remarkable performance in math (Shao et al., 2024) and coding (Jiang et al., 2024a) tasks, where they think by first generating structured CoT reasoning before"

Text:"GAME-TIME: EVALUATING TEMPORAL DYNAMICS IN SPOKEN LANGUAGE MODELS Kai-Wei Chang1, En-Pei Hu2, Chun-Yi Kuan2, Wenze Ren2, Wei-Chih Chen2, Guan-Ting Lin2, Yu Tsao3, Shao-Hua Sun2, Hung-yi Lee2, James Glass1 1 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA 2 National Taiwan University, Taiwan 3 Academia Sinica, Taiwan 5 2 0 2 0 3 ] . e [ 1 8 8 3 6 2 . 9 0 5 2 : r ABSTRACT Conversational Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as promising paradigm for real-time speech interaction. However, their capacity of temporal dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous speaking, remains critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, framework to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans learn language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM architectures reveals clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in time awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides foundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware conversational AI. Demos and datasets are available on our project website1. Index Terms Spoken Language Models, Temporal Dynamics, Full-Duplex Speech, Conversational AI, Benchmark 1. INTRODUCTION In the pursuit of human-like conversation with machines, the research frontier is moving beyond text-based Large Language Models (LLMs). The next challenge lies in mastering conversational dynamics in real-time speech, which has given rise to the field of conversational Spoken Language Models (SLMs) [1, 2"

RECAP, a reinforcement learning method, enhances the safety and robustness of large reasoning models by teaching them to override flawed reasoning and maintain safety without additional training costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP (Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness, reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override their reasoning.

The Game-Time Benchmark evaluates the temporal dynamics and real-time interaction capabilities of conversational spoken language models, highlighting performance gaps in instruction-following and synchronized responses.  					AI-generated summary 				 Conversational Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a promising paradigm for real-time speech interaction. However, their capacity of temporal dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous speaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans learn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM architectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in time awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides a foundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware conversational AI. Demos and datasets are available on our project website https://ga642381.github.io/Game-Time.
