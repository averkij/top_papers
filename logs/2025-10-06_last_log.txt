[ 1 1 4 1 1 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker: Mid-training is all you need SLAM Lab ServiceNowWe present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, 15-billion parameter open-weights multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier-level performance through training design rather than sheer scale. Starting from Pixtral-12B, we apply progressive three-stage methodology: (1) depth upscaling to expand reasoning capacity without pretraining from scratch, (2) staged continual pre-training that first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances visual reasoning through targeted synthetic data generation addressing spatial structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception, and (3) high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning on curated instruction-response pairs with explicit reasoning traces spanning mathematics, coding, science, and tool use. Notably, our model achieves competitive results without reinforcement learning or preference optimization, isolating the contribution of our data-centric continual pre-training approach. On the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker attains score of 52, matching DeepSeek-R1-0528 despite requiring significantly fewer computational resources. Across ten image benchmarks, its performance is on average within five points of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7, key achievement for model operating within single-GPU deployment constraints. Our results demonstrate that thoughtful mid-training 2 design can close substantial capability gaps without massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to organizations with limited infrastructure. We release the model checkpoint, all training recipes, and evaluation protocols under the MIT license to to advance open-source research.Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly across general capability, long-context reasoning, and multimodal understanding. Open-weight families such as Qwen [1, 2] and Llama [3, 4] have demonstrated strong, scalable baselines, while proprietary systems like Gemini [5, 6] and Claude [7] have pushed frontier performance across complex reasoning and multimodal tasks. Recent reasoning-first training approaches, exemplified by DeepSeek-R1 [8], reveal that careful data curation and training strategy can unlock sophisticated chain-of-thought competence without relying solely on extreme scale. Yet despite these advances, fundamental tension persists between Contributors are listed in Section 8 2We define mid-training as combination of the continual pretraining and SFT stages Figure 1: Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker compared to the best open source LLMs on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index. capability and accessibility, as these insights have not fully addressed the challenges facing real-world applications. Two critical barriers remain for widespread adoption. First, organizations requiring on-premises or air-gapped deployments for privacy and compliance need compact models with predictable resource footprints that can operate within strict infrastructure constraints. Second, the cost profile spanning both training and inference often becomes the decisive factor in whether frontier-level capability can be deployed at production scale. These practical considerations raise fundamental question: Can compact, open, multimodal model achieve frontier-level reasoning while remaining economical to train and deploy? This work introduces Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, 15B-parameter open-weights multimodal reasoning model designed with that guiding question in mind. Our approach centers on the midtraining/continual pretraining phase, where both data selection and staged presentation exert strong influence on downstream reasoning. Concretely, the training corpus spans curated pretraining-style corpora, diverse web-style text and images, reasoning-rich samples, and mix of verified and unverified synthetic data, all introduced through staged curriculum. Our core innovation lies in progressive, cost-effective multimodal training pipeline that effectively scales reasoning capabilities across text and vision through three carefully orchestrated stages: (1) Integrated Multimodal Architecture: Beginning with Pixtral-12B [9] as our foundation, we expand it to model size capable of advanced reasoning across modalities, without requiring pretraining from scratch. (2) Staged Multimodal Continual Pretraining (CPT): We adopt two-phase CPT strategy. The first phase develops foundational text reasoning and broad multimodal capabilities, while the second enhances visual reasoning through synthetic data targeting spatial structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception. This staged progression enables balanced strengthening of both modalities and provides stable foundation for subsequent training stages, even when later stages emphasize narrower set of modalities. (3) High-Quality Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): We curate diverse, high-quality, and high-signal set of samples for supervised fine-tuning. Each response includes explicit reasoning traces, enabling the model to learn transparent thought processes. Coupled with the strong base model, this yields frontier-level performance across broad range of reasoning benchmarks without requiring additional post-training. Given computational constraints, the current release focuses on maximizing the potential of the base model through mid-training, without employing reinforcement learning or preference optimization. 2 This design choice also allows for clearer assessment of the contribution of the mid-training recipe itself to the overall performance of the model. The result is compact model tailored to enterprise-friendly deployment constraints (memory, latency, throughput) while still achieving frontier-level reasoning. Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker attains score of 52 on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, matching DeepSeek-R1-0528 [10] despite requiring significantly fewer computational resources. Across ten multimodal benchmarks, the model demonstrates competitive performance, averaging only 5 points behind Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7 [6, 7], remarkable achievement for 15B parameter model operating within singleGPU deployment constraints. These empirical results provide compelling evidence that thoughtful continual pre-training with heterogeneous synthetic signals, applied to compact architecture, can close substantial capability gaps without "

Text:"LEAML: Label-Efficient Adaptation to Out-of-Distribution Visual Tasks for Multimodal Large Language Models Ci-Siang Lin1 Yu-Chiang Frank Wang1,2 1Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan 2NVIDIA Min-Hung Chen2 Yu-Yang Sheng1 5 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 2 3 2 3 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r Abstract Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and expensive. We introduce LEAML, labelefficient adaptation framework that leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled data using QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering, enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domainspecific knowledge during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML framework. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) (Touvron et al. 2023; Achiam et al. 2023; Bai et al. 2023) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse language tasks. By incorporating visual understanding, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) (Alayrac et al. 2022; Liu et al. 2023a; Wang et al. 2024a) extend these capabilities to visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, and multimodal reasoning tasks. (Wang et al. 2024b) Recent MLLMs have achieved remarkable performance on general visual benchmarks, showing strong generalization within their training distributions. Although scaling laws (Kaplan et al. 2020) show promise for enhancing model performance, they do not eliminate dependence on pre-training data, which limits generali"

I. INTRODUCTION Autonomous driving has progressed rapidly, with milestones like Waymos fully autonomous robotaxi services demonstrating SAE Level 4 capabilities in defined urban environments [1], [2]. These achievements are built on either modular software stacks covering perception, prediction, planning, and control [3], or more recently, end-to-end learning-based approaches [4]. However, both paradigms face fundamental limitation: they struggle to handle the variability of real-world driving, particularly the rare, safetycritical corner cases that fall outside their operational design domains (ODDs) [5]. Ensuring trustworthiness requires methods that can reason beyond hand-crafted rules or training data distributions. Recent advances in VLMs offer such potential: by combining scalable, cross-modal knowledge with flexible reasoning, they can improve the coverage of autonomous driving tasks, complementing traditional AD software stacks [6]. Despite this potential, the application of VLMs to autonomous driving has been focused on scenario risk assessment, such as hazard detection [7] or qualitative risk assessment [8].

NuRisk introduces an agent-level quantitative dataset that enables (iii) spatialtemporal quantitative assessment for risk reasoning. hazard, they typically lack the quantitative reasoning required for rigorous safety evaluation. For example, VLM can identify vehicle cutting into the ego-cars lane yet offer qualitative assessment like, This is dangerous situation, please drive slowly, which encourages conservative behavior. This raises question: can pre-trained VLMs perform agent-level quantitative risk assessment by leveraging spatiotemporal reasoning to interpret safety metrics, such as the temporal metric Time-to-Collision (TTC) and the spatial metric Distance to Collision (DTC)? Our work, illustrated in Figure 1, confronts this question by proposing Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset to evaluate this capability. Such quantitative insights are crucial for downstream motion planners to make informed, precise decisions rather than resorting to overly conservative maneuvers. A. Related Work 1) VLMs in Autonomous Driving: Recent studies have explored the integration of VLMs into autonomous driving systems. Surveys such as [6], [9] provide comprehensive overviews of the role of VLMs in tasks including perception, motion planning, scene understanding, and visual reasoning. In the context of scenario analysis, VLMs have shown promising progress. Recently, comprehensive survey [10] summarizes four main application areas of VLMs-based scenario analysis: VQA dataset, scene understanding, benchmark, and risk assessment. 2) VLMs-based Risk Assessment in Autonomous Driving: Current approaches to VLM-based risk assessment can be categorized into two paradigms: prompting-based and finetuning-based methods. Prompting-based approaches adapt the reasoning capabilities of large pre-trained models via instructions. GPT-4V has been applied to structured scene representations for risk scoring with natural language justifications [11], demonstrating the potential for interpretable risk assessment. Similarly, frameworks like LATTE [7] and Ronecker et al. [12] integrate visual foundation models with contextual prompting for hazard detection and anomaly recognition. Fine-tuning strategies like LoRA [13] have emerged to address domain-specific requirements and improve robustness by training model parameters specifically. Think-Driver [14] fine-tunes VLM with chain-of-thought style VQA data with multi-view images for hazard reasoning and maneuver risk evaluation. By decomposing risk assessment into sequential reasoning steps, this approach provides more transparent and auditable decision-making processes compared to direct predictions. Lee et al. [15] adapt VLMs to occlusion-aware BEV representations for uncertainty prediction, while works like INSIGHT [16] enhance hazard localization and interpretability. And LKAlert [17] focuses on failure anticipation by predicting lane-keeping assist failures using multimodal cues. These methods are focused on qualitative agent risk assessment. However, these methods all lack the quantitative labels required for explicit spatio-temporal reasoning, which is gap our NuRisk dataset is precisely designed to fill. 3) VQA datasets in Autonomous Driving: VQA datasets for autonomous driv"

A 15-billion parameter multimodal reasoning model achieves competitive performance through a progressive training methodology without reinforcement learning, demonstrating efficient use of computational resources.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter open-weights multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier-level performance through training design rather than sheer scale. Starting from Pixtral-12B, we apply a progressive three-stage methodology: (1) depth upscaling to expand reasoning capacity without pretraining from scratch, (2) staged continual pre-training that first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances visual reasoning through targeted synthetic data generation addressing spatial structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception, and (3) high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning on curated instruction-response pairs with explicit reasoning traces spanning mathematics, coding, science, and tool use. Notably, our model achieves competitive results without reinforcement learning or preference optimization, isolating the contribution of our data-centric continual pre-training approach. On the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker attains a score of 52, matching DeepSeek-R1-0528 despite requiring significantly fewer computational resources. Across ten image benchmarks, its performance is on average within five points of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7, a key achievement for a model operating within single-GPU deployment constraints. Our results demonstrate that thoughtful mid-training 2 design can close substantial capability gaps without massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to organizations with limited infrastructure. We release the model checkpoint, all training recipes, and evaluation protocols under the MIT license to to advance open-source research.

LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework, enhances MLLMs for specialized domains by generating pseudo question-answer pairs and selectively updating relevant neurons, outperforming standard fine-tuning with minimal supervision.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering, enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML framework.

NuRisk, a comprehensive VQA dataset, addresses the lack of spatio-temporal reasoning in current VLMs for autonomous driving by providing agent-level risk annotations in sequential images, improving accuracy and reducing latency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context. Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View (BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations, enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency. To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to 41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.
