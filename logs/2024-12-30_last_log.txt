[ 1 3 5 6 8 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r Figure 1. Visual comparisons between FLUX and 1.58-bit FLUX. 1.58-bit FLUX demonstrates comparable generation quality to FLUX while employing 1.58-bit quantization, where 99.5% of the 11.9B parameters in the vision transformer are constrained to the values +1, -1, or 0. For consistency, all images in each comparison are generated using the same latent noise input. 1.58-bit FLUX utilizes custom 1.58-bit kernel. Additional visual comparisons are provided in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. 1 Figure 2. Efficiency measurements on the vision transformer component of FLUX and 1.58-bit FLUX. The measurements are based on generating single image with 50 inference steps. (a) 1.58-bit FLUX reduces checkpoint storage by 7.7 compared to FLUX. (b) 1.58-bit FLUX achieves 5.1 reduction in inference memory usage across various GPU types. The x-axis labels, m-nG, represent GPU type with maximum memory capacity of Gigabytes (G). "

We present 1.58-bit FLUX, the first successful approach to quantizing the state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model, FLUX.1-dev, using 1.58-bit weights (i.e., values in {-1, 0, +1}) while maintaining comparable performance for generating 1024 x 1024 images. Notably, our quantization method operates without access to image data, relying solely on self-supervision from the FLUX.1-dev model. Additionally, we develop a custom kernel optimized for 1.58-bit operations, achieving a 7.7x reduction in model storage, a 5.1x reduction in inference memory, and improved inference latency.
