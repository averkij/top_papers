Text:"SBS Figures: Pre-training Figure QA from Stage-by-Stage Synthesized Images Risa Shinoda12, Kuniaki Saito2, Shohei Tanaka2, Tosho Hirasawa2, Yoshitaka Ushiku2 1Kyoto University, Japan 2OMRON SINIC Corp., Japan {risa.shinoda, kuniaki.saito, shohei.tanaka, tosho.hirasawa, yoshitaka.ushiku}@sinicx.com 4 2 0 2 3 2 ] . [ 1 6 0 6 7 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r Abstract Building large-scale figure QA dataset requires considerable amount of work, from gathering and selecting figures to extracting attributes like text, numbers, and colors, and generating QAs. Although recent developments in LLMs have led to efforts to synthesize figures, most of these focus primarily on QA generation. Additionally, creating figures directly using LLMs often encounters issues such as code errors, similar-looking figures, and repetitive content in figures. To address this issue, we present SBS Figures (Stage-by-Stage Synthetic Figures), dataset for pre-training figure QA. Our proposed pipeline enables the creation of chart figures with complete annotations of the visualized data and dense QA annotations without any manual annotation process. Our stageby-stage pipeline makes it possible to create diverse topic and appearance figures efficiently while minimizing code errors. Our SBS Figures demonstrate strong pre-training effect, making it possible to achieve efficient training with limited amount of real-world chart data starting from our pre-trained weights. Our code is available at https://github.com/omronsinicx/SBSFigures. Building models that understand figures is essential for automating document understanding, given that numerous documents incorporate figures for data visualization. Understanding figures necessitates two key abilities of models: (i) precise interpretation of visualized information, encompassing numerical data, labels, and plot positions, and (ii) reasoning to return accurate responses based on the visualized information and user queries. densely annotated dataset with many graph figure"
