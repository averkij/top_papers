We present FreeMorph, the first tuning-free method for image morphing that accommodates inputs with different semantics or layouts. Unlike existing methods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by time constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers high-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.

В отличие от существующих методов, основанных на дообучении предобученных диффузионных моделей, FreeMorph обеспечивает высококачественный морфинг без необходимости обучения для каждого конкретного случая. Метод включает в себя два ключевых нововведения: сферическую интерполяцию с учетом управления и ориентированную на шаги тенденцию изменения. Эксперименты показывают, что FreeMorph превосходит существующие методы, работая в 10-50 раз быстрее и устанавливая новый стандарт качества в области морфинга изображений.",
