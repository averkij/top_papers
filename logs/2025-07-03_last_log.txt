Automated radiology report generation (RRG) aims to produce detailed textual reports from clinical imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and provision of management advice. RRG is complicated by two key challenges: (1) inherent complexity in extracting relevant information from imaging data under resource constraints, and (2) difficulty in objectively evaluating discrepancies between model-generated and expertwritten reports. To address these challenges, we propose µ2LLM, multiscale multimodal large language models for RRG tasks. The novel µ2Tokenizer, as an intermediate layer, integrates multi-modal features from the multiscale visual tokenizer and the text tokenizer, then enhances report generation quality through direct preference optimization (DPO), guided by GREEN-RedLlama. Experimental results on four large CT image-report medical datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, highlighting the potential of our fine-tuned µ2LLMs on limited data for RRG tasks. At the same time, for prompt engineering, we introduce five-stage, LLM-driven pipeline that converts routine CT reports into paired visual-question-a"
