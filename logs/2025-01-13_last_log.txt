Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) (Achiam et al., 2023; Anthropic, 2024; Qwen-Team, 2024) represent significant milestones in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). They rely on human supervision signals through methods such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement *Equal contribution 1The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China 2Qwen Team, Alibaba Inc., Beijing, China 3Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data, Shenzhen, China. Correspondence to: Tian Ding <dingtian@cuhk.edu.cn>, Benyou Wang <wangbenyou@cuhk.edu.cn>, Dayiheng Liu <liudayiheng.ldyh@alibaba-inc.com>. Preprint. Work in Progress. 1 Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022). As result, these models have evolved at an unprecedented pace, surpassing human capabilities in certain challenging domains. However, this framework encounters fundamental challenge: how to provide effective and scalable feedback for LLMs in tasks that are not only difficult for humans to evaluate but where LLMs may outperform humans. This challenge, known as scalable oversight (Bowman et al., 2022), remains critical, yet progress in this area has been limited. To address this challenge, promising direction is to leverage LLMs themselves to assist in the evaluation process, enabling further refinement of model outputs (Saunders et al., 2022; McAleese et al., 2024). At the heart of this approach lies the critique ability - the capability to identify and rectify flaws in model responses. When critique feedback is accurate and informative, LLMs can refine their outputs, advancing toward higher-order intelligence. However, existing studies indicate that LLMs exhibit weak performance in critique tasks (Zheng et al., 2024b; Yang et al., 2024), despite their strong problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, enhancing critique abilities becomes an important research problem, one that this paper also seeks to address. Current approaches to improving the critique abilities of LLMs rely on two sources of supervision: human annotations (Saunders et al., 2022; McAleese et al., 2024) and stronger LLMs that serve as human proxy (e.g., GPT-4 and o1-mini) (Lan et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024b; Yang et al., 2024)). While these methods have shown promise, they face three fundamental limitations. First, the quality of generated critiques is inherently bounded by the capabilities of the supervisors. Second, the dependence on human annotations or API calls to stronger models introduces significant costs, limiting the scalability of these approaches. Most critically, these approaches fail to address fundamental question in scalable oversight: how can we enhance the critique abilities of our most capable models when stronger supervisors are no longer available? In this work, we introduce SCRIT (Self-evolving CRITic), framework that enables LLMs to develop self-evolving critique abilities. We focus on mathematical reasoning tasks as an ideal testbed for this approach, where critique refers Enabling Scalable Oversight via Self-Evolving Critic Figure 1: Performance comparison between Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (base model), +SCRIT (self-evolved model) across two complementary evaluation protocols to assess different aspects of critique capabilities. to the process of identifying and correcting errors in potentially imperfect solution (referred to as student solution for simplicity). key insight of our approach is that mathematical reasoning problems typically have well-defined reference solutions and corresponding final answers. These resources not only guide the critique of students solution but also help verify the quality of the generated critique. Specifically, our framework consists of two key steps to generate high-quality critique data for self-training. First, we develop contrastive critique technique, where the model is provided with reference solution to analyze and critique students solution. This step is grounded in our first philosophy: by conditioning on correct reference solution, the LLM can acquire deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and solving strategies, enabling it to identify and correct errors in student solutions. Notably, this approach does not rely on external supervision from humans or stronger models, yet it proves more effective than direct critique methods (see Figure 2). Next, the LLM is tasked with self-validating the generated critique. Specifically, the model checks whether the proposed corrections lead to mathematically valid solutions. This step is based on our second philosophy: critiques that result in internally consistent and correct correction are considered high-quality, which has also been widely adopted by recent works (Zheng et al., 2024b; Yang et al., 2024). These two steps together enable the generation of highquality critique data without human supervisions in writing good critiques for student solutions. Finally, we use the self-critic and self-validated data to continuously enhance the models critique abilities throug"

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful strategy to address the issue of generating factually incorrect outputs in foundation models by retrieving external knowledge relevant to queries and incorporating it into their generation process. However, existing RAG approaches have primarily focused on textual information, with some recent advancements beginning to consider images, and they largely overlook videos, a rich source of multimodal knowledge capable of representing events, processes, and contextual details more effectively than any other modality. While a few recent studies explore the integration of videos in the response generation process, they either predefine query-associated videos without retrieving them according to queries, or convert videos into the textual descriptions without harnessing their multimodal richness. To tackle these, we introduce VideoRAG, a novel framework that not only dynamically retrieves relevant videos based on their relevance with queries but also utilizes both visual and textual information of videos in the output generation. Further, to operationalize this, our method revolves around the recent advance of Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), which enable the direct processing of video content to represent it for retrieval and seamless integration of the retrieved videos jointly with queries. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of VideoRAG, showcasing that it is superior to relevant baselines.

"Despite their remarkable performance, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical challenge in scalable oversight: providing effective feedback for tasks where human evaluation is difficult or where LLMs outperform humans. While there is growing interest in using LLMs for critique, current approaches still rely on human annotations or more powerful models, leaving the issue of enhancing critique capabilities without external supervision unresolved. We introduce SCRIT (Self-evolving CRITic), a framework that enables genuine self-evolution of critique abilities. Technically, SCRIT self-improves by training on synthetic data, generated by a contrastive-based self-critic that uses reference solutions for step-by-step critique, and a self-validation mechanism that ensures critique quality through correction outcomes. Implemented with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, one of the most powerful LLMs, SCRIT achieves up to a 10.3\% improvement on critique-correction and error identification benchmarks. Our analysis reveals that SCRIT's performance scales positively with data and model size, outperforms alternative approaches, and benefits critically from its self-validation component."

Reasoning is a fundamental capability for solving complex multi-step problems, particularly in visual contexts where sequential step-wise understanding is essential. Existing approaches lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating visual reasoning and do not emphasize step-wise problem-solving. To this end, we propose a comprehensive framework for advancing step-by-step visual reasoning in large language models (LMMs) through three key contributions. First, we introduce a visual reasoning benchmark specifically designed to evaluate multi-step reasoning tasks. The benchmark presents a diverse set of challenges with eight different categories ranging from complex visual perception to scientific reasoning with over 4k reasoning steps in total, enabling robust evaluation of LLMs' abilities to perform accurate and interpretable visual reasoning across multiple steps. Second, we propose a novel metric that assesses visual reasoning quality at the granularity of individual steps, emphasizing both correctness and logical coherence. The proposed metric offers deeper insights into reasoning performance compared to traditional end-task accuracy metrics. Third, we present a new multimodal visual reasoning model, named LlamaV-o1, trained using a multi-step curriculum learning approach, where tasks are progressively organized to facilitate incremental skill acquisition and problem-solving. The proposed LlamaV-o1 is designed for multi-step reasoning and learns step-by-step through a structured training paradigm. Extensive experiments show that our LlamaV-o1 outperforms existing open-source models and performs favorably against close-source proprietary models. Compared to the recent Llava-CoT, our LlamaV-o1 achieves an average score of 67.3 with an absolute gain of 3.8\% across six benchmarks while being 5 times faster during inference scaling. Our benchmark, model, and code are publicly available.
