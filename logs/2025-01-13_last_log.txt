Text:"David A. Noever Forrest McKee PeopleTec, Inc., Huntsville, AL david.noever@peopletec.com forrest.mckee@peopletec.com ABSTRACT This study demonstrates novel approach to testing the security boundaries of Vision-Large Language Model (VLM/ LLM) using the EICAR test file embedded within JPEG images. We successfully executed four distinct protocols across multiple LLM platforms, including OpenAI GPT-4o, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet (2025). The experiments validated that modified JPEG containing the EICAR signature could be uploaded, manipulated, and potentially executed within LLM virtual workspaces. Key findings include: 1) consistent ability to mask the EICAR string in image metadata without detection, 2) successful extraction of the test file using Python-based manipulation within LLM environments, and 3) demonstration of multiple obfuscation techniques including base64 encoding and string reversal. This research extends Microsoft Research's "Penetration Testing Rules of Engagement" framework to evaluate cloud-based generative AI and LLM security boundaries, particularly focusing on file handling and execution capabilities within containerized environments. This short research note highlights previously unstudied example of implanting viral surrogate on hosted foundational large language model (LLM) [1-5]. popular and safe capture-the-flag contest offers surrogate viral example used in penetration tests, often described as concluding when user can drop an EICAR [6]. EICAR is plain ASCII text file [3] and innocuous dummy virus that traditionally serves as file marker to evaluate the sensitivity of major antivirus detectors [7]. On VirusTotal [8-9], for example, 63 out of 66 virus detectors flag any file containing string: X5O!P%@AP[4PZX54(P)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!-- the ETC.

Structured image understanding, such as interpreting tables and charts, requires strategically refocusing across various structures and texts within an image, forming a reasoning sequence to arrive at the final answer. However, current multimodal large language models (LLMs) lack this multihop selective attention capability. In this work, we introduce ReFocus, a simple yet effective framework that equips multimodal LLMs with the ability to generate "visual thoughts" by performing visual editing on the input image through code, shifting and refining their visual focuses. Specifically, ReFocus enables multimodal LLMs to generate Python codes to call tools and modify the input image, sequentially drawing boxes, highlighting sections, and masking out areas, thereby enhancing the visual reasoning process. We experiment upon a wide range of structured image understanding tasks involving tables and charts. ReFocus largely improves performance on all tasks over GPT-4o without visual editing, yielding an average gain of 11.0% on table tasks and 6.8% on chart tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of the effects of different visual edits, and reasons why ReFocus can improve the performance without introducing additional information. Further, we collect a 14k training set using ReFocus, and prove that such visual chain-of-thought with intermediate information offers a better supervision than standard VQA data, reaching a 8.0% average gain over the same model trained with QA pairs and 2.6% over CoT.

"Structured image understanding, such as interpreting tables and charts, requires strategically refocusing across various structures and texts within an image, forming a reasoning sequence to arrive at the final answer. However, current multimodal large language models (LLMs) lack this multihop selective attention capability. In this work, we introduce ReFocus, a simple yet effective framework that equips multimodal LLMs with the ability to generate "visual thoughts" by performing visual editing on the input image through code, shifting and refining their visual focuses. Specifically, ReFocus enables multimodal LLMs to generate Python codes to call tools and modify the input image, sequentially drawing boxes, highlighting sections, and masking out areas, thereby enhancing the visual reasoning process. We experiment upon a wide range of structured image understanding tasks involving tables and charts. ReFocus largely improves performance on all tasks over GPT-4o without visual editing, yielding an average gain of 11.0% on table tasks and 6.8% on chart tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of the effects of different visual edits, and reasons why ReFocus can improve the performance without introducing additional information. Further, we collect a 14k training set using ReFocus, and prove that such visual chain-of-thought with intermediate information offers a better supervision than standard VQA data, reaching a 8.0% average gain over the same model trained with QA pairs and 2.6% over CoT."

This study demonstrates a novel approach to testing the security boundaries of Vision-Large Language Model (VLM/ LLM) using the EICAR test file embedded within JPEG images. We successfully executed four distinct protocols across multiple LLM platforms, including OpenAI GPT-4o, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The experiments validated that a modified JPEG containing the EICAR signature could be uploaded, manipulated, and potentially executed within LLM virtual workspaces. Key findings include: 1) consistent ability to mask the EICAR string in image metadata without detection, 2) successful extraction of the test file using Python-based manipulation within LLM environments, and 3) demonstration of multiple obfuscation techniques including base64 encoding and string reversal. This research extends Microsoft Research's "Penetration Testing Rules of Engagement" framework to evaluate cloud-based generative AI and LLM security boundaries, particularly focusing on file handling and execution capabilities within containerized environments.
