Specifically, dialects often differ from their standard language in terms of pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary, whereas the more commonly used term accent typically refers to differences in pronunciation and prosody (intonation, rhythm, phrasing). In this paper, we primarily focus on dialect classification. For example, the English language has multiple dialects worldwide, including American, British, Singaporean, and Indian English, each with its distinct linguistic features. common example is the word for mechanical lift, where elevator is used in American English, while lift is preferred in British English. Similarly, Mandarin Chinese has many regional dialects across China, such as the Beijing and the Sichuan dialects. For example, while Beijing Mandarin > úù] in the retroflex place of articulation, the Sichuan dialects articulates the retroflex consonants such as zh [ > typically merge them with their alveolar counterparts, pronouncing them as [ ts]. Apart from dialectal variation within single language, some countries, such as India, have wide range of regional languages (as well as their dialectal varieties), with neighboring states speaking distinct but culturally connected languages, such as Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam. Classifying dialects (as well as regional languages) is important for building robust speech technologies that accommodate diverse linguistic contexts. However, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often exhibit substantial disparities across dialectal varieties of the same language. For example, while many ASR systems perform well on speech samples of widely explored varieties, their accuracy drops significantly for under-represented dialects such as African American Vernacular English and Chicano English, reflecting biases in their training corpora [1, 2]. Similarly, KeSpeech [3] demonstrates that the state-of-the-art ASR systems show significantly lower performance on eight Mandarin dialectal varieties compared to Standard Mandarin. Such performance differences can reduce the reliability and usability of the systems and their applications, such 1 University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA (corresponding emails: tiantiaf@usc.edu. 1 Tiantian Feng et al.

Text:"ReMoMask: Retrieval-Augmented Masked Motion Generation Zhengdao Li1 Siheng Wang2 Zeyu Zhang1 Hao Tang1 1Peking University 2Jiangsu University Equal contribution. Project lead. Corresponding author: bjdxtanghao@gmail.com. 5 2 0 2 4 ] . [ 1 5 0 6 2 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r Abstract Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However, current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, unified framework integrating three key innovations: 1) Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) Semantic Spatiotemporal Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMasks RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving 3.88% and 10.97% improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M. Code: https://github.com/ AIGeeksGroup/ReMoMask. Website: https://aigeeksgroup. github.io/ReMoMask. Introduction Human motion generation has attracted growing attention due to its broad applicability in domains such as gaming, film production (Zhang et al. 2024e), virtual reality, and robotics. Recent advancements aim to synthesize diverse and realistic motions to reduce manual animation costs and enhance content"

Text:"Embedding-Aware Quantum-Classical SVMs for Scalable Quantum Machine Learning Sebastián Andrés Cajas Ordóñez1,*, Luis Fernando Torres Torres2, Mario Bifulco3, Carlos Andres Duran4, Cristian Bosch1 and Ricardo Simon Carbajo1 1National Irish Centre for AI (CeADAR), University College Dublin (UCD), Dublin, Ireland 2SISTEMIC Research Group, University of Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia 3Department of Computer Science, University of Torino, Torino, Italy 4Corporation for Aerospace Initiatives (CASIRI), University of Cauca, Popayán, Colombia Abstract Quantum Support Vector Machines face scalability challenges due to high-dimensional quantum states and hardware limitations. We propose an embedding-aware quantum-classical pipeline combining class-balanced k-means distillation with pretrained Vision Transformer embeddings. Our key finding: ViT embeddings uniquely enable quantum advantage, achieving up to 8.02% accuracy improvements over classical SVMs on FashionMNIST and 4.42% on MNIST, while CNN features show performance degradation. Using 16-qubit tensor network simulation via cuTensorNet, we provide the first systematic evidence that quantum kernel advantage depends critically on embedding choice, revealing fundamental synergy between transformer attention and quantum feature spaces. This provides practical pathway for scalable quantum machine learning that leverages modern neural architectures.

Voxlect is a benchmark for evaluating speech foundation models on dialect classification and downstream applications across multiple languages and dialects.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Voxlect, a novel benchmark for modeling dialects and regional languages worldwide using speech foundation models. Specifically, we report comprehensive benchmark evaluations on dialects and regional language varieties in English, Arabic, Mandarin and Cantonese, Tibetan, Indic languages, Thai, Spanish, French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Italian. Our study used over 2 million training utterances from 30 publicly available speech corpora that are provided with dialectal information. We evaluate the performance of several widely used speech foundation models in classifying speech dialects. We assess the robustness of the dialectal models under noisy conditions and present an error analysis that highlights modeling results aligned with geographic continuity. In addition to benchmarking dialect classification, we demonstrate several downstream applications enabled by Voxlect. Specifically, we show that Voxlect can be applied to augment existing speech recognition datasets with dialect information, enabling a more detailed analysis of ASR performance across dialectal variations. Voxlect is also used as a tool to evaluate the performance of speech generation systems. Voxlect is publicly available with the license of the RAIL family at: https://github.com/tiantiaf0627/voxlect.

ReMoMask, a unified framework, addresses limitations in text-to-motion generation by integrating a Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model, Semantic Spatio-temporal Attention, and RAG-Classier-Free Guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on HumanML3D and KIT-ML benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However, current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97% improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M.

State-of-the-art vision language models struggle with accurately attributing artists and distinguishing AI-generated images, highlighting the need for improvement to prevent misinformation.  					AI-generated summary 				 The attribution of artworks in general and of paintings in particular has always been an issue in art. The advent of powerful artificial intelligence models that can generate and analyze images creates new challenges for painting attribution. On the one hand, AI models can create images that mimic the style of a painter, which can be incorrectly attributed, for example, by other AI models. On the other hand, AI models may not be able to correctly identify the artist for real paintings, inducing users to incorrectly attribute paintings. In this paper, both problems are experimentally studied using state-of-the-art AI models for image generation and analysis on a large dataset with close to 40,000 paintings from 128 artists. The results show that vision language models have limited capabilities to: 1) perform canvas attribution and 2) to identify AI generated images. As users increasingly rely on queries to AI models to get information, these results show the need to improve the capabilities of VLMs to reliably perform artist attribution and detection of AI generated images to prevent the spread of incorrect information.

Combining Vision Transformer embeddings with quantum-classical pipelines achieves quantum advantage in classification tasks, demonstrating the importance of embedding choice in quantum machine learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Quantum Support Vector Machines face scalability challenges due to high-dimensional quantum states and hardware limitations. We propose an embedding-aware quantum-classical pipeline combining class-balanced k-means distillation with pretrained Vision Transformer embeddings. Our key finding: ViT embeddings uniquely enable quantum advantage, achieving up to 8.02% accuracy improvements over classical SVMs on Fashion-MNIST and 4.42% on MNIST, while CNN features show performance degradation. Using 16-qubit tensor network simulation via cuTensorNet, we provide the first systematic evidence that quantum kernel advantage depends critically on embedding choice, revealing fundamental synergy between transformer attention and quantum feature spaces. This provides a practical pathway for scalable quantum machine learning that leverages modern neural architectures.
