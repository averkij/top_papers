Over the past few years, remarkable progress has been achieved in this domain, particularly with the advent of diffusion-based architectures (Ho et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022) that enable high-resolution image generation while capturing fine-grained semantic details. Despite these advances, two critical challenges persist. First, for text-to-image generation, aligning model outputs with complex, multifaceted prompts remains significant hurdle. Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art commercial models such as GPT Image 1 (OpenAI, 2025) and Seedream 3.0 (Gao et al., 2025) struggle when faced with tasks requiring multi-line text rendering, non-alphabetic languages rendering (e.g., Chinese), localized text insertions, or seamless integration of text and visual elements. Second, for image editing, achieving precise alignment between the edited output and the original image poses dual challenges: (i) visual consistency, where only targeted regions should be modified while preserving all other visual details (e.g., changing hair color without altering facial details) and (ii) semantic coherence, where global semantics must be preserved during structural changes (e.g., modifying persons pose while maintaining identity and scene coherence). In this work, we introduce Qwen-Image, novel image generation model within the Qwen series, designed to overcome these challenges through comprehensive data engineering, progressive learning strategies, enhanced multi-task training paradigms, and scalable infrastructure optimization. To address the challenge of complex prompt alignment, we develop robust data pipeline encompassing large-scale collection, annotation, filtering, synthetic augmentation, and class balancing. We further adopt curriculum learning strategy, starting from basic text rendering tasks and progressively advancing to paragraph-level and layout-sensitive descriptions. This approach significantly enhances the models ability to follow diverse languages, especially logographic languages like Chinese. To address the challenge of image alignment, we propose an enhanced multi-task learning framework that seamlessly integrates T2I,I2I and TI2I objectives within shared latent space. Specifically, the input image is encoded into two distinct yet complementary feature representations: semantic features are extracted via Qwen-"

Text:"Exploitation Is All You Need... for Exploration Micah Rentschler1, Jesse Roberts1 1Tennessee Technological University mrentschler@tntech.edu, jtroberts@tntech.edu 5 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 7 8 2 1 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r Abstract Ensuring sufficient exploration is central challenge when training meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments. Conventional solutions to the explorationexploitation dilemma inject explicit incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained solely to maximize greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1) Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data; and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory are present, policy trained on strictly greedy objective exhibits information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2). Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not always prevent emergent explorationa result we attribute to the pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal objectives but can emerge from unified reward-maximization process. Consider children playing hide-and-go-seek repeatedly. The seeker, eager to win, pa"

Qwen-Image, an image generation model, advances text rendering and image editing through a comprehensive data pipeline, progressive training, and dual-encoding mechanism.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection, filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering, evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result, Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

"Qwen-Image, an image generation model, advances text rendering and image editing through a comprehensive data pipeline, progressive training, and dual-encoding mechanism.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise image editing.

Meta-reinforcement learning agents can exhibit exploratory behavior when trained with a greedy objective, provided the environment has recurring structure, the agent has memory, and long-horizon credit assignment is possible.  					AI-generated summary 				 Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments. Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1) Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data; and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2). Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.
