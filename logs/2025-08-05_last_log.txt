Introduction In recent years, multitude of text-to-image generative models have emerged, captivating the field with their remarkable generative capabilities and exceptional image quality (Rombach et al. 2022; Saharia et al. 2022; Ramesh et al. 2022; Podell et al. 2023; Bai et al. 2023, 2024b). These models have made profound impact on various domains, demonstrating their potential in creative content generation. However, due to the vast and largely unregulated nature of the internet data used to train these models (Schuhmann et al. 2022; Rombach et al. 2022; Bai et al. 2024a), there is an inherent risk that they may produce inappropriate content, including images that depict hate, violence, pornography, or even facilitate illegal activities when maliciously exploited (Schramowski et al. 2023; Rando et al. 2022). In response to this concern, several pioneering efforts have been made to mitigate the generation of harmful content (Schramowski et al. 2023; Gandikota et al. 2023; Ku1 TeleAI, China Telecom, 2 Peking University, 3 Yale University, 4 National University of Singapore Project Lead, Corresponding Author. Figure 1: Personalized Safety Alignment Overview. PSA adjusts T2I generation based on user safety profiles. Rows represent users with increasing safety sensitivity (top to bottom). For Hate (left) and Self-Harm (right), more resilient users see permissive content, while vulnerable users receive increasingly filtered outputs. Right column: unaligned base model generations. PSA enables fine-grained, user-aware safety control. mari et al. 2023; Gandikota et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2024; Lu et al. 2024; Liu et al. 2024a). Among these, SLD (Schramowski et al. 2023) introduces mechanism for realtime detection and suppression of harmful content during the diffusion process, ensuring safe generation without the need for retraining the model; ESD (Gandikota et al. 2023) employs fine-tuning approach to permanently remove specific harmful concepts from the model weights; UCE (Gandikota et al. 2024) offers closed-form solution to address range of safety issues, including bias, copyright concerns, and inappropriate content; and SafetyDPO (Liu et al. 2024a) focuses on preference optimization and trains safety expert module to significantly enhance the ability to remove harmful concepts. Despite the promising results demonstrated by these approaches, significant limitation persists: their safety mechanisms largely rely on an unrealistic assumption that all users share uniform tolerance for harmful content. This one-size-fits-all approach is inherently flawed, as it fails to account for the diverse and nuanced safety preferences that users may have with respect to sensitive content, such as violence, pornography, or politically charged material. These preferences are shaped by various factors, including an individuals age, cultural background, religious beliefs, and physical and mental health, highlighting the need for more personalized approach to content filtering. In this paper, we propose the PSA framework, which enables personalized safety alignment in text-to-image generation models by incorporating individualized user safety preferences. Unlike traditional global safety mechanisms (Schramowski et al. 2023; Gandikota et al. 2023; Kumari et al. 2023; Gandikota et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2024; Liu et al. 2024a), PSA adapts the safety standards during the generation process based on the users unique characteristics, such as age, gender, and cultural background. Furthermore, we introduce Sage (Safety-aware generation for everyone), the first text-to-image dataset designed to support personalized safety training. It encompasses ten safetysensitive categories and more than 800 harmful concepts, each paired with high-quality images and corresponding prompts. Differing from existing datasets (Lin et al. 2014; Qu et al. 2023; Schramowski et al. 2023; Liu et al. 2024b,a), the Sage dataset is unique in that it incorporates semantically rich safety preferences, providing tailored and precise support for personalized safety training. Finally, through comprehensive experimentation, we validate the superior performance of the PSA framework, demonstrating its significant advantages over existing methods in terms of harmful content suppression and personalized safety alignment (Schramowski et al. 2023; Gandikota et al. 2023, 2024; Liu et al. 2024a). Figure 1 illustrates how PSA adjusts textto-image generation outputs from permissive to restrictive based on user profiles. We believe that this work will serve as catalyst for new wave of personalized safety alignment, moving beyond traditional global safety mechanisms, and will contribute to the advancement of safety control methods in personalized text-to-image generation. 2. Related Work Safety alignment. The increasing deployment of textto-image (T2I) diffusion models has raised concerns over harmful, biased, or unsafe content (Luccioni et al. 2023; Schramowski et al. 2023; Barez et al. 2025; Zhang et al. 2025). Existing efforts toward safety alignment can be broadly grouped into erasure-based methods, pr"

CellForge, an agentic system using a multi-agent framework, transforms raw single-cell multi-omics data into optimized computational models for virtual cells, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in single-cell perturbation prediction.  					AI-generated summary 				 Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules: Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus. We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction, using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling challenge.

Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct is a cybersecurity-focused LLM designed for chat-style interactions and instruction-following, outperforming other models in cybersecurity tasks while matching their instruction-following capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success across many domains, yet their integration into cybersecurity applications remains limited due to a lack of general-purpose cybersecurity data, representational complexity, and safety and regulatory concerns. To address this gap, we previously introduced Foundation-Sec-8B, a cybersecurity-focused LLM suitable for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. That model, however, was not designed for chat-style interactions or instruction-following. In this report, we release Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct: a model specifically trained for general-purpose cybersecurity dialogue. Built on Foundation-Sec-8B, it combines domain-specific knowledge with instruction-following, conversational capabilities, and alignment with human preferences to produce high-quality, relevant responses. Comprehensive evaluations show that Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct outperforms Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct on a range of cybersecurity tasks while matching its instruction-following performance. It is also competitive with GPT-4o-mini on cyber threat intelligence and instruction-following tasks. We envision Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct becoming an indispensable assistant in the daily workflows of cybersecurity professionals. We release the model publicly at https://huggingface.co/fdtn-ai/Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct.

A personalized safety alignment framework integrates user-specific profiles into text-to-image diffusion models to better align generated content with individual safety preferences.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation, but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process, adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://torpedo2648.github.io/PSAlign/.

InstructVLA is an end-to-end vision-language-action model that enhances manipulation performance while preserving vision-language reasoning through multimodal training and mixture-of-experts adaptation.  					AI-generated summary 				 To operate effectively in the real world, robots must integrate multimodal reasoning with precise action generation. However, existing vision-language-action (VLA) models often sacrifice one for the other, narrow their abilities to task-specific manipulation data, and suffer catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained vision-language capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce InstructVLA, an end-to-end VLA model that preserves the flexible reasoning of large vision-language models (VLMs) while delivering leading manipulation performance. InstructVLA introduces a novel training paradigm, Vision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT), which employs multimodal training with mixture-of-experts adaptation to jointly optimize textual reasoning and action generation on both standard VLM corpora and a curated 650K-sample VLA-IT dataset. On in-domain SimplerEnv tasks, InstructVLA achieves 30.5% improvement over SpatialVLA. To evaluate generalization, we introduce SimplerEnv-Instruct, an 80-task benchmark requiring closed-loop control and high-level instruction understanding, where it outperforms a fine-tuned OpenVLA by 92% and an action expert aided by GPT-4o by 29%. Additionally, InstructVLA surpasses baseline VLMs on multimodal tasks and exhibits inference-time scaling by leveraging textual reasoning to boost manipulation performance in both simulated and real-world settings. These results demonstrate InstructVLA's potential for bridging intuitive and steerable human-robot interaction with efficient policy learning.

"InstructVLA is an end-to-end vision-language-action model that enhances manipulation performance while preserving vision-language reasoning through multimodal training and mixture-of-experts adaptation.  					AI-generated summary 				 To operate effectively in the real world, robots must integrate multimodal reasoning with precise action generation. However, existing vision-language-action (VLA) models often sacrifice one for the other, narrow their abilities to task-specific manipulation data, and suffer catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained vision-language capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce InstructVLA, an end-to-end VLA model that preserves the flexible reasoning of large vision-language models (VLMs) while delivering leading manipulation performance. InstructVLA introduces a novel training paradigm, Vision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT), which employs multimodal training with mixture-of-experts adaptation to jointly optimize textual reasoning and action generation on both standard VLM corpora and a curated 650K-sample VLA-IT dataset. On in-domain SimplerEnv tasks, InstructVLA achieves 30.5% improvement over SpatialVLA. To evaluate generalization, we introduce SimplerEnv-Instruct, an 80-task benchmark requiring closed-loop control and high-level instruction understanding, where it outperforms a fine-tuned OpenVLA by 92% and an action expert aided by GPT-4o by 29%. Additionally, InstructVLA surpasses baseline VLMs on multimodal tasks and exhibits inference-time scaling by leveraging textual reasoning to boost manipulation performance in both simulated and real-world settings. These results demonstrate InstructVLA's potential for bridging intuitive and steerable human-robot interaction with efficient policy learning."

A modular training framework accelerates the development of omni-modal LLMs through efficient 3D parallelism and flexible configuration.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven impressive progress in omni-modal understanding and generation. However, training omni-modal LLMs remains a significant challenge due to the heterogeneous model architectures required to process diverse modalities, necessitating sophisticated system design for efficient large-scale training. Existing frameworks typically entangle model definition with parallel logic, incurring limited scalability and substantial engineering overhead for end-to-end omni-modal training. % We present \veomni, a modular and efficient training framework to accelerate the development of omni-modal LLMs. \veomni introduces model-centric distributed recipes that decouples communication from computation, enabling efficient 3D parallelism on omni-modal LLMs. \veomni also features a flexible configuration interface supporting seamless integration of new modalities with minimal code change. % Using \veomni, a omni-modal mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 30B parameters can be trained with over 2,800 tokens/sec/GPU throughput and scale to 160K context lengths via 3D parallelism on 128 GPUs, showcasing its superior efficiency and scalability for training large omni-modal LLMs.
