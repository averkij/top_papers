Text:"Uncertainty-Based Methods for Automated Process Reward Data Construction and Output Aggregation in Mathematical Reasoning Jiuzhou Han1, Wray Buntine2, Ehsan Shareghi1 1Department of Data Science & AI, Monash University 2College of Engineering and Computer Science, VinUniversity jiuzhou.han@monash.edu, wray.b@vinuni.edu.vn, ehsan.shareghi@monash.edu 5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 3 7 7 1 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r Abstract Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step, thereby effectively improving the models reasoning abilities. However, training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertaintyaware output aggregation methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Jiuzhouh/UnPRM. Inference-time scaling (Lightman et al. 2024) offers practical approach to improving reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging increased computational resources during inference. Within this framework, Process Reward Models (PRMs) (Uesato et al."

An uncertainty-driven framework for automated process reward data construction and aggregation methods improves the effectiveness and efficiency of Process-Level Reward Models in mathematical reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step, thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However, training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Jiuzhouh/UnPRM.
