Text:"Diffusion Models without Classifier-free Guidance Zhicong Tang 1 Jianmin Bao 2 Dong Chen 2 Baining Guo 2 5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 4 5 1 2 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r aThis paper presents Model-guidance (MG), novel objective for training diffusion model that addresses and removes of the commonly used Classifier-free guidance (CFG). Our innovative approach transcends the standard modeling of solely data distribution to incorporating the posterior probability of conditions. The proposed technique originates from the idea of CFG and is easy yet effective, making it plug-and-play module for existing models. Our method significantly accelerates the training process, doubles the inference speed, and achieve exceptional quality that parallel and even surpass concurrent diffusion models with CFG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, scalability on different models and datasets. Finally, we establish state-of-theart performance on ImageNet 256 benchmarks with an FID of 1.34. Our code is available at github.com/tzco/Diffusion-wo-CFG. 1. Introduction Diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021a;b) have become the cornerstone of many successful generative models, e.g. image generation (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Nichol et al., 2022; Rombach et al., 2022; Podell et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024) and video generation (Ho et al., 2022; Blattmann et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2025; Polyak et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024) tasks. However, diffusion models also struggle to generate low temperature samples (Ho & Salimans, 2021; Karras et al., 2024) due to the nature of training objectives, and techniques such as Classifier guidance (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021) and Classifier-free guidance (CFG) (Ho & Salimans, 2021) are proposed to improve performances. Despite its advantage and ubiquity, CFG has several drawbacks (Karras et al., 2024) and poses challenges to effective implementations (Kynkaanniemi et al., 2024) of diffusion 1Tsinghua University 2Microsoft Research Asia. Figure 1: We propose Model-guidance (MG), removing Classifier-free guidance (CFG) for diffusion models and achieving state-of-the-art on ImageNet with FID of 1.34. (a) Instead of running models twice during inference (green and red), MG directly learns the final distribution (blue). (b) MG requires only one line of code modification while providing excellent improvements. (c) Comparing to concurrent methods, MG yields lowest FID even without CFG. models. One critical limitation is the simultaneous training of unconditional model apart from the main diffusion model. The unconditional model is typically implemented by randomly dropping the condition of training pairs and replacing with an manually defined empty label. The introduction of additional tasks may reduce network capabilities and lead to skewed sampling distributions (Karras et al., 2024; Kynkaanniemi et al., 2024). Furthermore, CFG requires two forward passes per denoising step during inference, one for the conditioned and another for the unconditioned model, thereby significantly escalating the computational costs. In this work, we propose Model-guidance (MG), an innovative method for diffusion models to effectively circumvent CFG and boost performances, thereby eliminating the limitations above. We propose novel objective that transcends from simply modeling the data distribution to incorporating the posterior probability of conditions. Specifically, we leverage the model itself as an implicit classifier and directly learn the score of calibrated distribution during training. As depicted in Figure 1, our proposed method confers mul1 Diffusion Models without Classifier-Free Guidance tiple substantial breakthroughs. First, it significantly refines generation quality and accelerates training processes, with experiments showcasing 6.5 convergence speedup than vanilla diffusion models with excellent quality. Second, the inference speed is doubled with our method, as each denoising step needs only one network forward in contrast to two in CFG. Besides, it is easy to implement and requires only one line of code modification, making it plug-and-play module of existing diffusion models with instant improvements. Finally, it is an end-to-end method that excels traditional two-stage distillation-based approaches and even outperforms CFG in generation performances. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the prevalent Imagenet (Deng et al., 2009; Russakovsky et al., 2015) benchmarks with 256256 and 512512 resolution and compare with wide variates of concurrent models to attest the effectiveness of our proposed method. The evaluation results demonstrate that our method not only parallels and even outperforms other approaches with CFG, but also scales to different models and datasets, making it promising enhancement for diffusion models. In conclusion, we make the following contribution in this work: We proposed novel and effective method, Modelguidance (MG), for training diffusion models. MG removes CFG for diffusion models and greatly accelerates both training and inference process. Extensive experiments with SOTA results on ImageNet demonstrate the usefulness and advantages of MG. 2. Background 2.1. Diffusion and Flow Models Diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021a;b) are class of generative models that utilize forward and reverse stochastic processes to model complex data distributions. The forward process adds noise and transforms data samples into Gaussian distributions as q(xtx0) = (cid:0)xt; αtx0, (1 αt)I(cid:1) , (1) where xt represents the noised data at timestep and αt = (cid:81)t s=1 αs is the noise schedule. Conversely, the reverse process learns to denoise and finally recover the original data distribution, which aims to reconstruct score (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song et al., 2021b) from the noisy samples xt by learning pθ(xt1xt) = (xt1; µθ(xt, t), Σθ(xt, t)) , (2) where µθ and Σθ are mean and variance and commonly predicted by neural networks. In common implementations, the training of diffusion mod2 els leverages re-parameterized objective that directly predicts the noise at each step (Ho et al., 2020) Lsimple = Et,x0,ϵϵθ(xt, t) ϵ2, where xt is derived from the forward process in Equation (1) with x0 and ϵ drawn from dataset and Gaussian noises. (3) Conditional diffusion models allow users to generate samples aligned with specified demands and"

This paper presents Model-guidance (MG), a novel objective for training diffusion model that addresses and removes of the commonly used Classifier-free guidance (CFG). Our innovative approach transcends the standard modeling of solely data distribution to incorporating the posterior probability of conditions. The proposed technique originates from the idea of CFG and is easy yet effective, making it a plug-and-play module for existing models. Our method significantly accelerates the training process, doubles the inference speed, and achieve exceptional quality that parallel and even surpass concurrent diffusion models with CFG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, scalability on different models and datasets. Finally, we establish state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet 256 benchmarks with an FID of 1.34. Our code is available at https://github.com/tzco/Diffusion-wo-CFG.
