However, standard Transformers only use representations from the immediately preceding layer. In this paper, we show that this design choice causes representation collapse and leads to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we introduce LayerIntegrated Memory (LIMe), simple yet powerful approach that preserves the models overall memory footprint while expanding its representational capacity by allowing access to hidden states from earlier layers. Through extensive experiments across various architectures and different lookup mechanisms, we demonstrate consistent performance improvements on wide range of tasks. Moreover, our analysis of the learned representation dynamics and our exploration of depthwise circuits reveal how LIMe integrates information across layers, pointing to promising directions for future research. 1. Introduction Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have become central architecture in modern machine learning, powering stateof-the-art solutions in language modeling, computer vision, and beyond. Their ability to capture complex patterns arises from deeply stacked layers that refine contextual representations. However, despite their success, standard Transformer decoders maintain single residual stream per layer, forcing the model to compress all previously learned features into the immediately preceding hidden state (Srivastava et al., 2015; He et al., 2015). This design choice can lead to representation collapse phenomenon in which different tokens or features become indistinguishable in deeper layers (Voita et al., 2019; Barbero et al., 2024; Arefin et al., 2024). The problem is particularly pronounced when learning from *Equal contribution 1T-Tech 2HSE University 3Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Correspondence to: Yaroslav Aksenov <y.o.aksenov@tbank.ru>. Preprint lengthy sequences, where subtle token distinctions risk being squeezed out by limited floating-point precision and finite hidden-state capacity. In this paper, we propose Layer-Integrated Memory1 (LIMe), simple yet powerful extension to masked multihead self-attention that enables the model to retrieve and integrate representations from all earlier layers rather than relying solely on the most recent hidden state. LIMe accomplishes this by learning special routing mechanism that efficiently blends multi-layer features for both keys and values, all while preserving the core Transformer structure and adding negligible overhead. Through extensive language modeling experiments and indepth analysis, we demonstrate three main contributions. First, LIMe consistently outperforms standard Transformer baselines (Grattafiori et al., 2024) and other state-of-the-art modifications (Zhu et al., 2024) across diverse range of one-shot benchmarks. Second, our empirical investigations show that LIMe effectively counters representation collapse: it preserves higher entropy in deeper layers, increases separability for closely related tokens, and improves overall representational diversity. Third, we provide insights into the depthwise circuits LIMe learns, revealing how crucial lexical or syntactic cues from earlier layers are seamlessly reintroduced in later layers. Together, these findings indicate that explicitly integrating multi-layer memory not only enhances performance but also yields richer, more interpretable internal representations. Our results suggest promising direction for building deeper and more robust Transformers. By decoupling the burden of storing all relevant context from the single residual stream, LIMe opens the door to range of architectural advances that harness earlier-layer features more effectively. 2. Related Work Since the works of Srivastava et al. (2015) and He et al. (2015), deep networks have been described as series of modules that sequentially refine residual stream to predict target (i.e., with residual connections). The Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) is no exception. Even modern 1Source code is available by the link https://github.com/corlteam/lime 1 You Do Not Fully Utilize Transformers Representation Capacity 3.1. Attention Mechanism The attention mechanism enables the model to assign different levels of importance to tokens when encoding particular token. Scaled dot-product attention is central to the Transformer model. Given queries Rnd, keys Rnd, and values Rnd, where is the sequence length, the attention function is: Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax (cid:16) QK (cid:17) V. The factor bilizing gradients during training. helps mitigate large dot-product values, staFigure 1. Training loss per FLOPs for Llama, Static LIMe, and Dynamic LIMe. LIMe has substantially lower loss with similar amount of FLOPs. See Section 5.1 for more details. LLMs (Grattafiori et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2023; Qwen et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024) still rely on residual connections and normalizations. Despite the effectiveness of transformers and residual connections, this setup requires storing all the features needed to solve the task in single vector. Tenney et al. (2019) showed that different tasks have different optimal layer indices, while Voita et al. (2019) demonstrated that LMs are particularly vulnerable to representations being squeezed when different tokens appear in similar hidden states. Hahn & Rofin (2024) noted that transformers cannot model sensitive functions for large sequence lengths and Barbero et al. (2024) showed that pretrained models cannot separate long sequences with small changes in hidden state space. These issues are commonly referred to as representation collapse. To address this issue, various approaches to hidden state aggregation have been proposed (Fang et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2021), but these methods are mostly ad hoc and are trained on downstream discriminative tasks. Recently, Zhu et al. (2024) proposed using multiple residual streams that can interact with each other, although this increases the hidden state size of the model. Arefin et al. (2024) introduced additional regularization to prevent representation collapse. 3. Preliminary To prevent the model from accessing future tokens during train"

In this paper, we introduce OctoTools, training-free, user-friendly, and easily extensible open-source agentic framework designed to tackle complex reasoning across diverse domains. OctoTools introduces standardized tool cards to encapsulate tool functionality, planner for both high-level and low-level planning, and an executor to carry out tool usage. We validate OctoTools generality across 16 diverse tasks (including MathVista, MMLU-Pro, MedQA, and GAIA-Text), achieving substantial average accuracy gains of 9.3% over GPT-4o. Furthermore, OctoTools outperforms AutoGen, GPT-Functions and LangChain by up to 10.6% when given the same set of tools. Through comprehensive analysis and ablations, OctoTools demonstrates advantages in task planning, effective tool usage, and multi-step problem solving. Figure 2.

Introduction Large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023b) have made rapid progress on tasks such as summarization, translation (Thoppilan et al., 2022), code generation (Nakano et al., 2021), and math problem solving (Shuster et al., 2022). However, complex reasoning tasks that involve multiple steps, logical decomposition, or specialized domain knowledge remains challenging. For example, solving visual riddle may require fine-grained image understanding and text-based reasoning, while math or chemistry question can require thorough computations or domain expertise. Existing prompting methods often fail to orchestrate these varied processes into coherent chain of reasoning (Yao et al., 2022). promising direction to address these challenges is to augment LLMs with external tools. By offloading specialized subtasks (e.g., web queries, Python-based calculations, and specialized scientific tools) to dedicated modules, LLMs can focus on higher-level planning and synthesis. Several frameworks have explored such tool usage, from those relying on extensive supervised data and fine-tuning (Schick et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), to static solutions without refinement (Lu et al., 2023), and those limited to one specialized domain of tools (Nakano et al., 2021; Tao et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024). Although these methods perform well on specific tasks, they still face challenges that hinder general widespread use. Many require substantial training with curated data, which limits their adaptability to new domains. Others are designed for particular domain (Bran et al., 2023; Kang & Kim, 2024; Li et al., 2024a; Schmidgall et al., 2024) or cannot easily support multi-step problemsolving (Lu et al., 2023), restricting their generality. In this paper, we propose OctoTools, training-free (i.e., it does not require updating model weights), user-friendly, and extensible agentic framework for tackling complex reasoning tasks across diverse domains (Figure 1). key feature of OctoTools is the concept of tool cards, standardized wrappers that encapsulate heterogeneous tools (e.g., Python calculators, web search APIs, and domain-specific modules), along with metadata such as input-output formats, usage constraints, and best practices that delineate ideal use cases. This standardized design enables easy integration, replacement, or expansion of toolsunlike approaches requiring painstaking re-engineering for each new tool (Lu et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024). Building on these tool cards, OctoTools employs dedicated planner that governs both high-level and low-level planning. Given user query, the planner proposes tentative global plan for how various tools might be employed. At each step, it generates text-based action (including sub-goals and tool selection) conditioned on the evolving context. separate executor instantiates tool calls by converting this textual action into an executable command, running the corresponding tool, and updating the context with the results. By separating strategic planning from command generation, OctoTools reduces errors and increases transparency, making the system more reliable and easier to maintain. An additional challenge in agentic systems is determining which subset of tools to enable for given domain. Although providing many tools can be beneficial, enabling them all may introduce noise or slow performance (Lumer, 2024; Fore et al., 2024; Paramanayakam et al., 2024).

In contrast to RNNs, which compress previous tokens into a single hidden state, Transformers can attend to all previous tokens directly. However, standard Transformers only use representations from the immediately preceding layer. In this paper, we show that this design choice causes representation collapse and leads to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we introduce Layer-Integrated Memory (LIMe), a simple yet powerful approach that preserves the model's overall memory footprint while expanding its representational capacity by allowing access to hidden states from earlier layers. Through extensive experiments across various architectures and different lookup mechanisms, we demonstrate consistent performance improvements on a wide range of tasks. Moreover, our analysis of the learned representation dynamics and our exploration of depthwise circuits reveal how LIMe integrates information across layers, pointing to promising directions for future research.

Solving complex reasoning tasks may involve visual understanding, domain knowledge retrieval, numerical calculation, and multi-step reasoning. Existing methods augment large language models (LLMs) with external tools but are restricted to specialized domains, limited tool types, or require additional training data. In this paper, we introduce OctoTools, a training-free, user-friendly, and easily extensible open-source agentic framework designed to tackle complex reasoning across diverse domains. OctoTools introduces standardized tool cards to encapsulate tool functionality, a planner for both high-level and low-level planning, and an executor to carry out tool usage. We validate OctoTools' generality across 16 diverse tasks (including MathVista, MMLU-Pro, MedQA, and GAIA-Text), achieving substantial average accuracy gains of 9.3% over GPT-4o. Furthermore, OctoTools outperforms AutoGen, GPT-Functions and LangChain by up to 10.6% when given the same set of tools. Through comprehensive analysis and ablations, OctoTools demonstrates advantages in task planning, effective tool usage, and multi-step problem solving.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various tasks such as natural language understanding, text summarization, and machine translation. However, their general-purpose nature often limits their effectiveness in domain-specific applications that require specialized knowledge, such as healthcare, chemistry, or legal analysis. To address this, researchers have explored diverse methods to enhance LLMs by integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of these methods, which we categorize into four key approaches: dynamic knowledge injection, static knowledge embedding, modular adapters, and prompt optimization. Each approach offers unique mechanisms to equip LLMs with domain expertise, balancing trade-offs between flexibility, scalability, and efficiency. We discuss how these methods enable LLMs to tackle specialized tasks, compare their advantages and disadvantages, evaluate domain-specific LLMs against general LLMs, and highlight the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field. For those interested in delving deeper into this area, we also summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks. To keep researchers updated on the latest studies, we maintain an open-source at: https://github.com/abilliyb/Knowledge_Injection_Survey_Papers, dedicated to documenting research in the field of specialized LLM.

The rapid advancement of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has led to an exponential growth in research publications, creating an urgent need for efficient knowledge management and reasoning systems in this domain. We present a comprehensive knowledge-enhanced system for PSCs that integrates three key components. First, we develop Perovskite-KG, a domain-specific knowledge graph constructed from 1,517 research papers, containing 23,789 entities and 22,272 relationships. Second, we create two complementary datasets: Perovskite-Chat, comprising 55,101 high-quality question-answer pairs generated through a novel multi-agent framework, and Perovskite-Reasoning, containing 2,217 carefully curated materials science problems. Third, we introduce two specialized large language models: Perovskite-Chat-LLM for domain-specific knowledge assistance and Perovskite-Reasoning-LLM for scientific reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms existing models in both domain-specific knowledge retrieval and scientific reasoning tasks, providing researchers with effective tools for literature review, experimental design, and complex problem-solving in PSC research.
