[ 1 2 4 1 3 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r aFoundation models pre-trained on massive unlabeled datasets have revolutionized natural language and computer vision, exhibiting remarkable generalization capabilities, thus highlighting the importance of pre-training. Yet, efforts in robotics have struggled to achieve similar success, limited by either the need for costly robotic annotations or the lack of representations that effectively model the physical world. In this paper, we introduce ARM4R, an Auto-regressive Robotic Model that leverages low-level 4D Representations learned from human video data to yield better pretrained robotic model. Specifically, we focus on utilizing 3D point tracking representations from videos derived by lifting 2D representations into 3D space via monocular depth estimation across time. These 4D representations maintain shared geometric structure between the points and robot state representations up to linear transformation, enabling efficient transfer learning from human video data to low-level robotic control. Our experiments show that ARM4R can transfer efficiently from human video data to robotics and consistently improves performance on tasks across various robot environments and configurations. 1. Introduction Recently, foundation models (FMs) have shown remarkable success, particularly in the domains of language (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023), vision (Kirillov et al., 2023), and multi-modal models (Chen et al., 2022; Alayrac et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023) pre-trained on vast amounts of vision and text data. These models exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities (Radford et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2021; Chung et al., 2024), highlighting the power of pre-training on generic data. However, numerous attempts in robotics (Xiao et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2024; Zhen et al., 1BAIR, UC Berkeley. *Equal contribution. Equal advising. 1 2024b; Niu et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024) have yet to achieve the same pre-training success seen in other domains. This could potentially be attributed to the scarcity of large-scale, diverse robotic data, unlike the abundance of text and image data available for vision and language FMs. The lack of robotic data poses significant bottleneck in training foundation models that can effectively generalize across diverse robotic platforms and tasks. To overcome this limitation, several recent approaches (Xiao et al., 2022; Ye et al., 2024) employ representation learning by pre-training on an abundance of human data, enabling transfer to robotic systems. These approaches aim to recognize the inherent similarities between human and robot manipulation tasks and exploit the vast repositories of human video data available on the internet. Yet, these approaches have not been able to demonstrate effective generalization to downstream tasks. In part, this is due to their representations lacking an understanding of the physical world (Zhen et al., 2024a), and therefore being less effective for robotics. In contrast with these methods, Vision-Language-Action (VLAs) models take slightly different approach, implicitly leveraging human data in robotics by incorporating pre-trained components from Vision-and-Language Models In particular, they use language decoders pre- (VLMs). trained on tasks like visual question answering (e.g., RT2 (Brohan et al., 2023a)) and image captioning (e.g., OpenVLA (Kim et al., 2024)). Despite such efforts, there is discrepancy between these models high-level pre-training objective and the goal of enabling robotic models to handle low-level action prediction. While these initial objectives are valuable for comprehending visual and linguistic content, they dont directly address the nuances of low-level robot control, which involves aspects like precise manipulation and spatial reasoning. To address this, this papers method employs lower-level pre-training objective by starting with model that utilizes next-token prediction to learn 4D representations from human video data. These representations can then be transferred to more specialized scenarios by finetuning on robotic scenes and subsequently on proprioceptive data, while maintaining the same training objective. In this paper, we introduce ARM4R (Auto-regressive Pre-training Auto-regressive Robotic Models with 4D Representations Figure 1: Overview of ARM4R. We introduce an Auto-regressive Robotic Model that leverages low-level 4D Representations (3D point tracks across time) learned from human videos to yield better pre-trained robotic model. Robotic Model with 4D Representations).1 The key insight behind ARM4R is to learn low-level representation from the abundance of human video data that can capture properties of the physical world. This involves lifting 2D representations to 3D using monocular depth estimation and subsequently tracking the 3D points. The resulting 4D representations maintain shared geometric structure up to linear transformation between the 3D points and robot state representations used downstream, enabling efficient transfer learning from human video data to robotic manipulation tasks. Surprisingly, pre-training our method solely on human data yields superior results compared to other models like VLAs (Kim et al., 2024) that are pre-trained on robotic data such as OpenX (Collaboration et al., 2023). We summarize our main contributions as follows: (i) We introduce novel robotics pre-training approach that incorporates low-level 4D representations that enhance understanding of the physical world while also learning from unlabeled videos. (ii) Our approach shows that pre-training solely on human video data can lead to better performance than other methods that are pre-trained only on robotic data; (iii) Our method on average surpasses baselines like PerAct (Shridhar et al., 2023) on 12 different tasks in RLBenchs simulated environment, and OpenVLA (Kim et al., 2024) on real tasks with 7-DoF Kinova Gen3 robot; (iv) Our model also exhibits several advantageous properties, 1ARM4R is pronounced armor. including cross-robot generalization and 3D point track prediction for out-of-domain human and robotic videos. 2.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) adapt well to downstream tasks after fine-tuning, this adaptability often compromises prompt robustness, as even minor prompt variations can significantly degrade performance. To address this, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Fine-Tuning(PAFT), a simple yet effective approach that dynamically adjusts prompts during fine-tuning. This encourages the model to learn underlying task principles rather than overfitting to specific prompt formulations. PAFT operates in two stages: First, a diverse set of meaningful, synthetic candidate prompts is constructed. Second, during fine-tuning, prompts are randomly sampled from this set to create dynamic training inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that models trained with PAFT exhibit strong robustness and generalization across a wide range of prompts, including unseen ones. This enhanced robustness improves both model performance and inference speed while maintaining training efficiency. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of PAFT.

Foundation models pre-trained on massive unlabeled datasets have revolutionized natural language and computer vision, exhibiting remarkable generalization capabilities, thus highlighting the importance of pre-training. Yet, efforts in robotics have struggled to achieve similar success, limited by either the need for costly robotic annotations or the lack of representations that effectively model the physical world. In this paper, we introduce ARM4R, an Auto-regressive Robotic Model that leverages low-level 4D Representations learned from human video data to yield a better pre-trained robotic model. Specifically, we focus on utilizing 3D point tracking representations from videos derived by lifting 2D representations into 3D space via monocular depth estimation across time. These 4D representations maintain a shared geometric structure between the points and robot state representations up to a linear transformation, enabling efficient transfer learning from human video data to low-level robotic control. Our experiments show that ARM4R can transfer efficiently from human video data to robotics and consistently improves performance on tasks across various robot environments and configurations.
