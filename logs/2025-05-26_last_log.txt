All rights reserved V-Triune: Visual Triple Unified Reinforcement Learning 1. Introduction The recent advancement of large language models (LLMs) (Guo et al., 2025; Jaech et al., 2024) and visual-language models (VLMs) (Google DeepMind, 2025; OpenAI, 2025) has seen paradigm shift from pre-training scaling to test-time scaling. key manifestation of this shift is the practice of extending context length for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, which significantly enhances performance on complex tasks such as mathematics and coding (Guo et al., 2025; Xia et al., 2025). While reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as promising method for post-training VLMs, current research remains limited (Li et al., 2025a; Liu et al., 2025d,e; Ma et al., 2025a; Shen et al., 2025; Tan et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b; Yang et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025a). Most prior work has focused on narrow task domainstypically visual reasoning tasks like math QA and Science QA (Huang et al., 2025; Meng et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025), where the RL setup closely mirrors RL training paradigms in LLMs. Moreover, existing works (Liu et al., 2025a,c) remain an open question whether RL can be effectively scaled to visual perception tasks such as object detection and grounding, which require distinct reward design and measures to ensure training stability. We introduce V-Triune (Visual Triple Unified Reinforcement Learning), the first unified RL system for post-training VLMs on both visual reasoning and perception tasks. V-Triune integrates three complementary components, each operating at distinct level for this unification: Sample-Level Data Formatting (detailed in Sec. 3.1) handles diverse task and reward needs by allowing each sample to define its reward setup and chosen verifier. Verifier-Level Reward Computation (Sec. 3.2) offers key modularity and task-adaptability by assigning reward generation to specialized verifiers for specific task groups. Lastly, Source-Level Metric Monitoring (Sec. 3.3) provides essential tracking and diagnostics by logging metrics per data source, vital for spotting data issues and ensuring stable multi-task, multi-source learning. Beyond these core components, key innovation in V-Triune is the Dynamic IoU reward (Sec. 3.4). This mechanism targets visual perception tasks like object detection and grounding, addressing issues with fixed IoU thresholds. By progressively adjusting the IoU reward threshold (from relaxed to stricter criteria), it ensures useful early learning signals, guides the model towards high-precision results, and ultimately enables stable, scalable training procedure. Leveraging the V-Triune system, we develop the Orsta model series, featuring variants with sizes ranging from 7B to 32B, built upon the Qwen2.5-VL family of baselines. These models undergo joint optimization across diverse set of tasks, spanning visual reasoning (mathematics, science, chart, puzzle) and visual perception (object detection, grounding, OCR, counting). On the comprehensive MEGA-Bench core benchmark (Chen et al., 2024), which covers over 400 real-world visual tasks, Orsta demonstrates substantial performance gains. These improvements range from +2.1% up to an impressive +14.1% across its various 7B and 32B model variants. These performance benefits extend to prominent downstream benchmarks (including MMMU, MathVista, COCO, and CountBench), validating V-Triunes effectiveness and scalability. Our core contributions are: We introduce V-Triune, the first unified, scalable, and extensible RL system designed for jointly training VLMs on both visual reasoning and perception tasks within single paradigm. We propose the Dynamic IoU Reward, novel, adaptive reward mechanism that significantly enhances stability and performance for visual perception tasks like detection and grounding. We establish and demonstrate comprehensive training methodology, including key engineering optimizations, enabling effective and stable RL training across eight diverse VLM tasks spanning both reasoning and perception. We present Orsta, family of high-performance models (7B-32B) trained with V-Triune, achieving substantial gains (up to +14.1%) on the MEGA-Bench "

Text:"Department of Electrical Engineering Stanford University Stanford, CA, USA 5 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 1 9 0 7 1 . 5 0 5 2 : r Fig. 1: Overview of our method. We replace ViT/Audio-Transformer with text-LLM enabling them to see and hear using learned circuits just by reading text. AbstractThis paper presents fascinating find: By training an autoregressive LLM model on text tokens, the text model inherently develops internally an ability to understand images and audio, thereby developing the ability to see and hear just by reading. Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various applications rather than training models from scratch every single time. 1. INTRODUCTION Large Language Models (LLM) have had profound impact on AI by pushing the frontier of problems and things that computers can do that were unimaginable even 3-4 years back, e.g. winning medal in International Math Olympiad [1]. This has led to almost every single approach in variety of domains such as natural language processing [2], acoustic tokens [3], raw audio [4], vision [5], robotics [6] converging on GPT like pipeline. This approach is: the modality of interest is tokenized, and GPT architecture is trained to predict the next token. If necessary, the modality of interest is reconstructed from the tokens predicted by the GPT-based LLM in the specific domain of interest. Post-training methods such as test t"

Text:"5 2 0 2 3 2 ] . [ 1 8 0 5 7 1 . 5 0 5 2 : r On the Design of KL-Regularized Policy Gradient Algorithms for LLM Reasoning Yifan Zhang* 1 Yifeng Liu* 1 Huizhuo Yuan1 Yang Yuan2,3 Quanquan Gu1 Andrew Yao2,3 1University of California, Los Angeles 2IIIS, Tsinghua University 3Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute Abstract Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the widespread use of Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization in policy gradient algorithms to stabilize training, the systematic exploration of how different KL divergence formulations can be estimated and integrated into surrogate loss functions for online reinforcement learning (RL) presents nuanced and systematically explorable design space. In this paper, we propose Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG), systematic framework for deriving and analyzing KL-regularized policy gradient methods in the online RL setting. We derive policy gradients and corresponding surrogate loss functions for objectives regularized by both forward and reverse KL divergences, considering both normalized and unnormalized policy distributions. Furthermore, we present derivations for fully differentiable loss functions as well as REINFORCE-style gradient estimators, accommodating diverse algorithmic needs. We conduct extensive experiments on RL for LLM reasoning using these methods, showing improved or competitive results in terms of training stability and performance compared to strong baselines such as GRPO, REINFORCE++, and DAPO. The code is available at https://github.com/complex-reasoning/RPG. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly policy gradient (PG) methods, provides powerful framework for solving sequential decision-making problems in complex environments. These methods have been successfully applied in diverse domains, ranging from robotics to game playing, and have recently become instrumental in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to align"

Agent Distillation transfers reasoning and task-solving capabilities from large language models to smaller models using enhanced prompts and self-consistent actions, matching performance of larger models on various reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain computationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into smaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher LLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual knowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited capability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for transferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from LLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small as 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier larger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the potential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small agents.

The use of carefully crafted hallucinations in a curriculum learning approach within the DPO alignment procedure significantly enhances LLMs' hallucination detection abilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Aligning large language models (LLMs) to accurately detect hallucinations remains a significant challenge due to the sophisticated nature of hallucinated text. Recognizing that hallucinated samples typically exhibit higher deceptive quality than traditional negative samples, we use these carefully engineered hallucinations as negative examples in the DPO alignment procedure. Our method incorporates a curriculum learning strategy, gradually transitioning the training from easier samples, identified based on the greatest reduction in probability scores from independent fact checking models, to progressively harder ones. This structured difficulty scaling ensures stable and incremental learning. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our HaluCheck models, trained with curriculum DPO approach and high quality negative samples, significantly improves model performance across various metrics, achieving improvements of upto 24% on difficult benchmarks like MedHallu and HaluEval. Additionally, HaluCheck models demonstrate robustness in zero-shot settings, significantly outperforming larger state-of-the-art models across various benchmarks.

CANOE improves LLM faithfulness in generation tasks using synthetic QA data and Dual-GRPO reinforcement learning without human annotations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Teaching large language models (LLMs) to be faithful in the provided context is crucial for building reliable information-seeking systems. Therefore, we propose a systematic framework, CANOE, to improve the faithfulness of LLMs in both short-form and long-form generation tasks without human annotations. Specifically, we first synthesize short-form question-answering (QA) data with four diverse tasks to construct high-quality and easily verifiable training data without human annotation. Also, we propose Dual-GRPO, a rule-based reinforcement learning method that includes three tailored rule-based rewards derived from synthesized short-form QA data, while simultaneously optimizing both short-form and long-form response generation. Notably, Dual-GRPO eliminates the need to manually label preference data to train reward models and avoids over-optimizing short-form generation when relying only on the synthesized short-form QA data. Experimental results show that CANOE greatly improves the faithfulness of LLMs across 11 different downstream tasks, even outperforming the most advanced LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o and OpenAI o1.

VeriThinker reduces the length of complex reasoning chains in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by fine-tuning them on a verification task, thereby decreasing inference costs without significantly sacrificing accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex tasks using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, their tendency to overthinking leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains, dramatically increasing inference costs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriThinker, a novel approach for CoT compression. Unlike conventional methods that fine-tune LRMs directly on the original reasoning task using synthetic concise CoT data, we innovatively fine-tune the model solely through an auxiliary verification task. By training LRMs to accurately verify the correctness of CoT solutions, the LRMs inherently become more discerning about the necessity of subsequent self-reflection steps, thereby effectively suppressing overthinking. Extensive experiments validate that VeriThinker substantially reduces reasoning chain lengths while maintaining or even slightly improving accuracy. When applied to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, our approach reduces reasoning tokens on MATH500 from 3790 to 2125 while improving accuracy by 0.8% (94.0% to 94.8%), and on AIME25, tokens decrease from 14321 to 10287 with a 2.1% accuracy gain (38.7% to 40.8%). Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that VeriThinker can also be zero-shot generalized to speculative reasoning. Code is available at https://github.com/czg1225/VeriThinker

VLMs are more vulnerable to harmful meme-based prompts than to synthetic images, and while multi-turn interactions offer some protection, significant vulnerabilities remain.  					AI-generated summary 				 Rapid deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) magnifies safety risks, yet most evaluations rely on artificial images. This study asks: How safe are current VLMs when confronted with meme images that ordinary users share? To investigate this question, we introduce MemeSafetyBench, a 50,430-instance benchmark pairing real meme images with both harmful and benign instructions. Using a comprehensive safety taxonomy and LLM-based instruction generation, we assess multiple VLMs across single and multi-turn interactions. We investigate how real-world memes influence harmful outputs, the mitigating effects of conversational context, and the relationship between model scale and safety metrics. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs show greater vulnerability to meme-based harmful prompts than to synthetic or typographic images. Memes significantly increase harmful responses and decrease refusals compared to text-only inputs. Though multi-turn interactions provide partial mitigation, elevated vulnerability persists. These results highlight the need for ecologically valid evaluations and stronger safety mechanisms.

"VLMs are more vulnerable to harmful meme-based prompts than to synthetic images, and while multi-turn interactions offer some protection, significant vulnerabilities remain.  					AI-generated summary 				 Rapid deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) magnifies safety risks, yet most evaluations rely on artificial images. This study asks: How safe are current VLMs when confronted with meme images that ordinary users share? To investigate this question, we introduce MemeSafetyBench, a 50,430-instance benchmark pairing real meme images with both harmful and benign instructions. Using a comprehensive safety taxonomy and LLM-based instruction generation, we assess multiple VLMs across single and multi-turn interactions. We investigate how real-world memes influence harmful outputs, the mitigating effects of conversational context, and the relationship between model scale and safety metrics. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs show greater vulnerability to meme-based harmful prompts than to synthetic or typographic images. Memes significantly increase harmful responses and decrease refusals compared to text-only inputs. Though multi-turn interactions provide partial mitigation, elevated vulnerability persists. These results highlight the need for ecologically valid evaluations and stronger safety mechanisms."

A unified reinforcement learning system, V-Triune, combines visual reasoning and perception tasks in vision-language models through a single training pipeline, achieving significant improvements across various tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the use of RL beyond reasoning tasks remains largely unexplored, especially for perceptionintensive tasks like object detection and grounding. We propose V-Triune, a Visual Triple Unified Reinforcement Learning system that enables VLMs to jointly learn visual reasoning and perception tasks within a single training pipeline. V-Triune comprises triple complementary components: Sample-Level Data Formatting (to unify diverse task inputs), Verifier-Level Reward Computation (to deliver custom rewards via specialized verifiers) , and Source-Level Metric Monitoring (to diagnose problems at the data-source level). We further introduce a novel Dynamic IoU reward, which provides adaptive, progressive, and definite feedback for perception tasks handled by V-Triune. Our approach is instantiated within off-the-shelf RL training framework using open-source 7B and 32B backbone models. The resulting model, dubbed Orsta (One RL to See Them All), demonstrates consistent improvements across both reasoning and perception tasks. This broad capability is significantly shaped by its training on a diverse dataset, constructed around four representative visual reasoning tasks (Math, Puzzle, Chart, and Science) and four visual perception tasks (Grounding, Detection, Counting, and OCR). Subsequently, Orsta achieves substantial gains on MEGA-Bench Core, with improvements ranging from +2.1 to an impressive +14.1 across its various 7B and 32B model variants, with performance benefits extending to a wide range of downstream tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of our unified RL approach for VLMs. The V-Triune system, along with the Orsta models, is publicly available at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI.

ANSE enhances video diffusion models by selecting noise seeds based on model confidence, improving video quality and temporal coherence with minimal increase in inference time.  					AI-generated summary 				 The choice of initial noise significantly affects the quality and prompt alignment of video diffusion models, where different noise seeds for the same prompt can lead to drastically different generations. While recent methods rely on externally designed priors such as frequency filters or inter-frame smoothing, they often overlook internal model signals that indicate which noise seeds are inherently preferable. To address this, we propose ANSE (Active Noise Selection for Generation), a model-aware framework that selects high-quality noise seeds by quantifying attention-based uncertainty. At its core is BANSA (Bayesian Active Noise Selection via Attention), an acquisition function that measures entropy disagreement across multiple stochastic attention samples to estimate model confidence and consistency. For efficient inference-time deployment, we introduce a Bernoulli-masked approximation of BANSA that enables score estimation using a single diffusion step and a subset of attention layers. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B and 5B demonstrate that ANSE improves video quality and temporal coherence with only an 8% and 13% increase in inference time, respectively, providing a principled and generalizable approach to noise selection in video diffusion.

"ANSE enhances video diffusion models by selecting noise seeds based on model confidence, improving video quality and temporal coherence with minimal increase in inference time.  					AI-generated summary 				 The choice of initial noise significantly affects the quality and prompt alignment of video diffusion models, where different noise seeds for the same prompt can lead to drastically different generations. While recent methods rely on externally designed priors such as frequency filters or inter-frame smoothing, they often overlook internal model signals that indicate which noise seeds are inherently preferable. To address this, we propose ANSE (Active Noise Selection for Generation), a model-aware framework that selects high-quality noise seeds by quantifying attention-based uncertainty. At its core is BANSA (Bayesian Active Noise Selection via Attention), an acquisition function that measures entropy disagreement across multiple stochastic attention samples to estimate model confidence and consistency. For efficient inference-time deployment, we introduce a Bernoulli-masked approximation of BANSA that enables score estimation using a single diffusion step and a subset of attention layers. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B and 5B demonstrate that ANSE improves video quality and temporal coherence with only an 8% and 13% increase in inference time, respectively, providing a principled and generalizable approach to noise selection in video diffusion.

Auto-regressive text LLMs trained on text can develop internal capabilities for understanding images and audio, enabling them to perform classification tasks across different modalities without fine-tuning.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents a fascinating find: By training an auto-regressive LLM model on text tokens, the text model inherently develops internally an ability to understand images and audio, thereby developing the ability to see and hear just by reading. Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.

A regularized policy gradient framework is introduced to explore KL divergence formulations for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in online reinforcement learning, demonstrating improved training stability and performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the widespread use of Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization in policy gradient algorithms to stabilize training, the systematic exploration of how different KL divergence formulations can be estimated and integrated into surrogate loss functions for online reinforcement learning (RL) presents a nuanced and systematically explorable design space. In this paper, we propose regularized policy gradient (RPG), a systematic framework for deriving and analyzing KL-regularized policy gradient methods in the online RL setting. We derive policy gradients and corresponding surrogate loss functions for objectives regularized by both forward and reverse KL divergences, considering both normalized and unnormalized policy distributions. Furthermore, we present derivations for fully differentiable loss functions as well as REINFORCE-style gradient estimators, accommodating diverse algorithmic needs. We conduct extensive experiments on RL for LLM reasoning using these methods, showing improved or competitive results in terms of training stability and performance compared to strong baselines such as GRPO, REINFORCE++, and DAPO.

The rapid growth of voice assistants powered by large language models (LLM) has highlighted a need for speech instruction data to train these systems. Despite the abundance of speech recognition data, there is a notable scarcity of speech instruction data, which is essential for fine-tuning models to understand and execute spoken commands. Generating high-quality synthetic speech requires a good text-to-speech (TTS) model, which may not be available to low resource languages. Our novel approach addresses this challenge by halting synthesis at the semantic representation level, bypassing the need for TTS. We achieve this by aligning synthetic semantic representations with the pre-trained Whisper encoder, enabling an LLM to be fine-tuned on text instructions while maintaining the ability to understand spoken instructions during inference. This simplified training process is a promising approach to building voice assistant for low-resource languages.

"The rapid growth of voice assistants powered by large language models (LLM) has highlighted a need for speech instruction data to train these systems. Despite the abundance of speech recognition data, there is a notable scarcity of speech instruction data, which is essential for fine-tuning models to understand and execute spoken commands. Generating high-quality synthetic speech requires a good text-to-speech (TTS) model, which may not be available to low resource languages. Our novel approach addresses this challenge by halting synthesis at the semantic representation level, bypassing the need for TTS. We achieve this by aligning synthetic semantic representations with the pre-trained Whisper encoder, enabling an LLM to be fine-tuned on text instructions while maintaining the ability to understand spoken instructions during inference. This simplified training process is a promising approach to building voice assistant for low-resource languages."

A diagnostic set examines and categorizes reasoning rigidity in large language models, identifying patterns where models ignore instructions and default to familiar reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in long and complex reasoning tasks. However, they frequently exhibit a problematic reliance on familiar reasoning patterns, a phenomenon we term reasoning rigidity. Despite explicit instructions from users, these models often override clearly stated conditions and default to habitual reasoning trajectories, leading to incorrect conclusions. This behavior presents significant challenges, particularly in domains such as mathematics and logic puzzle, where precise adherence to specified constraints is critical. To systematically investigate reasoning rigidity, a behavior largely unexplored in prior work, we introduce a expert-curated diagnostic set, . Our dataset includes specially modified variants of existing mathematical benchmarks, namely AIME and MATH500, as well as well-known puzzles deliberately redesigned to require deviation from familiar reasoning strategies. Using this dataset, we identify recurring contamination patterns that occur when models default to ingrained reasoning. Specifically, we categorize this contamination into three distinctive modes: (i) Interpretation Overload, (ii) Input Distrust, and (iii) Partial Instruction Attention, each causing models to ignore or distort provided instructions. We publicly release our diagnostic set to facilitate future research on mitigating reasoning rigidity in language models.

The Transformer Copilot framework enhances large language model performance through a Copilot model that refines the Pilot's logits based on a Mistake Log, leading to consistent performance improvements across various benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models are typically adapted to downstream tasks through supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific data. While standard fine-tuning focuses on minimizing generation loss to optimize model parameters, we take a deeper step by retaining and leveraging the model's own learning signals, analogous to how human learners reflect on past mistakes to improve future performance. We first introduce the concept of Mistake Log to systematically track the model's learning behavior and recurring errors throughout fine-tuning. Treating the original transformer-based model as the Pilot, we correspondingly design a Copilot model to refine the Pilot's inference performance via logits rectification. We name the overall Pilot-Copilot framework the Transformer Copilot, which introduces (i) a novel Copilot model design, (ii) a joint training paradigm where the Copilot continuously learns from the evolving Mistake Log alongside the Pilot, and (iii) a fused inference paradigm where the Copilot rectifies the Pilot's logits for enhanced generation. We provide both theoretical and empirical analyses on our new learning framework. Experiments on 12 benchmarks spanning commonsense, arithmetic, and recommendation tasks demonstrate that Transformer Copilot consistently improves performance by up to 34.5%, while introducing marginal computational overhead to Pilot models and exhibiting strong scalability and transferability.
