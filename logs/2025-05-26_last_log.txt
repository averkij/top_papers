[ 1 2 5 5 7 1 . 5 0 5 2 : r aDe novo peptide sequencing is critical task in proteomics. However, the performance of current deep learning-based methods is limited by the inherent complexity of mass spectrometry data and the heterogeneous distribution of noise signals, leading to data-specific biases. We present RankNovo, the first deep reranking framework that enhances de novo peptide sequencing by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple sequencing models. RankNovo employs listwise reranking approach, modeling candidate peptides as multiple sequence alignments and utilizing axial attention to extract informative features across candidates. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics, PMD (Peptide Mass Deviation) and RMD (Residual Mass Deviation), which offer delicate supervision by quantifying mass differences between peptides at both the sequence and residue levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RankNovo not only surpasses its base models used to generate training candidates for reranking pre-training, but also sets new state-ofthe-art benchmark. Moreover, RankNovo exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen modelsthose whose generations were not exposed during training, highlighting its robustness and potential as universal reranking framework for peptide sequencing. Our work presents novel reranking strategy that fundamentally challenges existing single-model paradigms and advances the frontier of accurate de novo sequencing.

(A) De Novo Peptide Sequencing Workflow Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry: Our objective is to predict peptide sequences from MS/MS spectra, as illustrated in the final two steps. (B) Motivation for RankNovo: Current de novo peptide sequencing models exhibit data preference in their peptide predictions. RankNovo improves overall prediction accuracy by reranking the outputs of these models to identify the optimal sequence. 1. Introduction Identifying proteins is critical task in proteomics, with mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics being widely regarded as the predominant technique for this purpose (Aebersold & Mann, 2003). As shown in Figure 1, this process begins with the enzymatic digestion of proteins into smaller peptide fragments, which are then analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to generate spectra (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003). These spectra are subsequently interpreted to infer peptide sequences, enabling precise identification and characterization of proteins. This foundational approach is pivotal for advancing research in proteomics (Aebersold & Mann, 2003). Proteomics utilizes two primary methodologies for peptide sequence identification: database searching (Ma et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2020; Leprevost et al., 2014; Shteynberg et al., 2011; Chi et al., 2018) and de novo sequencing (Danˇcık et al., 1999; Chi et al., 2013). In database searching, experimental spectra are matched against pre-existing entries in protein databases to identify the most likely sequences. Although effective for identifying known peptides, this approach is inherently constrained by the completeness of the database, posing challenges when encountering novel RankNovo: Universal Reranking Approach for Robust De Novo Peptide Sequencing or uncharacterized sequences (Karunratanakul et al., 2019; Hettich et al., 2013). On the other hand, de novo sequencing leverages the intrinsic patterns of tandem mass spectra to directly infer peptide sequences without requiring reference database, enabling the discovery of novel peptides. Consequently, de novo sequencing has emerged as critical technique for peptide identification, significantly advancing the scope of proteomic analysis (Ng et al., 2023). Over the past two decades, de novo sequencing has made substantial progress, evolving from graph-theoretic and dynamic programming-based methods to more sophisticated approaches driven by deep learning (Ma et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2022; LeCun et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2025a; Gao et al., 2023). DeepNovo (Tran et al., 2017) was the first to apply deep learning to de novo sequencing, which inspired series of subsequent models(Zhou et al., 2017; Karunratanakul et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2023). More recently, Transformer architectures have been introduced to model de novo sequencing as machine translation task (Yilmaz et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024b; Mao et al., 2023; Eloff et al., 2023a; Yang et al., 2024b; Xia et al., 2024a). Building upon this foundation, ContraNovo (Jin et al., 2024) further advanced the field by incorporating multimodal alignment strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Despite recent advancements in de novo peptide sequencing, these methods still exhibit notable accuracy limitations compared to traditional database search approaches (Muth et al., 2018). The primary challenge stems from the inherent complexity of mass spectrometry data, which consists of mixture of heterogeneous distributions. This complexity is driven by variations in experimental conditions, such as differences in instrumentation, protocols, and target protein species, each of which introduces distinct noise patterns into the acquired spectra (Zubarev & Mann, 2007; Chang et al., 2016). As shown in Fig. 1(B), no model is exempt from issues of generalization and preferential bias, as evidenced by the presence of unique correct predictions from models that otherwise exhibit weaker overall performance. This observation motivates rethinking of de novo peptide sequencing as reranking task, where trained meta-model selects the optimal prediction from collection of outputs generated by multiple de novo models. In this paper, we introduce RankNovo, novel deep reranking framework designed to address the preferential bias challenges inherent in peptide sequencing. In such complex task, peptide candi"

RankNovo is a deep reranking framework that enhances de novo peptide sequencing using multiple models and axial attention, achieving superior performance and generalization.  					AI-generated summary 				 De novo peptide sequencing is a critical task in proteomics. However, the performance of current deep learning-based methods is limited by the inherent complexity of mass spectrometry data and the heterogeneous distribution of noise signals, leading to data-specific biases. We present RankNovo, the first deep reranking framework that enhances de novo peptide sequencing by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple sequencing models. RankNovo employs a list-wise reranking approach, modeling candidate peptides as multiple sequence alignments and utilizing axial attention to extract informative features across candidates. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics, PMD (Peptide Mass Deviation) and RMD (residual Mass Deviation), which offer delicate supervision by quantifying mass differences between peptides at both the sequence and residue levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RankNovo not only surpasses its base models used to generate training candidates for reranking pre-training, but also sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark. Moreover, RankNovo exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen models whose generations were not exposed during training, highlighting its robustness and potential as a universal reranking framework for peptide sequencing. Our work presents a novel reranking strategy that fundamentally challenges existing single-model paradigms and advances the frontier of accurate de novo sequencing.
