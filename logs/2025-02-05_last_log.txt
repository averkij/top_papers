Text:"Can LLMs Maintain Fundamental Abilities under KV Cache Compression? Xiang Liu 1 Zhenheng Tang 2 Hong Chen 1 Peijie Dong 1 Zeyu Li 1 Xiuze Zhou 1 Bo Li 2 Xuming Hu 1 Xiaowen Chu 1 5 2 0 2 4 ] . [ 1 1 4 9 1 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract This paper investigates an under-explored challenge in large language models (LLMs): the impact of KV cache compression methods on LLMs fundamental capabilities. While existing methods achieve impressive compression ratios on longcontext benchmarks, their effects on core model capabilities remain understudied. We present comprehensive empirical study evaluating prominent KV cache compression methods across diverse tasks, spanning world knowledge, commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, code generation, safety, and long-context understanding and generation.Our analysis reveals that KV cache compression methods exhibit task-specific performance degradation. Arithmetic reasoning tasks prove particularly sensitive to aggressive compression, with different methods showing performance drops of 17.4%-43.3%. Notably, the DeepSeek R1 Distill model exhibits more robust compression tolerance compared to instructiontuned models, showing only 9.67%-25.53% performance degradation. Based on our analysis of attention patterns and cross-task compression performance, we propose ShotKV, novel compression approach that distinctly handles prefill and decoding phases while maintaining shot-level semantic coherence. Empirical results show that ShotKV achieves 9%-18% performance improvements on long-context generation tasks under aggressive compression ratios. 1.

Most progress in recent coder models has been driven by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), while the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of reliable reward data/model in the code domain. In this paper, we address this challenge by leveraging automated large-scale test-case synthesis to enhance code model training. Specifically, we design a pipeline that generates extensive (question, test-cases) pairs from existing code data. Using these test cases, we construct preference pairs based on pass rates over sampled programs to train reward models with Bradley-Terry loss. It shows an average of 10-point improvement for Llama-3.1-8B-Ins and 5-point improvement for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Ins through best-of-32 sampling, making the 7B model on par with 236B DeepSeek-V2.5. Furthermore, we conduct reinforcement learning with both reward models and test-case pass rewards, leading to consistent improvements across HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and LiveCodeBench (V4). Notably, we follow the R1-style training to start from Qwen2.5-Coder-base directly and show that our RL training can improve model on HumanEval-plus by over 25\% and MBPP-plus by 6\% for merely 80 optimization steps. We believe our results highlight the huge potential of reinforcement learning in coder models.
