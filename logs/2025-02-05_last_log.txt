Text:"Sample, Scrutinize and Scale: Effective Inference-Time Search by Scaling Verification Eric Zhao1,2 Pranjal Awasthi1 Sreenivas Gollapudi1 1Google Research, 2UC Berkeley 5 2 0 F 3 ] . [ 1 9 3 8 1 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract Sampling-based search, simple paradigm for utilizing test-time compute, involves generating multiple candidate responses and selecting the best onetypically by verifying each response for correctness. In this paper, we study the scaling trends governing sampling-based search. Among our findings is that simply scaling up minimalist implementation that uses only random sampling and direct self-verification results in sustained performance improvements that, for example, elevate the Gemini v1.5 Pro models reasoning capabilities past that of o1-Preview on popular benchmarks. We partially attribute the scalability of samplingbased search to phenomenon of implicit scaling, where sampling larger pool of responses in turn improves verification accuracy. We further identify two useful principles for improving self-verification capabilities with test-time compute: (1) comparing across responses provides helpful signals about the locations of errors and hallucinations, and (2) different model output styles are useful for different contextschains of thought are useful for reasoning but harder to verify. We also find that, though accurate verification can be elicited, frontier models demonstrate remarkably weak out-of-box verification capabilities and introduce benchmark to measure progress on these deficiencies. Recent advances in language models highlight the importance of test-time compute scaling wherein one uses more compute during inference to enhance reasoning capabilities [OpenAI, 2024, Team, 2025, Agarwal et al., 2024, Wei et al., 2022, Yao et al., 2023, Akyürek et al., 2024]. There are many methods for increasing test-time compute usage, including implicitly encouraging longer responses via reinforcement learning [OpenAI, 2024, Team, 2025] or explicitly "
