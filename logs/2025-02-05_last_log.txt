Text:"5 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 4 7 6 0 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Rethinking Mixture-of-Agents: Is Mixing Different Large Language Models Beneficial? Wenzhe Li*1, Yong Lin*1, Mengzhou Xia1, and Chi Jin 1Princeton University Abstract Ensembling outputs from diverse sources is straightforward yet effective approach to boost performance. Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) is one such popular ensemble method that aggregates outputs from multiple different Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper raises the question in the context of language models: is mixing different LLMs truly beneficial? We propose Self-MoA an ensemble method that aggregates outputs from only the single top-performing LLM. Our extensive experiments reveal that, surprisingly, Self-MoA outperforms standard MoA that mixes different LLMs in large number of scenarios: Self-MoA achieves 6.6% improvement over MoA on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, and an average of 3.8% improvement across various benchmarks, including MMLU, CRUX, and MATH. Applying Self-MoA to one of the top-ranking models in AlpacaEval 2.0 directly achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on the leaderboard. To understand the effectiveness of Self-MoA, we systematically investigate the trade-off between diversity and quality of outputs under various MoA settings. We confirm that the MoA performance is rather sensitive to the quality, and mixing different LLMs often lowers the average quality of the models. To complement the study, we identify the scenarios where mixing different LLMs could be helpful. This paper further introduces sequential version of Self-MoA, that is capable of aggregating large number of LLM outputs on-the-fly over multiple rounds, and is as effective as aggregating all outputs at once. Large language models have made remarkable strides in improving performance across different domains, with notable examples such as GPT [Achiam et al., 2023], Gemini [Team et al., 2023], and Claude [Anthropic, 2023].

Text:"Concept Steerers: Leveraging K-Sparse Autoencoders for Controllable Generations Dahye Kim 1 Deepti Ghadiyaram 1 2 5 2 0 2 1 3 ] . [ 1 6 6 0 9 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r Abstract Despite the remarkable progress in text-to-image generative models, they are prone to adversarial attacks and inadvertently generate unsafe, unethical content. Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning models to remove specific concepts, which is computationally expensive, lack scalability, and/or compromise generation quality. In this work, we propose novel framework leveraging k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAEs) to enable efficient and interpretable concept manipulation in diffusion models. Specifically, we first identify interpretable monosemantic concepts in the latent space of text embeddings and leverage them to precisely steer the generation away or towards given concept (e.g., nudity) or to introduce new concept (e.g., photographic style). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is very simple, requires no retraining of the base model nor LoRA adapters, does not compromise the generation quality, and is robust to adversarial prompt manipulations. Our method yields an improvement of 20.01% in unsafe concept removal, is effective in style manipulation, and is 5x faster than current state-of-the-art. 1. Introduction Text-to-image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content generation by producing diverse and highly photorealistic images, enabling wide range of applications such as digital art creation (Mazzone & Elgammal, 2019), image editing (Brooks et al., 2023), and medical imaging (Kazerouni et al., 2023). These models are usually trained on several billions of web-scraped image and text pairs presumably capturing broad spectrum of semantic concepts. Consequently, these models are also prone to be exposed to and thus generate disturbing content containing nudity, violence, child exploitation, and self-harm raising serious 1Department of Computer Science, Boston U"

Despite the remarkable progress in text-to-image generative models, they are prone to adversarial attacks and inadvertently generate unsafe, unethical content. Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning models to remove specific concepts, which is computationally expensive, lack scalability, and/or compromise generation quality. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAEs) to enable efficient and interpretable concept manipulation in diffusion models. Specifically, we first identify interpretable monosemantic concepts in the latent space of text embeddings and leverage them to precisely steer the generation away or towards a given concept (e.g., nudity) or to introduce a new concept (e.g., photographic style). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is very simple, requires no retraining of the base model nor LoRA adapters, does not compromise the generation quality, and is robust to adversarial prompt manipulations. Our method yields an improvement of 20.01% in unsafe concept removal, is effective in style manipulation, and is sim5x faster than current state-of-the-art.
