Generating procedural tutorials with AI is longstanding but challenging goal, facing three key obstacles: (1) scarcity of multi-task procedural datasets, (2) maintaining logical continuity and visual consistency between steps, and (3) generalizing across multiple domains. To address these challenges, we propose multi-domain dataset covering 21 tasks with over 24,000 procedural sequences. Building upon this foundation, we introduce MakeAnything, framework based on the diffusion transformer (DIT), which leverages fine-tuning to activate the in-context capabilities of DIT for generating consistent procedural sequences. We introduce asymmetric low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for image gen1Show Lab, Singapore. Correspondence <mike.zheng.shou@gmail.com>.

Additionally, our ReCraft model enables image-to-process generation through spatiotemporal consistency constraints, allowing static images to be decomposed into plausible creation sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MakeAnything surpasses existing methods, setting new performance benchmarks for procedural generation tasks. Code is released at https://github.com/showlab/MakeAnything 1. Introduction defining characteristic of human intelligenceand key differentiator from other speciesis the capacity to create complex artifacts through structured step-by-step processes. In computer vision, generating such procedural sequences for tasks like painting, crafting, product design, and culinary arts remains significant challenge. The core difficulty lies in producing multi-step sequences that maintain logical continuity and visual consistency, requiring models to both capture intricate visual features and understand causal Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2025 relationships between steps. This challenge becomes particularly pronounced when handling diverse domains and styles without compromising generation qualitya problem space that remains underexplored. hundreds or even dozens of process sequences per task. During inference, the model recursively predicts preceding frames over concatenated latent representations, effectively reconstructing the creation history from static artworks. Existing research primarily focuses on decomposing painting processes, with early methods employing reinforcement learning/optimization algorithms through stroke-based rendering to approximate target images. Subsequent works like ProcessPainter (Song et al., 2024a) and PaintsUndo (Team, 2024) utilize temporal models on synthetic datasets, while Inverse Painting (Chen et al., 2024)redicts the order of human painting, generating the painting process by region. However, these approaches remain limited to single-task scenarios and exhibit poor cross-domain generalization. Furthermore, ProcessPainters Animatediff-based framework constrains modifications to minor motion adjustments, making it unsuitable for categories requiring structural transformations (e.g., recipes or crafts). Although Diffusion Transformer (DIT) (Peebles & Xie, 2023)-based video generation models can produce long sequences, their effectiveness is hindered by distribution shifts in training data when generating complex procedural workflows. We posit that replicating human creative intelligence requires both high-quality multi-task procedural data and advanced methodology design.. To this end, we curate comprehensive multi-domain dataset spanning 21 categories (including painting, crafts, SVG design, LEGO assembly, and cooking) with over 24,000 procedurally annotated sequencesthe largest such collection for step-by-step creation tasks. Methodologically, we propose MakeAnything, novel framework that harnesses the in-context capabilities of Diffusion Transformers (DIT) through LoRA fine-tuning to generate high-quality instructional sequences. Addressing the challenge of severe data scarcity (some categories have as few as 50 data entries.) and imbalanced distributions, we employ an asymmetric low-rank adaptation (LoRA)(Zhu et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2022) strategy for image generation. This approach combines pretrained encoder on large-scale data with task-specific fine-tuned decoder, achieving an optimal balance between generalization and domain-specific performance. To address practical needs for reverse-engineering creation processes, we develop the ReCraft Modelan efficient controllable generation method that decomposes static images into step-by-step procedural sequences. Building upon the pretrained Flux model with minimal architectural modifications, ReCraft introduces an image-conditioning mechanism where clean latent tokens from the target image (encoded via VAE) guide the denoising of noisy intermediate frames through multi-modal attention. Remarkably, this lightweight adaptation enables efficient training with limited dataReCraft achieves robust performance with just In summary, our contributions are as follows: 1. Unified Procedural Generation Framework: We introduce MakeAnything, the first DIT-based architecture enabling cross-domain procedural sequence synthesis, supporting both text-to-process and image-toprocess generation paradigms. 2. Technical Innovations: We employ an asymmetric LoRA architecture for cross-domain generalization and the ReCraft Model for image-conditioned process reconstruction with limited training data. 3.

Text:"LongDPO: Unlock Better Long-form Generation Abilities for LLMs via Critique-augmented Stepwise Information Bowen Ping 1 Jiali Zeng 2 Fandong Meng 2 Shuo Wang 3 Jie Zhou 2 Shanghang Zhang 1 5 2 0 2 4 ] . [ 1 5 9 0 2 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract Long-form generation is crucial for academic writing papers and repo-level code generation. Despite this, current models, including GPT-4o, still exhibit unsatisfactory performance. Existing methods that utilize preference learning with outcome supervision often fail to provide detailed feedback for extended contexts. This shortcoming can lead to content that does not fully satisfy query requirements, resulting in issues like length deviations, and diminished quality. In this paper, we propose enhancing long-form generation by incorporating process supervision. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search to gather stepwise preference pairs, utilizing global memory pool to maintain consistency. To address the issue of suboptimal candidate selection, we integrate external critiques to refine and improve the quality of the preference pairs.

Text:"LongDPO: Unlock Better Long-form Generation Abilities for LLMs via Critique-augmented Stepwise Information Bowen Ping 1 Jiali Zeng 2 Fandong Meng 2 Shuo Wang 3 Jie Zhou 2 Shanghang Zhang 1 5 2 0 2 4 ] . [ 1 5 9 0 2 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract Long-form generation is crucial for academic writing papers and repo-level code generation. Despite this, current models, including GPT-4o, still exhibit unsatisfactory performance. Existing methods that utilize preference learning with outcome supervision often fail to provide detailed feedback for extended contexts. This shortcoming can lead to content that does not fully satisfy query requirements, resulting in issues like length deviations, and diminished quality. In this paper, we propose enhancing long-form generation by incorporating process supervision. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search to gather stepwise preference pairs, utilizing global memory pool to maintain consistency. To address the issue of suboptimal candidate selection, we integrate external critiques to refine and improve the quality of the preference pairs. Finally, we apply steplevel DPO using the collected stepwise preference pairs. Experimental results show that our method improves length and quality on long-form generation benchmarks, with almost lossless performance on general benchmarks across various model backbones. 1.

Correspondence to: Shanghang Zhang <shanghang@pku.edu.cn>. 1 Figure 1. The above is outcome supervision in long-form generation tasks. Below is LongDPO uses process supervision with global memory to maintain factual consistency, and external critiques to refine low-reward chosen candidates. in technology (Bai et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2024c). However, many LLMs still struggle to generate content exceeding 2,000 words, highlighting the need for further advancements in this area. Previous research has investigated methods to extend the output window by constructing long-form training data and utilizing preference learning. For example, Suri (Pham et al., 2024) creates various instructions for the same response and introduces instructional ORPO. LongWriter (Bai et al., 2024b) employs an agent-based pipeline that decomposes ultra-long generation tasks into subtasks to build long-form dataset, followed by supervised fine-tuning and DPO. These approaches primarily rely on outcome supervision (Lightman et al., 2024) during DPO, which provides feedback on the final result, for long-form generation tasks. Nevertheless, outcome supervision is not well-suited for long-form generation due to several key challenges. Specifically, outcome supervision means that intermediate steps are not adequately guided, potentially leading to loss of coherence and inconsistency in the final output (Zhang et al., 2024b). As result, this coarse supervision can produce conLongDPO: Unlock Better Long-form Generation Abilities for LLMs via Critique-augmented Stepwise Information tent that does not fully meet query requirements, leading to problems like length deviations or poor quality (Zhang et al., 2024b; Bai et al., 2024b). The absence of fine-grained feedback prevents the model from learning to improve particular aspects of the output. In this paper, we introduce novel approach called LongDPO for long-form generation using step-level supervision. Our method is divided into two main components: constructing preference data with stepwise supervision signals and implementing stepwise DPO. Specifically, we employ Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Browne et al., 2012) with large language model (LLM) acting as judge during the evaluation phase to collect stepwise preference pairs. To maintain consistency in the generated text, we incorporate global memory pool to store factual content from selected nodes during the MCTS search. However, not all chosen candidates in the collected preference pairs are of high quality. To address this issue, we utilize the judge model from the MCTS evaluation phase to provide critiques, followed by critique-augmented generation to refine the chosen candidates. Compared to external critiques, searching for additional solutions is inefficient and may yield only limited performance improvements (Qi et al., 2024). Additionally, relying solely on self-critique, which depends on the models inherent capabilities, can result in unstable performance gains (Qi et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024c). Given the high-quality stepwise preference pair data, we propose using stepwise DPO for training to enhance the learning process. As shown in Figure 1, vanilla DPO applies sample-wise supervision directly. Previous work has shown that this approach may result in less distinct reward margin, making learning more difficult (Lai et al., 2024). In contrast, LongDPO uses fine-grained learning at each step, which may yield better results. We evaluate long-form generation capabilities with specific length requirements and the ability to follow complex longform instructions using LongBench-Write-en and LongGenBench (Bai et al., 2024b; Wu et al., 2024c), as well as several general benchmarks such as TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) to assess general task performance. Our method, built on Llamaand Qwen-based backbones, outperforms their DPO versions in long-form generation tasks while maintaining near-lossless performance on general tasks. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose LongDPO, which differs from traditional outcome supervision by adopting process supervision. LongDPO enables step-wise, more fine-grained learning for long-form text generation. To implement process supervision, we introduce MCTS to construct step-level preference data. Specifically, we utilize global memory pool to maintain 2 factual consistency "

A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to create complex artifacts through structured multi-step processes. Generating procedural tutorials with AI is a longstanding but challenging goal, facing three key obstacles: (1) scarcity of multi-task procedural datasets, (2) maintaining logical continuity and visual consistency between steps, and (3) generalizing across multiple domains. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-domain dataset covering 21 tasks with over 24,000 procedural sequences. Building upon this foundation, we introduce MakeAnything, a framework based on the diffusion transformer (DIT), which leverages fine-tuning to activate the in-context capabilities of DIT for generating consistent procedural sequences. We introduce asymmetric low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for image generation, which balances generalization capabilities and task-specific performance by freezing encoder parameters while adaptively tuning decoder layers. Additionally, our ReCraft model enables image-to-process generation through spatiotemporal consistency constraints, allowing static images to be decomposed into plausible creation sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MakeAnything surpasses existing methods, setting new performance benchmarks for procedural generation tasks.

"A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to create complex artifacts through structured multi-step processes. Generating procedural tutorials with AI is a longstanding but challenging goal, facing three key obstacles: (1) scarcity of multi-task procedural datasets, (2) maintaining logical continuity and visual consistency between steps, and (3) generalizing across multiple domains. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-domain dataset covering 21 tasks with over 24,000 procedural sequences. Building upon this foundation, we introduce MakeAnything, a framework based on the diffusion transformer (DIT), which leverages fine-tuning to activate the in-context capabilities of DIT for generating consistent procedural sequences. We introduce asymmetric low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for image generation, which balances generalization capabilities and task-specific performance by freezing encoder parameters while adaptively tuning decoder layers. Additionally, our ReCraft model enables image-to-process generation through spatiotemporal consistency constraints, allowing static images to be decomposed into plausible creation sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MakeAnything surpasses existing methods, setting new performance benchmarks for procedural generation tasks."

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have shown impressive results in reducing the number of trainable parameters and memory requirements of large transformer networks while maintaining fine-tuning performance. However, the low-rank nature of the weight update inherently limits the representation power of fine-tuned models, potentially compromising performance on complex tasks. This raises a critical question: when a performance gap between LoRA and standard fine-tuning is observed, is it due to the reduced number of trainable parameters or the rank deficiency? This paper aims to answer this question by introducing RandLoRA, a parameter-efficient method that performs full-rank updates using a learned linear combinations of low-rank, non-trainable random matrices. Our method limits the number of trainable parameters by restricting optimization to diagonal scaling matrices applied to the fixed random matrices. This allows us to effectively overcome the low-rank limitations while maintaining parameter and memory efficiency during training. Through extensive experimentation across vision, language, and vision-language benchmarks, we systematically evaluate the limitations of LoRA and existing random basis methods. Our findings reveal that full-rank updates are beneficial across vision and language tasks individually, and even more so for vision-language tasks, where RandLoRA significantly reduces -- and sometimes eliminates -- the performance gap between standard fine-tuning and LoRA, demonstrating its efficacy.

Long-form generation is crucial for academic writing papers and repo-level code generation. Despite this, current models, including GPT-4o, still exhibit unsatisfactory performance. Existing methods that utilize preference learning with outcome supervision often fail to provide detailed feedback for extended contexts. This shortcoming can lead to content that does not fully satisfy query requirements, resulting in issues like length deviations, and diminished quality. In this paper, we propose enhancing long-form generation by incorporating process supervision. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search to gather stepwise preference pairs, utilizing a global memory pool to maintain consistency. To address the issue of suboptimal candidate selection, we integrate external critiques to refine and improve the quality of the preference pairs. Finally, we apply step-level DPO using the collected stepwise preference pairs. Experimental results show that our method improves length and quality on long-form generation benchmarks, with almost lossless performance on general benchmarks across various model backbones.
