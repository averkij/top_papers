[ 1 2 6 3 1 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract Learning diffusion bridge models is easy; making them fast and practical is an art. Diffusion bridge models (DBMs) are promising extension of diffusion models for applications in image-toimage translation. However, like many modern diffusion and flow models, DBMs suffer from the problem of slow inference. To address it, we propose novel distillation technique based on the inverse bridge matching formulation and derive the tractable objective to solve it in practice. Unlike previously developed DBM distillation techniques, the proposed method can distill both conditional and unconditional types of DBMs, distill models in one-step generator, and use only the corrupted images for training. We evaluate our approach for both conditional and unconditional types of bridge matching on wide set of setups, including super-resolution, JPEG restoration, sketch-to-image, and other tasks, and show that our distillation technique allows us to accelerate the inference of DBMs from 4x to 100x and even provide better generation quality than used teacher model depending on particular setup. 1. Introduction Diffusion Bridge Models (DBMs) represent specialized class of diffusion models designed for data-to-data tasks, such as image-to-image translation. Unlike standard diffusion models, which operate by mapping noise to data (Ho et al., 2020; Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015), DBMs construct diffusion processes directly between two data distributions (Peluchetti, 2023a; Liu et al., 2022b; Somnath et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024a; Yue et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2023; De Bortoli et al., 2023). This approach allows DBMs to modify only the necessary components of the data, starting from an input sample rather than generating it entirely from Gaus- *Equal contribution 1Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology 2Yandex Research"
