The dataset also facilitates several downstream tasks, such as visual question-answering (VQA) and referring segmentation.This paper introduces the COCONut-PanCap dataset, created to enhance panoptic segmentation and grounded image captioning. Building upon the COCO dataset with advanced COCONut panoptic masks, this dataset aims to overcome limitations in existing image-text datasets that often lack detailed, scene-comprehensive descriptions. The COCONut-PanCap dataset incorporates fine-grained, region-level captions grounded in panoptic segmentation masks, ensuring consistency and improving the detail of generated captions. Through human-edited, densely annotated descriptions, COCONut-PanCap supports improved training of vision-language models (VLMs) for image understanding and generative models for text-to-image tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that COCONut-PanCap significantly boosts performance across understanding and generation tasks, offering complementary benefits to largescale datasets. This dataset sets new benchmark for evaluating models on joint panoptic segmentation and grounded captioning tasks, addressing the need for high-quality, detailed image-text annotations in multi-modal learning. 1. Introduction Recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models have been largely driven by the availability of large-scale paired text-image datasets. These datasets, often collected via web crawling with basic filtering techniques [14, 52, 53], contain low-quality, web-sourced captions that lack depth and accuracy. In contrast, human-annotated caption datasets, such as COCO-caption [6], offer higher-quality descriptions but are limited in scale and tend to be concise, with an average caption length of 10 words. To overcome the limitations of short captions, the research community has leveraged vision-language models (VLMs) [5, 31, 32, 38, 60] to generate detailed synthetic captions. While these machine-generated captions improve visual understanding [5, 32] and generation tasks [31], they remain inferior to high-quality, human-verified annotations [44]. Addressing this challenge requires balancing scalability and annotation quality, as generating detailed and accurate image descriptions at scale remains labor-intensive [15, 44]. In this paper, we introduce an efficient annotation approach that combines dense mask annotations with commercial VLMs [5] to produce high-quality image captions. Our goal is to minimize human effort while generating rich, structured descriptions. To achieve this, we base our work on the COCO-caption dataset [6] due to its widespread use and diverse image content. We revisit the COCO-caption dataset to provide more detailed and comprehensive caption annotations. Our approach involves creating holistic captions synthesized from region-based dense captions that describe distinct areas within each image. Specifically, we build on recent COCONut panoptic segmentation annotations [9] to generate new set of detailed captions by: (a) annotating each segmentation region with VLM-generated draft, carefully refined through human corrections, and (b) summarizing these region captions into comprehensive image caption while preserving the grounding correspondence between image masks and object references. This enables novel task that integrates panoptic segmentation with grounded captioning. Our structured annotation process ensures that the captions are both complete, covering the majority of objects in each image, and grounded, with precise segmentation masks. The final dataset, named COCONut-PanCap, is designed for wide range of vision-language applications, combining Panoptic segmentation and grounded Captioning. It comprises 118K image-text pairs for training, with an average caption length of 203 words, as well as an additional 25K image-text pairs, with an average caption length of 233 words for validation. We demonstrate that COCONut-PanCap significantly boosts the performance of both VLM and text-to-image generation models at the instruction tuning and fine-tuning stages, outperforming recent detailed caption datasets [44]. This highlights the potential of our grounding-based captions for both visionlanguage understanding and image generation tasks. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We propose caption annotation pipeline leveraging panoptic segmentation to create high-quality, detailed caption dataset comprising 143K annotated images. The resulting annotations are comprehensive, accurate, and include grounding masks, making this dataset substantially larger than recent detailed caption datasets. Our COCONut-PanCap dataset facilitates new challenging task combining Panoptic segmentation and Grounded Captioning (PGC). We establish evaluation metrics and settings for this PGC task and benchmark several recent methods to assess performance on this novel challenge. We validate the utility of our proposed dataset across various fine-grained Image-to-Text (I2T) and Text-to-Image (T2I) tasks, including detailed caption generation, PGC, visual question answering (VQA), referring segmentation, and text-conditioned image generation. Experimental results show that our dataset significantly enhances model performance across all these tasks. 2. Related Work Detailed Captions from VLMs. Researchers are increasingly interested in creating large-scale datasets with detailed captions generated from advanced vision-language models. DenseFusion1M [32] utilizes pretrained perceptual model to prompt VLMs, facilitating more detailed image descriptions. Recap-DataComp1B [31] first fine-tunes the Llama-38B powered LLaVA-1.5 model [36], then applies it to recaption approximately 1.3 billion images from the DataComp1B dataset [14], generating rich repository of detailed image descriptions. On similar front, the PixelProse dataset [59] offers general-purpose image captions designed to serve various applications,"

"This paper introduces the COCONut-PanCap dataset, created to enhance panoptic segmentation and grounded image captioning. Building upon the COCO dataset with advanced COCONut panoptic masks, this dataset aims to overcome limitations in existing image-text datasets that often lack detailed, scene-comprehensive descriptions. The COCONut-PanCap dataset incorporates fine-grained, region-level captions grounded in panoptic segmentation masks, ensuring consistency and improving the detail of generated captions. Through human-edited, densely annotated descriptions, COCONut-PanCap supports improved training of vision-language models (VLMs) for image understanding and generative models for text-to-image tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that COCONut-PanCap significantly boosts performance across understanding and generation tasks, offering complementary benefits to large-scale datasets. This dataset sets a new benchmark for evaluating models on joint panoptic segmentation and grounded captioning tasks, addressing the need for high-quality, detailed image-text annotations in multi-modal learning."
