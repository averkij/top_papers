[ 1 1 2 4 3 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r Figure 1. (a) presents the core insights of our approach. Unlike previous works, we enhance semantic information along the forward pass of the rectified flow via reconstruction distillation. Fig. (b) shows that increasing the latent space dimension consistently improves the generation performance of RecTok, indicating that the dimensional bottleneck no longer constrains the semantic information encoded in the latent features. (c) compares the gFID convergence across training epochs, where our method converges 7.75 faster than prior works and achieves final gFID of 1.34 without classifier-free guidance, the state-of-the-art gFID performance to date.

Text:"DiffusionBrowser: Interactive Diffusion Previews via Multi-Branch Decoders Susung Hong1, Chongjian Ge2 1 University of Washington Zhifei Zhang2 Jui-Hsien Wang2 2 Adobe Research https://susunghong.github.io/DiffusionBrowser 5 2 0 2 5 1 ] . [ 1 0 9 6 3 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r Figure 1. DiffusionBrowser is plug-and-play model that enables interactive previews anywhere in the multi-step diffusion process, which allows users to make decisions about whether to continue denoising or modify prompts. In addition, DiffusionBrowser provides multiple variation generation mechanisms that guide users to explore the creative generation space in tree-like structure. Our novel, efficient multibranch decoder architecture preserves the full capacity of the base model, and can generate rich multi-modal previews for each timestep in < 1s, adding negligible overhead at inference time.

RecTok improves diffusion models by enriching forward flow semantics and enhancing reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art results with high-dimensional visual tokenizers.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual tokenizers play a crucial role in diffusion models. The dimensionality of latent space governs both reconstruction fidelity and the semantic expressiveness of the latent feature. However, a fundamental trade-off is inherent between dimensionality and generation quality, constraining existing methods to low-dimensional latent spaces. Although recent works have leveraged vision foundation models to enrich the semantics of visual tokenizers and accelerate convergence, high-dimensional tokenizers still underperform their low-dimensional counterparts. In this work, we propose RecTok, which overcomes the limitations of high-dimensional visual tokenizers through two key innovations: flow semantic distillation and reconstruction--alignment distillation. Our key insight is to make the forward flow in flow matching semantically rich, which serves as the training space of diffusion transformers, rather than focusing on the latent space as in previous works. Specifically, our method distills the semantic information in VFMs into the forward flow trajectories in flow matching. And we further enhance the semantics by introducing a masked feature reconstruction loss. Our RecTok achieves superior image reconstruction, generation quality, and discriminative performance. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the gFID-50K under both with and without classifier-free guidance settings, while maintaining a semantically rich latent space structure. Furthermore, as the latent dimensionality increases, we observe consistent improvements. Code and model are available at https://shi-qingyu.github.io/rectok.github.io.

DiffusionBrowser enables interactive video preview generation and control during the denoising process, enhancing user experience and revealing model composition details.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video diffusion models have revolutionized generative video synthesis, but they are imprecise, slow, and can be opaque during generation -- keeping users in the dark for a prolonged period. In this work, we propose DiffusionBrowser, a model-agnostic, lightweight decoder framework that allows users to interactively generate previews at any point (timestep or transformer block) during the denoising process. Our model can generate multi-modal preview representations that include RGB and scene intrinsics at more than 4times real-time speed (less than 1 second for a 4-second video) that convey consistent appearance and motion to the final video. With the trained decoder, we show that it is possible to interactively guide the generation at intermediate noise steps via stochasticity reinjection and modal steering, unlocking a new control capability. Moreover, we systematically probe the model using the learned decoders, revealing how scene, object, and other details are composed and assembled during the otherwise black-box denoising process.
