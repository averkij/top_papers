Text:"5 2 0 2 2 1 ] . [ 2 1 7 0 0 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r Openpi Comet: Competition Solution For 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge Team Comet https://huggingface.co/sunshk/comet_submission https://github.com/mli0603/openpi-cometThe 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge is designed to rigorously track progress toward solving long-horizon tasks by physical agents in simulated environments. BEHAVIOR-1K focuses on everyday household tasks that people most want robots to assist with and these tasks introduce long-horizon mobile manipulation challenges in realistic settings, bridging the gap between current research and real-world, human-centric applications. This report presents our solution to the 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge in very close 2nd place and substantially outperforms the rest of the submissions. Building on π0.5, we focus on systematically building our solution by studying the effects of training techniques and data. Through careful ablations, we show the scaling power in pre-training and post-training phases for competitive performance. We summarize our practical lessons and design recommendations that we hope will provide actionable insights for the broader embodied AI community when adapting powerful foundation models to complex embodied scenarios.Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models (Brohan et al., 2022; 2023; Octo Model Team et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024; Qu et al., 2025; Black et al., 2024) have recently emerged as unifying paradigm for robotic policy learning, leveraging large-scale robot datasets to acquire robust and generalizable manipulation and navigation capabilities. By integrating perception, language understanding, and control within single end-to-end framework, VLAs bypass the need for hand-engineered modules and have demonstrated strong performance across variety of embodied AI benchmarks. Despite this progress, most existing VLA systems are primarily optimized for short-horizon tasks, and their ability to scale to complex, temporally extended activities remains limited. Long-horizon manipulation (Zhao et al., 2025; Zawalski et al., 2024) introduces additional difficulties that fundamentally challenge current VLA designs. Such tasks require orchestrated sequences of interdependent behaviors, where compounding errors and shifting state distributions can degrade performance over time. common approach is to decompose tasks into subtasks (Lin et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2023; Tie et al., 2025) and train separate local policies. However, this strategy does not resolve the skill chaining problem (Chen et al., 2024; Konidaris & Barto, 2009), which involves modeling and executing reliable transitions between subtasks while mitigating error accumulation. In addition, many solutions proposed for skill chaining rely on online adaptation or modular architectures, and these methods are often incompatible with the large-scale, offline, end-to-end training paradigm that underpins modern VLA models. Consequently, achieving reliable long-horizon performance while preserving scalability and generality remains an open challenge. The BEHAVIOR Challenge, built upon the BEHAVIOR-1K (Li et al., 2024) benchmark, provides an rigorous benchmark for this problem. It features realistic household environments containing complex object interactions, and evaluates agents on 50 long-horizon tasks that reflect human-centered daily activities. Each task requires multi-step reasoning, precise manipulation, and coordinated navigation, making success highly dependent on robust long-horizon policy execution. With 10,000 expert demonstrations and standardized evaluation protocol, the challenge places strong emphasis on generalization, control robustness, and error tolerance. These capabilities remain difficult for current VLA models to achieve consistently. In this report, we examine how far strong publicly available VLA backbone can be pushed on longhorizon tasks using careful data, training, and inference design within simple end-to-end training pipeline. We treat the BEHAVIOR Challenge as case study in adapting powerful but generic foundation policies to complex embodied benchmark. Through systematic exploration of training configurations, pre-training choices, and inference strategies, we show that our solution completes 22 tasks out of the 50 household tasks, achieving Q-score of 0.2514 in the competition Table 1. 1 Table 1: Results of 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge for standard track.

The action expert is implemented as transformer-style network that ingests features and denoises the low-level continuous control actions at each timestep. This end-to-end architecture allows perception, language understanding, and control to be trained jointly from large-scale robot datasets, and π0.5 further enhances generalization by being pretrained on heterogeneous data spanning multiple embodiments, environments, and tasks. The dataset includes the 1k hours human demonstrations officially provided by the BEHAVIOR Challenge, as well as our additional motion-planner trajectories and offline RL rollouts, which together supply rich long-horizon behaviors and diverse manipulation strategies crucial for robust policy learning. For post-training, we adopt an iterative RFT procedure as illustrated in Figure 1(b). Starting from the official human demonstrations, we introduce random pose perturbations and roll out the pretrained policy under these disturbed initial conditions. Successful episodes are retained as additional training data, progressively forming an offline data flywheel that continually improves the robustness and coverage of the policy. Figure 1: (a) Pre-training on large-scale heterogeneous data, including 1.1K hours of human demonstrations and 0.4K hours of additional planner and offline RL trajectories. (b) RFT post-training: perturb initial poses, roll out the policy, and retain successful episodes to iteratively augment "

We introduce Error-Free Linear Attention (EFLA), numerically stable, fully parallelism and generalized formulation of the delta rule. Specifically, we formulate the online learning update as continuous-time dynamical system and prove that its exact solution is not only attainable but also computable in linear time with full parallelism. By leveraging the rank-1 structure of the dynamics matrix, we directly derive the exact closed-form solution effectively corresponding to the infinite-order RungeKutta method. This attention mechanism is theoretically free from error accumulation, perfectly capturing the continuous dynamics while preserving the linear-time complexity. Through an extensive suite of experiments, we show that EFLA enables robust performance in noisy environments, achieving lower language modeling perplexity and superior downstream benchmark performance than DeltaNet without introducing additional parameters. Our work provides new theoretical foundation for building high-fidelity, scalable linear-time attention models.

"A solution for the 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge in everyday household tasks using pre-training and post-training techniques substantially outperforms other submissions.  					AI-generated summary 				 The 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge is designed to rigorously track progress toward solving long-horizon tasks by physical agents in simulated environments. BEHAVIOR-1K focuses on everyday household tasks that people most want robots to assist with and these tasks introduce long-horizon mobile manipulation challenges in realistic settings, bridging the gap between current research and real-world, human-centric applications. This report presents our solution to the 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge in a very close 2nd place and substantially outperforms the rest of the submissions. Building on π_{0.5}, we focus on systematically building our solution by studying the effects of training techniques and data. Through careful ablations, we show the scaling power in pre-training and post-training phases for competitive performance. We summarize our practical lessons and design recommendations that we hope will provide actionable insights for the broader embodied AI community when adapting powerful foundation models to complex embodied scenarios."

**Reasoning:** The paper focuses on systematically studying the effects of training techniques (pre-training and post-training phases) and their scaling power to achieve competitive performance on the BEHAVIOR Challenge. This directly relates to optimization methods for training. While the paper involves embodied AI and robotics tasks, these are application domains rather than the core methodological contribution. The emphasis on "training techniques," "ablations," and "scaling power" in the training phases aligns with the OPTIMIZATION topic.

MentraSuite, a unified framework, advances reliable mental health reasoning using Mindora, a post-trained model with hybrid SFT-RL, evaluated via MentraBench, a benchmark assessing task performance and reasoning quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Mental health disorders affect hundreds of millions globally, and the Web now serves as a primary medium for accessing support, information, and assessment. Large language models (LLMs) offer scalable and accessible assistance, yet their deployment in mental-health settings remains risky when their reasoning is incomplete, inconsistent, or ungrounded. Existing psychological LLMs emphasize emotional understanding or knowledge recall but overlook the step-wise, clinically aligned reasoning required for appraisal, diagnosis, intervention planning, abstraction, and verification. To address these issues, we introduce MentraSuite, a unified framework for advancing reliable mental-health reasoning. We propose MentraBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning five core reasoning aspects, six tasks, and 13 datasets, evaluating both task performance and reasoning quality across five dimensions: conciseness, coherence, hallucination avoidance, task understanding, and internal consistency. We further present Mindora, a post-trained model optimized through a hybrid SFT-RL framework with an inconsistency-detection reward to enforce faithful and coherent reasoning. To support training, we construct high-quality trajectories using a novel reasoning trajectory generation strategy, that strategically filters difficult samples and applies a structured, consistency-oriented rewriting process to produce concise, readable, and well-balanced trajectories. Across 20 evaluated LLMs, Mindora achieves the highest average performance on MentraBench and shows remarkable performances in reasoning reliability, demonstrating its effectiveness for complex mental-health scenarios.

Error-Free Linear Attention (EFLA) is a stable, parallelizable, and theoretically sound linear-time attention mechanism that outperforms DeltaNet in language modeling and downstream tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Linear-time attention and State Space Models (SSMs) promise to solve the quadratic cost bottleneck in long-context language models employing softmax attention. We introduce Error-Free Linear Attention (EFLA), a numerically stable, fully parallelism and generalized formulation of the delta rule. Specifically, we formulate the online learning update as a continuous-time dynamical system and prove that its exact solution is not only attainable but also computable in linear time with full parallelism. By leveraging the rank-1 structure of the dynamics matrix, we directly derive the exact closed-form solution effectively corresponding to the infinite-order Runge-Kutta method. This attention mechanism is theoretically free from error accumulation, perfectly capturing the continuous dynamics while preserving the linear-time complexity. Through an extensive suite of experiments, we show that EFLA enables robust performance in noisy environments, achieving lower language modeling perplexity and superior downstream benchmark performance than DeltaNet without introducing additional parameters. Our work provides a new theoretical foundation for building high-fidelity, scalable linear-time attention models.

NL2Repo Bench evaluates long-horizon software development capabilities of coding agents by assessing their ability to generate complete Python libraries from natural-language requirements.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in coding agents suggest rapid progress toward autonomous software development, yet existing benchmarks fail to rigorously evaluate the long-horizon capabilities required to build complete software systems. Most prior evaluations focus on localized code generation, scaffolded completion, or short-term repair tasks, leaving open the question of whether agents can sustain coherent reasoning, planning, and execution over the extended horizons demanded by real-world repository construction. To address this gap, we present NL2Repo Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the long-horizon repository generation ability of coding agents. Given only a single natural-language requirements document and an empty workspace, agents must autonomously design the architecture, manage dependencies, implement multi-module logic, and produce a fully installable Python library. Our experiments across state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models reveal that long-horizon repository generation remains largely unsolved: even the strongest agents achieve below 40% average test pass rates and rarely complete an entire repository correctly. Detailed analysis uncovers fundamental long-horizon failure modes, including premature termination, loss of global coherence, fragile cross-file dependencies, and inadequate planning over hundreds of interaction steps. NL2Repo Bench establishes a rigorous, verifiable testbed for measuring sustained agentic competence and highlights long-horizon reasoning as a central bottleneck for the next generation of autonomous coding agents.

"NL2Repo Bench evaluates long-horizon software development capabilities of coding agents by assessing their ability to generate complete Python libraries from natural-language requirements.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in coding agents suggest rapid progress toward autonomous software development, yet existing benchmarks fail to rigorously evaluate the long-horizon capabilities required to build complete software systems. Most prior evaluations focus on localized code generation, scaffolded completion, or short-term repair tasks, leaving open the question of whether agents can sustain coherent reasoning, planning, and execution over the extended horizons demanded by real-world repository construction. To address this gap, we present NL2Repo Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the long-horizon repository generation ability of coding agents. Given only a single natural-language requirements document and an empty workspace, agents must autonomously design the architecture, manage dependencies, implement multi-module logic, and produce a fully installable Python library. Our experiments across state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models reveal that long-horizon repository generation remains largely unsolved: even the strongest agents achieve below 40% average test pass rates and rarely complete an entire repository correctly. Detailed analysis uncovers fundamental long-horizon failure modes, including premature termination, loss of global coherence, fragile cross-file dependencies, and inadequate planning over hundreds of interaction steps. NL2Repo Bench establishes a rigorous, verifiable testbed for measuring sustained agentic competence and highlights long-horizon reasoning as a central bottleneck for the next generation of autonomous coding agents."

State-of-the-art image generation and reward models exhibit bias towards conventional aesthetics, often failing to produce anti-aesthetic images as requested, thus compromising user autonomy and aesthetic diversity.  					AI-generated summary 				 Over-aligning image generation models to a generalized aesthetic preference conflicts with user intent, particularly when ``anti-aesthetic" outputs are requested for artistic or critical purposes. This adherence prioritizes developer-centered values, compromising user autonomy and aesthetic pluralism. We test this bias by constructing a wide-spectrum aesthetics dataset and evaluating state-of-the-art generation and reward models. We find that aesthetic-aligned generation models frequently default to conventionally beautiful outputs, failing to respect instructions for low-quality or negative imagery. Crucially, reward models penalize anti-aesthetic images even when they perfectly match the explicit user prompt. We confirm this systemic bias through image-to-image editing and evaluation against real abstract artworks.

**Justification:**

- **ETHICS**: The paper directly addresses AI ethics concerns including fairness, bias, and user autonomy. It discusses how image generation models exhibit bias towards conventional aesthetics, compromising aesthetic diversity and user autonomy.

- **ALIGNMENT**: The paper explicitly discusses the problem of over-alignment in image generation models, where models are aligned to generalized aesthetic preferences that conflict with user intent. It examines how reward models penalize outputs that don't match developer-centered values, which is a core alignment issue about ensuring models behave according to user preferences rather than developer assumptions.

Diffusion Preview uses ConsistencySolver, a high-order trainable solver, to improve quality and consistency in low-step image generation, enhancing interactive user experiences.  					AI-generated summary 				 The slow inference process of image diffusion models significantly degrades interactive user experiences. To address this, we introduce Diffusion Preview, a novel paradigm employing rapid, low-step sampling to generate preliminary outputs for user evaluation, deferring full-step refinement until the preview is deemed satisfactory. Existing acceleration methods, including training-free solvers and post-training distillation, struggle to deliver high-quality previews or ensure consistency between previews and final outputs. We propose ConsistencySolver derived from general linear multistep methods, a lightweight, trainable high-order solver optimized via Reinforcement Learning, that enhances preview quality and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that ConsistencySolver significantly improves generation quality and consistency in low-step scenarios, making it ideal for efficient preview-and-refine workflows. Notably, it achieves FID scores on-par with Multistep DPM-Solver using 47% fewer steps, while outperforming distillation baselines. Furthermore, user studies indicate our approach reduces overall user interaction time by nearly 50% while maintaining generation quality. Code is available at https://github.com/G-U-N/consolver.
