We present the first systematic study that adapts and compares state-of-the-art distillation techniques on strong T2I teacher model, FLUX.1-lite. By casting existing methods into unified framework, we identify the key obstacles that arise when moving from discrete class labels to free-form language prompts. Beyond thorough methodological analysis, we offer practical guidelines on input scaling, network architecture, and hyperparameters, accompanied by an open-source implementation and pretrained student models. Our findings establish solid foundation for deploying fast, high-fidelity, and resource-efficient diffusion generators in real-world T2I applications. Code is available on github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/T2I-Distill. Date: December 16, In recent years, large-scale Diffusion Models (DMs) (Ho et al., 2020; Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015) have achieved unprecedented success in the field of text-to-image synthesis, with generation quality that rivals or even surpasses human creation (Rombach et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022). Models such as Flux (Black Forest Labs et al., 2025), Qwen-Image (Wu et al., 2025) and Imagen (Google DeepMind, 2025), trained on massive image-text datasets, can generate high-fidelity, high-resolution images from complex textual descriptions. However, this remarkable performance comes at significant computational cost. These models rely on an iterative sampling process, progressively converting Gaussian noise into clear image through hundreds of N"

[ 1 8 3 4 1 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r Flowception: Temporally Expansive Flow Matching for Video Generation Tariq Berrada Ifriqi1,2, John Nguyen1, Karteek Alahari2, Jakob Verbeek1, Ricky Chen1 1FAIR at Meta, 2Univ. Grenoble Alpes, Inria, CNRS, Grenoble INP, LJK, France We present Flowception, novel non-autoregressive and variable-length video generation framework. Flowception learns probability path that interleaves discrete frame insertions with continuous frame denoising. Compared to autoregressive methods, Flowception alleviates error accumulation/drift as the frame insertion mechanism during sampling serves as an efficient compression mechanism to handle long-term context. Compared to full-sequence flows, our method reduces FLOPs for training three-fold, while also being more amenable to local attention variants, and allowing to learn the length of videos jointly with their content. Quantitative experimental results show improved FVD and VBench metrics over autoregressive and full-sequence baselines, which is further validated with qualitative results. Finally, by learning to insert and denoise frames in sequence, Flowception seamlessly integrates different tasks such as image-to-video generation and video interpolation. Correspondence: First Author at tariqberrada@meta.com Figure 1 Examples of image-to-video (I2V) generation and video interpolation with Flowception . Input frames marked by dashed boundaries. Flowception enables variable-length non-autoregressive generation by learning to both denoise and insert frames in any order. Recent advances in diffusion and flow-matching have unlocked high-fidelity image generation Esser et al. (2024); Labs (2024) and are rapidly migrating to video. Current video generation models typically adopt one of two paradigms: full-sequence generation denoises all frames jointly with full attention Wan et al. (2025); HaCohen et al. (2024); Zheng et al. (2024), while temporal autoregressive (AR) generation produces frames (or"

A systematic study adapts diffusion distillation techniques to text-to-image generation, providing guidelines for successful implementation and deployment.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion distillation has dramatically accelerated class-conditional image synthesis, but its applicability to open-ended text-to-image (T2I) generation is still unclear. We present the first systematic study that adapts and compares state-of-the-art distillation techniques on a strong T2I teacher model, FLUX.1-lite. By casting existing methods into a unified framework, we identify the key obstacles that arise when moving from discrete class labels to free-form language prompts. Beyond a thorough methodological analysis, we offer practical guidelines on input scaling, network architecture, and hyperparameters, accompanied by an open-source implementation and pretrained student models. Our findings establish a solid foundation for deploying fast, high-fidelity, and resource-efficient diffusion generators in real-world T2I applications. Code is available on github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/T2I-Distill.

Flowception, a non-autoregressive video generation framework, interleaves discrete frame insertions with continuous denoising, improving efficiency and performance over existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Flowception, a novel non-autoregressive and variable-length video generation framework. Flowception learns a probability path that interleaves discrete frame insertions with continuous frame denoising. Compared to autoregressive methods, Flowception alleviates error accumulation/drift as the frame insertion mechanism during sampling serves as an efficient compression mechanism to handle long-term context. Compared to full-sequence flows, our method reduces FLOPs for training three-fold, while also being more amenable to local attention variants, and allowing to learn the length of videos jointly with their content. Quantitative experimental results show improved FVD and VBench metrics over autoregressive and full-sequence baselines, which is further validated with qualitative results. Finally, by learning to insert and denoise frames in a sequence, Flowception seamlessly integrates different tasks such as image-to-video generation and video interpolation.

CAPTAIN, a training-free framework, mitigates memorization in diffusion models by modifying latent features during denoising, ensuring prompt fidelity and visual quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion models can unintentionally reproduce training examples, raising privacy and copyright concerns as these systems are increasingly deployed at scale. Existing inference-time mitigation methods typically manipulate classifier-free guidance (CFG) or perturb prompt embeddings; however, they often struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with the conditioning prompt. We introduce CAPTAIN, a training-free framework that mitigates memorization by directly modifying latent features during denoising. CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality. Our experiments show that CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt.

1. **DIFFUSION**: The paper explicitly focuses on diffusion models and proposes CAPTAIN, a framework for mitigating memorization in diffusion-based generative models.

2. **SECURITY**: The paper addresses privacy and copyright concerns related to diffusion models unintentionally reproducing training examples, which are security/privacy issues.

3. **HALLUCINATIONS**: While not using the exact term "hallucinations," the paper addresses memorization in diffusion models—the unintended reproduction of training examples—which is conceptually related to hallucinations as unwanted model behaviors that need mitigation.
