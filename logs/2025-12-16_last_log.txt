Directional Textual Inversion (DTI) improves text-to-image personalization by constraining learned tokens to unit magnitude, enhancing prompt conditioning and enabling smooth interpolation between concepts.  					AI-generated summary 				 Textual Inversion (TI) is an efficient approach to text-to-image personalization but often fails on complex prompts. We trace these failures to embedding norm inflation: learned tokens drift to out-of-distribution magnitudes, degrading prompt conditioning in pre-norm Transformers. Empirically, we show semantics are primarily encoded by direction in CLIP token space, while inflated norms harm contextualization; theoretically, we analyze how large magnitudes attenuate positional information and hinder residual updates in pre-norm blocks. We propose Directional Textual Inversion (DTI), which fixes the embedding magnitude to an in-distribution scale and optimizes only direction on the unit hypersphere via Riemannian SGD. We cast direction learning as MAP with a von Mises-Fisher prior, yielding a constant-direction prior gradient that is simple and efficient to incorporate. Across personalization tasks, DTI improves text fidelity over TI and TI-variants while maintaining subject similarity. Crucially, DTI's hyperspherical parameterization enables smooth, semantically coherent interpolation between learned concepts (slerp), a capability that is absent in standard TI. Our findings suggest that direction-only optimization is a robust and scalable path for prompt-faithful personalization.

Авторы выявили, что стандартный метод Textual Inversion страдает от инфляции норм эмбеддингов, что приводит к деградации обусловленности запроса в transformer-моделях. Они показали как теоретически, так и эмпирически, что семантика в CLIP-пространстве кодируется в основном направлением вектора, а не его величиной, и предложили оптимизировать только направление на единичной гиперсфере с помощью риманова SGD с von Mises-Fisher приором. Предложенный метод обеспечивает лучшую верность текстовых подсказок при сохранении сходства объектов и позволяет выполнять гладкую интерполяцию между изученными концепциями.",
