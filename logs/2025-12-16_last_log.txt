Its also long-horizon and knowledge-intensive: workflows interleave multiple tasks and span diverse domains such as budgeting, trading, asset management, and operations.We introduce finance & accounting benchmark (FINCH) for evaluating AI agents on real-world, enterprise-grade professional workflowsinterleaving data entry, structuring, formatting, web search, cross-file retrieval, calculation, modeling, validation, translation, visualization, and reporting. FINCH is sourced from authentic enterprise workspaces at Enron (15,000 spreadsheets and 500,000 emails from 150 employees) and other financial institutions, preserving in-the-wild messiness across multimodal artifacts (text, tables, formulas, charts, code, and images) and spanning diverse domains such as budgeting, trading, and asset management. We propose workflow construction process that combines LLM-assisted discovery with expert annotation: (1) LLM-assisted, expert-verified derivation of workflows from real-world email threads and version histories of spreadsheet files, and (2) meticulous expert annotation for workflows, requiring over 700 hours of domainexpert effort. This yields 172 composite workflows with 384 tasks, involving 1,710 spreadsheets with 27 million cells, along with PDFs and other artifacts, capturing the intrinsically messy, long-horizon, knowledge-intensive, and collaborative nature of real-world enterprise work. We conduct both human and automated evaluations of frontier AI systems including GPT 5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok 4, and Qwen 3 Max, and GPT 5.1 Pro spends 48 hours in total yet passes only 38.4% of workflows, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 passes just 25.0%. Comprehensive case studies further surface the challenges that real-world enterprise workflows pose for AI agents. Dataset: https://huggingface.co/FinWorkBench Full author list: Appendix A. Preprint.Frontier AI systems are increasingly transforming professional workspaces. AI-assisted tools like ChatGPT [41], Claude [2], Gemini [21], and Copilot [39] are now embedded in daily enterprise workflowshelping professionals draft documents, explore data, manipulate spreadsheets, and generate reports. These tools are particularly impactful in finance and accounting (F&A), highstakes, knowledgeand labor-intensive domain critical to every organization. However, real-world F&A work is inherently messy with substantial contextual complexity: artifacts are interconnected across heterogeneous spreadsheets, PDFs, and more, evolving through multiple versions with collaborative edits [28]; spreadsheets contain large, complex structures [17] with cross-sheet references, intricate layouts, inconsistent formatting, cryptic terms, erroneous formulas, and multimodal artifacts such as charts, images, and code. It is also long-horizon [42]: workflows demand multi-step reasoning spanning data entry, editing, retrieval, calculation, modeling, validation, reporting, and more. This raises key question: Can todays frontier AI agents actually handle the messy, long-horizon, and knowledge-intensive workflows that professionals face daily? To answer this, we introduce FINCH, an enterprise-grade F&A benchmark sourced from authentic enterprise environments. FINCH captures the intrinsic complexity of professional work through: In-the-wild enterprise sourcing: FINCH is built around authentic enterprise spreadsheets, emails, and PDFs from real-world enterprise workspacesprimarily Enron [19] (about 15,000 spreadsheet files and 500,000 emails from 150 executives and employees) and EUSES [20] (about 450 financial spreadsheets from various sources), along with securities and asset management firms, global organizations such as World Bank [4], and Canadian and British governments [11, 24]. Documents are large, cross-referenced, and messy containing rich multimodal artifacts such as tables, formulas, charts, pivots, and images. Rigorous construction process: We propose novel workflow construction pipeline grounded in real collaborative context of emails and versioned artifacts. We induce workflows from enterprise email threads and attachments, where collaborators naturally describe, discuss, and track workflows as part of their daily work. And we propose an LLM-assisted, expert-verified method to derive workflows by analyzing changes across versioned spreadsheets, surfacing the underlying goals that drive professionals work. Annotators must reason over large multi-sheet workbooks, and subtle version deltas to infer what the original analyst was trying to achieve, making the annotation process substantially more difficult than curating QA pairs over isolated tables. We compile 172 meticulously annotated, enterprise-grade workflows built on 1,710 spreadsheets, along with PDFs and other artifacts, collectively capturing the compositional, messy, knowledgeintensive, and collaborative nature of real work. Each workflow spans one or more interdependent tasksdata entry, editing, retrieval, calculation, modeling, validation, translation, visualization, and reportingmirroring how professionals actually work on artifact manipulation and creation. Figure 2: Model pass-rate comparison on FINCH workflows. Bars show overall workflow success rates for product-side agents and API-based models. Detailed settings can be found in Section 3. We evaluate spectrum of frontier AI systemsincluding Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT 5.1, Gemini 3, Grok 4, and Qwen 3using both expert evaluation and novel automated evaluation pipeline that closely aligns with expert judgments. Our experiments reveal that even the frontier agents pass only fewer than 40% of workflows (GPT 5.1 Pro spends 16.8 minutes per workflow on average), highlighting the substantial challenges that FINCH poses for AI agents. Comprehensive case analyses further surface concrete challenges that real-world enterprise workflows pose for AI agents. 2 Figure 3: Illustration of an end-to-end predictive modeling workflow commonly performed by financial analysts. The workflow involves multiple steps, including web search, data import, crosssheet and cross-file retrieval, calculation and financial modeling, visualization, and report generation.

Our user study (for spatial correctness and temporal coherence) shows that the reconstructions obtained using the proposed attention mixing mechanism are clearly preferred over the baseline without mixing (B).

Finch, a benchmark for AI agents in enterprise finance and accounting, evaluates performance across complex, real-world workflows using authentic data from Enron and other institutions.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce a finance & accounting benchmark (Finch) for evaluating AI agents on real-world, enterprise-grade professional workflows -- interleaving data entry, structuring, formatting, web search, cross-file retrieval, calculation, modeling, validation, translation, visualization, and reporting. Finch is sourced from authentic enterprise workspaces at Enron (15,000 spreadsheets and 500,000 emails from 150 employees) and other financial institutions, preserving in-the-wild messiness across multimodal artifacts (text, tables, formulas, charts, code, and images) and spanning diverse domains such as budgeting, trading, and asset management.   We propose a workflow construction process that combines LLM-assisted discovery with expert annotation: (1) LLM-assisted, expert-verified derivation of workflows from real-world email threads and version histories of spreadsheet files, and (2) meticulous expert annotation for workflows, requiring over 700 hours of domain-expert effort. This yields 172 composite workflows with 384 tasks, involving 1,710 spreadsheets with 27 million cells, along with PDFs and other artifacts, capturing the intrinsically messy, long-horizon, knowledge-intensive, and collaborative nature of real-world enterprise work.   We conduct both human and automated evaluations of frontier AI systems including GPT 5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok 4, and Qwen 3 Max, and GPT 5.1 Pro spends 48 hours in total yet passes only 38.4% of workflows, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 passes just 25.0%. Comprehensive case studies further surface the challenges that real-world enterprise workflows pose for AI agents.

COM4D predicts the structure and spatio-temporal configuration of 4D/3D objects from 2D video without using 4D compositional training data, achieving state-of-the-art results in 4D object and composed 3D reconstruction.  					AI-generated summary 				 Scenes in the real world are often composed of several static and dynamic objects. Capturing their 4-dimensional structures, composition and spatio-temporal configuration in-the-wild, though extremely interesting, is equally hard. Therefore, existing works often focus on one object at a time, while relying on some category-specific parametric shape model for dynamic objects. This can lead to inconsistent scene configurations, in addition to being limited to the modeled object categories. We propose COM4D (Compositional 4D), a method that consistently and jointly predicts the structure and spatio-temporal configuration of 4D/3D objects using only static multi-object or dynamic single object supervision. We achieve this by a carefully designed training of spatial and temporal attentions on 2D video input. The training is disentangled into learning from object compositions on the one hand, and single object dynamics throughout the video on the other, thus completely avoiding reliance on 4D compositional training data. At inference time, our proposed attention mixing mechanism combines these independently learned attentions, without requiring any 4D composition examples. By alternating between spatial and temporal reasoning, COM4D reconstructs complete and persistent 4D scenes with multiple interacting objects directly from monocular videos. Furthermore, COM4D provides state-of-the-art results in existing separate problems of 4D object and composed 3D reconstruction despite being purely data-driven.
