Text:"GenieDrive: Towards Physics-Aware Driving World Model with 4D Occupancy Guided Video Generation Zhenya Yang1, Zhe Liu1, Yuxiang Lu1, Liping Hou2, Chenxuan Miao1, Siyi Peng2, Bailan Feng2, Xiang Bai3, Hengshuang Zhao1(cid:66) 1The University of Hong Kong, 2 Huawei Noahs Ark Lab, 3Huazhong University of Science and Technology 5 2 0 2 4 1 ] . [ 1 1 5 7 2 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r Figure 1. (a) Overview of our GenieDrive. It predicts physically accurate future occupancy given the initial state and driving controls, and renders the occupancy into video, enabling physics-aware multi-view driving video generation. (b) and (c) Performance of 4D occupancy forecasting and video generation. GenieDrive achieves the highest occupancy forecasting accuracy using the fewest parameters (bubble size denotes model size) and facilitates 8 longer multi-view driving video generation with notably enhanced generation quality.

GenieDrive uses a 4D occupancy-based approach with a VAE and Mutual Control Attention for physics-aware driving video generation, improving forecasting accuracy and video quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Physics-aware driving world model is essential for drive planning, out-of-distribution data synthesis, and closed-loop evaluation. However, existing methods often rely on a single diffusion model to directly map driving actions to videos, which makes learning difficult and leads to physically inconsistent outputs. To overcome these challenges, we propose GenieDrive, a novel framework designed for physics-aware driving video generation. Our approach starts by generating 4D occupancy, which serves as a physics-informed foundation for subsequent video generation. 4D occupancy contains rich physical information, including high-resolution 3D structures and dynamics. To facilitate effective compression of such high-resolution occupancy, we propose a VAE that encodes occupancy into a latent tri-plane representation, reducing the latent size to only 58% of that used in previous methods. We further introduce Mutual Control Attention (MCA) to accurately model the influence of control on occupancy evolution, and we jointly train the VAE and the subsequent prediction module in an end-to-end manner to maximize forecasting accuracy. Together, these designs yield a 7.2% improvement in forecasting mIoU at an inference speed of 41 FPS, while using only 3.47 M parameters. Additionally, a Normalized Multi-View Attention is introduced in the video generation model to generate multi-view driving videos with guidance from our 4D occupancy, significantly improving video quality with a 20.7% reduction in FVD. Experiments demonstrate that GenieDrive enables highly controllable, multi-view consistent, and physics-aware driving video generation.

**Reasoning:**

1. **DIFFUSION**: The paper explicitly mentions "diffusion model" in the context of driving video generation, discussing how existing methods rely on diffusion models to map driving actions to videos.

2. **OPTIMIZATION**: The paper presents optimization improvements including a VAE for compression (reducing latent size to 58%), Mutual Control Attention for better modeling, end-to-end training, and achieves performance improvements (7.2% improvement in forecasting mIoU, 20.7% reduction in FVD) with efficient parameters (3.47M).

FIN-bench-v2 is a unified benchmark suite for evaluating Finnish large language models, incorporating diverse datasets and evaluation criteria.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce FIN-bench-v2, a unified benchmark suite for evaluating large language models in Finnish. FIN-bench-v2 consolidates Finnish versions of widely used benchmarks together with an updated and expanded version of the original FIN-bench into a single, consistently formatted collection, covering multiple-choice and generative tasks across reading comprehension, commonsense reasoning, sentiment analysis, world knowledge, and alignment. All datasets are converted to HuggingFace Datasets, which include both cloze and multiple-choice prompt formulations with five variants per task, and we incorporate human annotation or review for machine-translated resources such as GoldenSwag and XED. To select robust tasks, we pretrain a set of 2.15B-parameter decoder-only models and use their learning curves to compute monotonicity, signal-to-noise, non-random performance, and model ordering consistency, retaining only tasks that satisfy all criteria. We further evaluate a set of larger instruction-tuned models to characterize performance across tasks and prompt formulations. All datasets, prompts, and evaluation configurations are publicly available via our fork of the Language Model Evaluation Harness at https://github.com/LumiOpen/lm-evaluation-harness. Supplementary resources are released in a separate repository at https://github.com/TurkuNLP/FIN-bench-v2.

The State over Tokens (SoT) framework reinterprets reasoning tokens in large language models as computational states rather than linguistic narratives, highlighting the need for a new focus in research.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate reasoning tokens before their final answer to boost performance on complex tasks. While these sequences seem like human thought processes, empirical evidence reveals that they are not a faithful explanation of the model's actual reasoning process. To address this gap between appearance and function, we introduce the State over Tokens (SoT) conceptual framework. SoT reframes reasoning tokens not as a linguistic narrative, but as an externalized computational state -- the sole persistent information carrier across the model's stateless generation cycles. This explains how the tokens can drive correct reasoning without being a faithful explanation when read as text and surfaces previously overlooked research questions on these tokens. We argue that to truly understand the process that LLMs do, research must move beyond reading the reasoning tokens as text and focus on decoding them as state.

This represents a new perspective on neural architecture components and how information flows through language models.

- **TRAINING**: The paper discusses reasoning tokens generated during model inference/generation as part of the model's computational process, and addresses how these tokens relate to model performance on complex tasks, which connects to understanding and improving how models process information during generation.
