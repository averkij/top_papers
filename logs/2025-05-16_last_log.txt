Text:"5 2 0 2 4 1 ] . [ 1 4 9 6 9 0 . 5 0 5 2 : r EWMBENCH: Evaluating Scene, Motion, and Semantic Quality in Embodied World Models Hu Yue1,4, Siyuan Huang2, Yue Liao3 Shengcong Chen1 Pengfei Zhou1 Liliang Chen1, Maoqing Yao1, Guanghui Ren1,Recent advances in creative AI have enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images and videos conditioned on language instructions. Building on these developments, text-to-video diffusion models have evolved into embodied world models (EWMs) capable of generating physically plausible scenes from language commands, effectively bridging vision and action in embodied AI applications. This work addresses the critical challenge of evaluating EWMs beyond general perceptual metrics to ensure the generation of physically grounded and action-consistent behaviors. We propose the Embodied World Model Benchmark (EWMBENCH), dedicated framework designed to evaluate EWMs based on three key aspects: visual scene consistency, motion correctness, and semantic alignment. Our approach leverages meticulously curated dataset encompassing diverse scenes and motion patterns, alongside comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation toolkit, to assess and compare candidate models. The proposed benchmark not only identifies the limitations of existing video generation models in meeting the unique requirements of embodied tasks but also provides valuable insights to guide future advancements in the field. The dataset and evaluation tools are publicly available at https://github.com/AgibotTech/EWMBench.Figure 1: Comparison between general video generation and embodied video generation. Unlike general videos, embodied videos typically feature more structured scenes, consistent motion patterns, and clearer task logic. *Equal contribution. Project leader. Corresponding authors. 1AgiBot. 2SJTU. 3MMLab-CUHK. 4HIT. Preprint. Creative AI has advanced rapidly in recent years, propelled by innovations in model architecturessuch as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and diffusion modelsincreased parameter scaling, and the availability of large-scale, high-quality datasets. These developments have empowered generative models to synthesize images and videos conditioned on language instructions with unprecedented fidelity and controllability. Building on the momentum of text-to-video diffusion models, recent efforts have expanded their scope from generating high-fidelity, high-resolution videos to serving as embodied world models (EWMs) capable of synthesizing physically actionable scenes from language instructions (e.g., move the robot arm approaching the cup) or physical action instructions, i.e., an action policy sequence. This emerging capability establishes critical link between vision and action in embodied AI, facilitating applications such as robotic manipulation, where instruction-conditioned trajectories must conform to physical and kinematic constraints. Despite advancements in EWMs, fundamental question remains unresolved: How can we determine whether video generation model qualifies as good embodied world model, beyond merely serving as general-purpose video generator? Addressing this question is essential for guiding model development and assessing models ability to produce physically grounded, action-consistent behaviors. While existing video generation benchmarks Huang et al. [2024a] focus on perceptual metrics like visual fidelity, language alignment, and human preference, these criteria are insufficient for evaluating EWMs. Embodied generation tasks have unique requirements, such as coherence in embodiment motion and plausibility in action execution, as illustrated in Figure 1. For instance, in robotic manipulation scenarios, the background, object configuration, and embodiment structure (e.g., robot morphology) are expected to remain static, while only the robots pose and interactions evolve according to instructions. This structured realism sets EWMs apart from general video generators and demands evaluation beyond conventional criteria. In this work, we introduce dedicated benchmark, Embodied World Model Benchmark (EWMBENCH), to systematically assess embodiment motion fidelity and spatiotemporal consistency in robotic manipulation. We first formalize the benchmarking setup for EWMs. Given an initial video segment that specifies the embodiment (e.g., robotic arm) and the environment, along with manipulation instruction, the candidate EWM is tasked with autoregressively generating future frames depicting the embodiments motion until the instruction is completed. We design an evaluation protocol based on three key aspects: (1) Visual Scene Consistency, ensuring static elements like the background, objects, and embodiment structure remain unchanged during motion; (2) Motion Correctness, requiring the generated embodiment trajectory to be coherent and aligned with the task objective; and (3) Semantic Alignment and Diversity, assessing the models alignment with linguistic instructions and its ability to generalize across diverse tasks. For these aspects, we develop systematic evaluation tools, including prompt engineering with video-based MLLMs. To benchmark EWMs under our proposed criteria, we construct comprehensive colosseum consisting of curated benchmark dataset and open-source evaluation tools. The dataset is built on AgibotWorld AgiBot [2024], the largest real-world robotic manipulation dataset, featuring diverse tasks at scale. We select 30 candidate samples across ten tasks with clear action-ordering constraints, where correct execution requires understanding logical dependencies and affordancesposing significant challenges for embodied video generation. For each sample, static initial frames are clipped to ensure subsequent frames strictly reflect annotated language instructions without redundant movements. To reflect task diversity, we account for cases where multiple trajectories achieve the same goal and incorporate voxelized scoring to encourage variation. With this dataset, initial frames and language instructions are fed into different video generators, and the generated videos are compared against ground truth (GT) using various metrics. Contributions: We summarize our contributions as follows: (1) We propose the first world generation benchmark tailored for embodied tasks, EWMBENCH. (2)We curate high-quality, diverse dataset for our benchmark evaluation. (3) We introduce and open-source the systematical evaluation metrics, which covers key aspects in the embodied "

Large reasoning models (LRMs) already possess a latent capacity for long chain-of-thought reasoning. Prior work has shown that outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) can incidentally elicit advanced reasoning behaviors such as self-correction, backtracking, and verification phenomena often referred to as the model's "aha moment". However, the timing and consistency of these emergent behaviors remain unpredictable and uncontrollable, limiting the scalability and reliability of LRMs' reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we move beyond reliance on prompts and coincidental "aha moments". Instead, we explicitly align models with three meta-abilities: deduction, induction, and abduction, using automatically generated, self-verifiable tasks. Our three stage-pipeline individual alignment, parameter-space merging, and domain-specific reinforcement learning, boosting performance by over 10\% relative to instruction-tuned baselines. Furthermore, domain-specific RL from the aligned checkpoint yields an additional 2\% average gain in the performance ceiling across math, coding, and science benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit meta-ability alignment offers a scalable and dependable foundation for reasoning.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, with optimizing their input prompts playing a pivotal role in maximizing their performance. However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized, applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved performance.

Recent advances in creative AI have enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images and videos conditioned on language instructions. Building on these developments, text-to-video diffusion models have evolved into embodied world models (EWMs) capable of generating physically plausible scenes from language commands, effectively bridging vision and action in embodied AI applications. This work addresses the critical challenge of evaluating EWMs beyond general perceptual metrics to ensure the generation of physically grounded and action-consistent behaviors. We propose the Embodied World Model Benchmark (EWMBench), a dedicated framework designed to evaluate EWMs based on three key aspects: visual scene consistency, motion correctness, and semantic alignment. Our approach leverages a meticulously curated dataset encompassing diverse scenes and motion patterns, alongside a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation toolkit, to assess and compare candidate models. The proposed benchmark not only identifies the limitations of existing video generation models in meeting the unique requirements of embodied tasks but also provides valuable insights to guide future advancements in the field. The dataset and evaluation tools are publicly available at https://github.com/AgibotTech/EWMBench.

While humans can flexibly leverage interactive visual cognition for complex problem-solving, enabling Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to learn similarly adaptive behaviors with visual tools remains challenging. A significant hurdle is the current lack of standardized infrastructure, which hinders integrating diverse tools, generating rich interaction data, and training robust agents effectively. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenThinkIMG, the first open-source, comprehensive end-to-end framework for tool-augmented LVLMs. It features standardized vision tool interfaces, scalable trajectory generation for policy initialization, and a flexible training environment. Furthermore, considering supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on static demonstrations offers limited policy generalization for dynamic tool invocation, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework V-ToolRL to train LVLMs to learn adaptive policies for invoking external vision tools. V-ToolRL enables LVLMs to autonomously discover optimal tool-usage strategies by directly optimizing for task success using feedback from tool interactions. We empirically validate V-ToolRL on challenging chart reasoning tasks. Our RL-trained agent, built upon a Qwen2-VL-2B, significantly outperforms its SFT-initialized counterpart (+28.83 points) and surpasses established supervised tool-learning baselines like Taco and CogCom by an average of +12.7 points. Notably, it also surpasses prominent closed-source models like GPT-4.1 by +8.68 accuracy points. We hope OpenThinkIMG can serve as a foundational framework for advancing dynamic, tool-augmented visual reasoning, helping the community develop AI agents that can genuinely "think with images".

Existing vision tokenization isolates the optimization of vision tokenizers from downstream training, implicitly assuming the visual tokens can generalize well across various tasks, e.g., image generation and visual question answering. The vision tokenizer optimized for low-level reconstruction is agnostic to downstream tasks requiring varied representations and semantics. This decoupled paradigm introduces a critical misalignment: The loss of the vision tokenization can be the representation bottleneck for target tasks. For example, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when recognizing or generating them. To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision tokenization and target autoregressive tasks. Unlike prior autoregressive models that use only discrete indices from a frozen vision tokenizer, ETT leverages the visual embeddings of the tokenizer codebook, and optimizes the vision tokenizers end-to-end with both reconstruction and caption objectives. ETT can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal architecture modifications. Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate, without the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the employed large language models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning unlocks significant performance gains, i.e., 2-6% for multimodal understanding and visual generation tasks compared to frozen tokenizer baselines, while preserving the original reconstruction capability. We hope this very simple and strong method can empower multimodal foundation models besides image generation and understanding.

"This paper does not describe a new method; instead, it provides a thorough exploration of an important yet understudied design space related to recent advances in text-to-image synthesis -- specifically, the deep fusion of large language models (LLMs) and diffusion transformers (DiTs) for multi-modal generation. Previous studies mainly focused on overall system performance rather than detailed comparisons with alternative methods, and key design details and training recipes were often left undisclosed. These gaps create uncertainty about the real potential of this approach. To fill these gaps, we conduct an empirical study on text-to-image generation, performing controlled comparisons with established baselines, analyzing important design choices, and providing a clear, reproducible recipe for training at scale. We hope this work offers meaningful data points and practical guidelines for future research in multi-modal generation."
