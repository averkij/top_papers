Keywords: World Model, Video Generation, Data EngineThe development of robotic imitation learning has significantly advanced robotic manipulation, transitioning the field from solving isolated tasks in static environments to addressing complex and diverse interaction scenarios. Unlike traditional AI domains such as computer vision (CV) or natural language processing (NLP), where model performance can be evaluated using non-interactive and static datasets, robotic manipulation inherently requires real-time interaction between agents and dynamic environments during testing and evaluation. As task diversity grows, assessing policy performance often necessitates direct deployment on physical robots or the creation of large-scale 3D simulation environmentsboth of which are costly, labor-intensive, and challenging to scale. Building low-cost, scalable testing and inference environments for robotic manipulation has thus become critical challenge in robotic imitation learning. Recently, the concept of using video generation models as world simulators has emerged as promising direction. These models enable agents to observe and interact with dynamic worlds through learned visual dynamics, circumventing the need for explicit physical simulation. While this approach introduces new avenue for constructing robotic inference pipelines, existing world modeling techniques primarily focus on generating videos from language instructions and predicting actions based on the generated videos. However, these methods fall short of creating true world simulators, which should simulate environment dynamics in response to the agents actions, enabling realistic and controllable testing. *Equal contribution. Project leader. Corresponding authors. 1AgiBot. 2SJTU. 3MMLab-CUHK Figure 1: Overview of the EVAC framework. Given initial observation images and an action sequence, EVAC generates multi-view videos conditioned on the provided actions. By incorporating memory mechanism, EVAC supports the generation of long-term video sequences. The framework handles both static head camera views and dynamic wrist camera views to provide comprehensive representation of the robotic environment. To bridge this gap, we propose EVAC, an action-conditional world model that generates future visual observations directly conditioned on the agents predicted actions. Built upon prior embodied world model architectures like EnerVerse [1], ENERVERSE-AC incorporates additional ActionConditioning information to enable more realistic and controllable robotic inference. To achieve this, we designed multi-level action condition injection mechanism, which uses end-effector projection action maps and delta action encodings. Furthermore, to support the generation of multi-view images, crucial for embodied tasks, we introduce spatial cross-attention modules and ray direction map encoding to process multi-view features. To reflect the movement of camera, we encode the cameras motion using ray map embeddings. Beyond architectural innovations, the EVAC world model is designed to handle both successful and failure scenarios. In addition to leveraging the Agibot-World dataset [2], we curated diverse dataset of failure trajectories, significantly expanding the training datas coverage. This enhancement improves the models ability to generalize across diverse scenarios, ensuring its applicability to real-world robotics tasks. The proposed EVAC world model serves as both data engine for policy learning and an evaluator for trained policy models, addressing key challenges in robotic manipulation. As data engine, EVAC augments limited human-collected trajectories into diverse datasets by segmenting actions (e.g., fetch, grasp, home), applying spatial augmentations, and generating new video sequences, thereby enhancing policy robustness and generalization. As an evaluator, it eliminates the need for complex simulation assets by generating realistic, action-conditioned video observations for iterative policy testing, which can be reviewed by human evaluators or automated systems like Video-MLLMs. This approach significantly reduces reliance on real robot hardware during development, saving costs and time, while maintaining high evaluation fidelity correlated with real-world performance.Video Generation Model as World Model. While prior research on generative models has shown promise, [3, 4] highlights video generation as an innovative approach to constructing world models. 2 Similarly, [5] aims to develop universal world model built upon the generative model but focuses on generating only the next-step frames rather than continuous video sequences. Video generation remains challenging task with applications across diverse domains. Recent advancements in diffusion models [6] and latent diffusion models [7] have demonstrated progress in generating highquality images with reduced computational complexity. Furthermore, text-guided and pose-guided video generation methods [8, 9] have expanded the appli"

[ 1 1 8 5 8 0 . 5 0 5 2 : r ReSurgSAM2: Referring Segment Anything in Surgical Video via Credible Long-term Tracking Haofeng Liu1, Mingqi Gao2, Xuxiao Luo1, Ziyue Wang1, Guanyi Qin1, Junde Wu3, and Yueming Jin1((cid:66)) 1 National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore 2 Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China 3 University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom haofeng.liu@u.nus.edu, ymjin@nus.edu.sg Abstract. Surgical scene segmentation is critical in computer-assisted surgery and is vital for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, referring surgical segmentation is emerging, given its advantage of providing surgeons with an interactive experience to segment the target object. However, existing methods are limited by low efficiency and short-term tracking, hindering their applicability in complex realworld surgical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce ReSurgSAM2, twostage surgical referring segmentation framework that leverages Segment Anything Model 2 to perform text-referred target detection, followed by tracking with reliable initial frame identification and diversity-driven long-term memory. For the detection stage, we propose cross-modal spatial-temporal Mamba to generate precise detection and segmentation results. Based on these results, our credible initial frame selection strategy identifies the reliable frame for the subsequent tracking. Upon selecting the initial frame, our method transitions to the tracking stage, where it incorporates diversity-driven memory mechanism that maintains credible and diverse memory bank, ensuring consistent long-term tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReSurgSAM2 achieves substantial improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods, operating in real-time at 61.2 FPS.

Robotic imitation learning has advanced from solving static tasks to addressing dynamic interaction scenarios, but testing and evaluation remain costly and challenging due to the need for real-time interaction with dynamic environments. We propose EnerVerse-AC (EVAC), an action-conditional world model that generates future visual observations based on an agent's predicted actions, enabling realistic and controllable robotic inference. Building on prior architectures, EVAC introduces a multi-level action-conditioning mechanism and ray map encoding for dynamic multi-view image generation while expanding training data with diverse failure trajectories to improve generalization. As both a data engine and evaluator, EVAC augments human-collected trajectories into diverse datasets and generates realistic, action-conditioned video observations for policy testing, eliminating the need for physical robots or complex simulations. This approach significantly reduces costs while maintaining high fidelity in robotic manipulation evaluation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. Code, checkpoints, and datasets can be found at <https://annaj2178.github.io/EnerverseAC.github.io>.

Surgical scene segmentation is critical in computer-assisted surgery and is vital for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, referring surgical segmentation is emerging, given its advantage of providing surgeons with an interactive experience to segment the target object. However, existing methods are limited by low efficiency and short-term tracking, hindering their applicability in complex real-world surgical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce ReSurgSAM2, a two-stage surgical referring segmentation framework that leverages Segment Anything Model 2 to perform text-referred target detection, followed by tracking with reliable initial frame identification and diversity-driven long-term memory. For the detection stage, we propose a cross-modal spatial-temporal Mamba to generate precise detection and segmentation results. Based on these results, our credible initial frame selection strategy identifies the reliable frame for the subsequent tracking. Upon selecting the initial frame, our method transitions to the tracking stage, where it incorporates a diversity-driven memory mechanism that maintains a credible and diverse memory bank, ensuring consistent long-term tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReSurgSAM2 achieves substantial improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods, operating in real-time at 61.2 FPS. Our code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/ReSurgSAM2.
