Introduction 5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 7 5 6 3 1 . 3 0 5 2 : r Despite growing enthusiasm for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where multiple LLM agents collaborate to accomplish tasks, their performance gains across popular benchmarks remain minimal compared to single-agent frameworks. This gap highlights the need to analyze the challenges hindering MAS effectiveness. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of MAS challenges. We analyze five popular MAS frameworks across over 150 tasks, involving six expert human annotators. We identify 14 unique failure modes and propose comprehensive taxonomy applicable to various MAS frameworks. This taxonomy emerges iteratively from agreements among three expert annotators per study, achieving Cohens Kappa score of 0.88. These fine-grained failure modes are organized into 3 categories: (i) specification and system design failures, (ii) inter-agent misalignment, and (iii) task verification and termination. To support scalable evaluation, we integrate MASFT with LLM-as-a-Judge. We also explore if identified failures could be easily prevented by proposing two interventions: improved specification of agent roles and enhanced orchestration strategies. Our findings reveal that identified failures require more complex solutions, highlighting clear roadmap for future research. We open-source our dataset and LLM annotator 1.

Correspondence to: Mert Cemri <cemri@berkeley.edu>, Melissa Pan <melissapan@berkeley.edu>. 1https://github.com/multi-agent-systems-failuretaxonomy/MASFT 1 Recently, Large Language Model (LLM) based agentic systems have gained significant attention in the AI community (Patil et al., 2023; Packer et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a). This growing interest comes from the ability of agentic systems to handle complex, multi-step tasks while dynamically interacting with diverse environments, making LLM-based agentic systems well-suited for real-world problems (Li et al., 2023). Building on this characteristic, multi-agent systems are increasingly explored in various domains, such as software engineering (Qian et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024d), drug discoveries (Gottweis et al., 2025; Swanson et al., 2024), scientific simulations (Park et al., 2023b), and recently general-purpose agent (Liang et al., 2025). Figure 1. Failure rates of five popular Multi-Agent LLM Systems with GPT-4o and Claude-3. Although the formal definition of agents remains topic of debate (Cheng et al., 2024; Xi et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2024b), in this study, we define LLM-based agent as an artificial entity with prompt specifications (initial state), conversation trace (state), and ability to interact with the environments such as tool usage (action). multi-agent system (MAS) is then defined as collection of agents designed to interact through orchestration, enabling collective intelligence. MASs are structured to coordinate efforts, enabling task decomposition, performance parallelization, context isolation, specialized model ensembling, and diverse reasoning discussions (He et al., 2024b; Mandi et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Du et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023a; Guo et al., 2024a). Why Do Multi-Agent LLM Systems Fail? Figure 2. Taxonomy of MAS Failure Modes. The inter-agent conversation stages indicate when failure can occur in the end-to-end MAS system. If failure mode spans multiple stages, it means the issue involves or can occur at different stages. Percentages represent how frequently each failure mode and category appeared in our analysis of 151 traces. Detailed definition and example of each failure mode is available in Appendix A. Despite increasing adoption of MAS, the gain in accuracy or performance remains minimal compared to single agent frameworks (Xia et al., 2024) or even simple baselines such as best-of-N sampling on popular benchmarks (Kapoor et al., 2024). Our empirical analysis reveals that the correctness of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source MAS, ChatDev (Qian et al., 2023), can be as low as 25%, as shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, there is no clear consensus on how to build robust and reliable MASs. This leads to fundamental question that we need to answer first: Why do MASs fail? To understand MAS failure modes, we conduct the first systematic evaluation of MAS execution traces using Grounded Theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). We analyze five popular open-source MASs, employing six expert annotators to identify fine-grained issues across 150 conversation traces, each averaging over 15,000 lines of text. We define failures as cases where the MAS does not achieve the intended task objectives. To ensure consistency in failure modes and definitions, three expert annotators independently label 15 traces, achieving an inter-annotator agreement with Cohens Kappa score of 0.88. From this comprehensive analysis, we identify 14 distinct failure modes, which we cluster into 3 primary failure categories. We introduce the Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (MASFT), the first structured failure taxonomy of MAS, as illustrated in Fig. 2. We do not claim MASFT covers every potential failure pattern; rather, it serves as the first step towards taxonomizing and understanding MAS failures. To enable scalable automated evaluation, we introduce an LLM-as-a-judge pipeline (Zheng et al., 2023) that uses OpenAIs o1. To validate this pipeline, we cross-verify its annotations against three human expert annotations on 10 traces, obtaining final Cohens Kappa agreement rate of 0.77. Intuitively, better specifications (Stoica et al., 2024a) and prompting strategies could potentially mitigate MAS failures. To test this hypothesis, we implement best-effort interventions using prompt engineering and enhanced agent topological orchestration. Our case study with AG2 (Wu et al., 2024a) and ChatDev (Qian et al., 2023) reveals that although these interventions yield +14% improvement for ChatDev, they do not resolve all failure cases. Moreover, th"

Despite growing enthusiasm for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where multiple LLM agents collaborate to accomplish tasks, their performance gains across popular benchmarks remain minimal compared to single-agent frameworks. This gap highlights the need to analyze the challenges hindering MAS effectiveness.   In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of MAS challenges. We analyze five popular MAS frameworks across over 150 tasks, involving six expert human annotators. We identify 14 unique failure modes and propose a comprehensive taxonomy applicable to various MAS frameworks. This taxonomy emerges iteratively from agreements among three expert annotators per study, achieving a Cohen's Kappa score of 0.88. These fine-grained failure modes are organized into 3 categories, (i) specification and system design failures, (ii) inter-agent misalignment, and (iii) task verification and termination. To support scalable evaluation, we integrate MASFT with LLM-as-a-Judge. We also explore if identified failures could be easily prevented by proposing two interventions: improved specification of agent roles and enhanced orchestration strategies. Our findings reveal that identified failures require more complex solutions, highlighting a clear roadmap for future research. We open-source our dataset and LLM annotator.

Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) typically relies on massive computational resources and extensive datasets, limiting accessibility for resource-constrained settings. Our study investigates the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning in small LLMs, focusing on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, under strict constraints: training on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs (48 GB VRAM each) within 24 hours. Adapting the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curating a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, we conducted three experiments to explore model behavior and performance. Our results demonstrate rapid reasoning gains - e.g., AMC23 accuracy rising from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing o1-preview - using only 7,000 samples and a $42 training cost, compared to thousands of dollars for baseline models. However, challenges such as optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. These findings highlight the efficacy of RL-based fine-tuning for small LLMs, offering a cost-effective alternative to large-scale approaches. We release our code and datasets as open-source resources, providing insights into trade-offs and laying a foundation for scalable, reasoning-capable LLMs in resource-limited environments.

Popular video training methods mainly operate on a fixed number of tokens sampled from a predetermined spatiotemporal grid, resulting in sub-optimal accuracy-computation trade-offs due to inherent video redundancy. They also lack adaptability to varying computational budgets for downstream tasks, hindering applications of the most competitive model in real-world scenes. We thus propose a new test setting, Token Optimization, for maximized input information across budgets, which optimizes the size-limited set of input tokens through token selection from more suitably sampled videos. To this end, we propose a novel augmentation tool termed Flux. By making the sampling grid flexible and leveraging token selection, it is easily adopted in most popular video training frameworks, boosting model robustness with nearly no additional cost. We integrate Flux in large-scale video pre-training, and the resulting FluxViT establishes new state-of-the-art results across extensive tasks at standard costs. Notably, with 1/4 tokens only, it can still match the performance of previous state-of-the-art models with Token Optimization, yielding nearly 90\% savings. All models and data are available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/FluxViT.

In this paper, we explore the task of generating expansive outdoor scenes, ranging from castles to high-rises. Unlike indoor scene generation, which has been a primary focus of prior work, outdoor scene generation presents unique challenges, including wide variations in scene heights and the need for a method capable of rapidly producing large landscapes. To address this, we propose an efficient approach that encodes scene chunks as uniform vector sets, offering better compression and performance than the spatially structured latents used in prior methods. Furthermore, we train an explicit outpainting model for unbounded generation, which improves coherence compared to prior resampling-based inpainting schemes while also speeding up generation by eliminating extra diffusion steps. To facilitate this task, we curate NuiScene43, a small but high-quality set of scenes, preprocessed for joint training. Notably, when trained on scenes of varying styles, our model can blend different environments, such as rural houses and city skyscrapers, within the same scene, highlighting the potential of our curation process to leverage heterogeneous scenes for joint training.

Video large language models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated the capability to process longer video inputs and enable complex reasoning and analysis. However, due to the thousands of visual tokens from the video frames, key-value (KV) cache can significantly increase memory requirements, becoming a bottleneck for inference speed and memory usage. KV cache quantization is a widely used approach to address this problem. In this paper, we find that 2-bit KV quantization of VideoLLMs can hardly hurt the model performance, while the limit of KV cache quantization in even lower bits has not been investigated. To bridge this gap, we introduce VidKV, a plug-and-play KV cache quantization method to compress the KV cache to lower than 2 bits. Specifically, (1) for key, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy in the channel dimension, where we perform 2-bit quantization for anomalous channels and 1-bit quantization combined with FFT for normal channels; (2) for value, we implement 1.58-bit quantization while selectively filtering semantically salient visual tokens for targeted preservation, for a better trade-off between precision and model performance. Importantly, our findings suggest that the value cache of VideoLLMs should be quantized in a per-channel fashion instead of the per-token fashion proposed by prior KV cache quantization works for LLMs. Empirically, extensive results with LLaVA-OV-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on six benchmarks show that VidKV effectively compresses the KV cache to 1.5-bit and 1.58-bit precision with almost no performance drop compared to the FP16 counterparts.

We propose VideoRFSplat, a direct text-to-3D model leveraging a video generation model to generate realistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for unbounded real-world scenes. To generate diverse camera poses and unbounded spatial extent of real-world scenes, while ensuring generalization to arbitrary text prompts, previous methods fine-tune 2D generative models to jointly model camera poses and multi-view images. However, these methods suffer from instability when extending 2D generative models to joint modeling due to the modality gap, which necessitates additional models to stabilize training and inference. In this work, we propose an architecture and a sampling strategy to jointly model multi-view images and camera poses when fine-tuning a video generation model. Our core idea is a dual-stream architecture that attaches a dedicated pose generation model alongside a pre-trained video generation model via communication blocks, generating multi-view images and camera poses through separate streams. This design reduces interference between the pose and image modalities. Additionally, we propose an asynchronous sampling strategy that denoises camera poses faster than multi-view images, allowing rapidly denoised poses to condition multi-view generation, reducing mutual ambiguity and enhancing cross-modal consistency. Trained on multiple large-scale real-world datasets (RealEstate10K, MVImgNet, DL3DV-10K, ACID), VideoRFSplat outperforms existing text-to-3D direct generation methods that heavily depend on post-hoc refinement via score distillation sampling, achieving superior results without such refinement.

"We propose VideoRFSplat, a direct text-to-3D model leveraging a video generation model to generate realistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for unbounded real-world scenes. To generate diverse camera poses and unbounded spatial extent of real-world scenes, while ensuring generalization to arbitrary text prompts, previous methods fine-tune 2D generative models to jointly model camera poses and multi-view images. However, these methods suffer from instability when extending 2D generative models to joint modeling due to the modality gap, which necessitates additional models to stabilize training and inference. In this work, we propose an architecture and a sampling strategy to jointly model multi-view images and camera poses when fine-tuning a video generation model. Our core idea is a dual-stream architecture that attaches a dedicated pose generation model alongside a pre-trained video generation model via communication blocks, generating multi-view images and camera poses through separate streams. This design reduces interference between the pose and image modalities. Additionally, we propose an asynchronous sampling strategy that denoises camera poses faster than multi-view images, allowing rapidly denoised poses to condition multi-view generation, reducing mutual ambiguity and enhancing cross-modal consistency. Trained on multiple large-scale real-world datasets (RealEstate10K, MVImgNet, DL3DV-10K, ACID), VideoRFSplat outperforms existing text-to-3D direct generation methods that heavily depend on post-hoc refinement via score distillation sampling, achieving superior results without such refinement."

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks. Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2 reasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences improve performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due to verbose and redundant outputs, known as the "overthinking phenomenon". In this paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically investigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient reasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we categorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based efficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models into more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning models; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to dynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input prompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency based on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control. Additionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning models, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and discuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.
