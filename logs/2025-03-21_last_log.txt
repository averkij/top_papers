Text:"Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning 2025-3-21 NVIDIA5 2 0 2 8 1 ] . [ 1 8 5 5 5 1 . 3 0 5 2 : r Physical AI systems need to perceive, understand, and perform complex actions in the physical world. In this paper, we present the Cosmos-Reason1 models that can understand the physical world and generate appropriate embodied decisions (e.g., next step action) in natural language through long chain-of-thought reasoning processes. We begin by defining key capabilities for Physical AI reasoning, with focus on physical common sense and embodied reasoning. To represent physical common sense, we use hierarchical ontology that captures fundamental knowledge about space, time, and physics. For embodied reasoning, we rely on two-dimensional ontology that generalizes across different physical embodiments. Building on these capabilities, we develop two multimodal large language models, Cosmos-Reason1-8B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. We curate data and train our models in four stages: vision pre-training, general supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Physical AI SFT, and Physical AI reinforcement learning (RL) as the post-training. To evaluate our models, we build comprehensive benchmarks for physical common sense and embodied reasoning according to our ontologies. Evaluation results show that Physical AI SFT and reinforcement learning bring significant improvements. To facilitate the development of Physical AI, we will make our code and pre-trained models available under the NVIDIA Open Model License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1. 1. Introduction Physical AI systems are designed to interact with the physical world. To effectively follow instructions and take appropriate actions to achieve desired goal, they need to first perceive, understand, and reason about the physical world. Recently, with breakthroughs of post-training and test-time scaling via long chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general reasoning capabilities in tackling complex problems across domains such as coding and mathematics (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI, 2025). However, key limitation of these models lies in their ability to ground their knowledge in the physical world. While LLMs trained on vast amounts of textual data from the Internet may acquire essential knowledge to reason about the physical world, they often struggle to establish connections between that knowledge and real-world interactions and dynamics. In this paper, we begin by defining the fundamental capabilities essential for Physical AI systems. Unlike designing models that excel at solving coding and mathematical problems, our focus is on empowering models with physical common sense knowledge and embodied reasoning capabilities grounded in the real world. To establish shared framework and help measure progress, we propose two ontologies. First, hierarchical ontology that organizes physical common sense into three major categories Space, Time, and Fundamental Physics which are further divided into 16 fine-grained subcategories. This ontology encapsulates knowledge about how the physical world operates under the laws of physics and how it responds to interactions with embodied agents. Second, we introduce two-dimensional ontology for embodied reasoning, which encompasses four key reasoning capabilities across five types of embodied agents. Effective embodied reasoning based on physical common sense is crucial for understanding and planning actions that achieve specific objectives in the real world. The details are described in Sec. 2. 1A detailed list of contributors and acknowledgments can be found in App. of this paper. 2025 NVIDIA. All rights reserved. Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning Figure 1: An overview of Cosmos-Reason1. Cosmos-Reason1 contains two multimodal large language models of 8B and 56B, trained in four stages, including vision pre-training, general SFT, Physical AI SFT, and Physical AI RL. We also define two ontologies for physical common sense and embodied reasoning, and build three benchmarks to evaluate models Physical AI reasoning capabilities. We introduce Cosmos-Reason1 as step toward enabling multimodal LLMs to generate more physically grounded responses. We focus on the visual world, where the observations of the world are represented as videos. Cosmos-Reason1 perceives the physical world through video input, understands it, and reasons about it through long chain-of-thought thinking processes before generating responses. These responses, expressed in natural language, include both explanatory insights and embodied decisions, such as determining the next action to take. We employ decoder-only multimodal LLM architecture where the input video is processed by vision encoder followed by projector to align with the text token embeddings before feeding into the LLM. We adopt scalable, hybrid Mamba-MLP-Transformer architecture as the LLM backbone. Cosmos-Reason1 comes with two model sizes: Cosmos-Reason1-8B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. We describe details about the model architecture in Sec. 3. Data determines our models ceiling. To attain general capabilities, we curate large-scale and diverse data in the general vision domain, totaling 120M image, video, and interleaved data for vision pre-training, and 8M image and video data for general supervised fine-tuning. To strengthen our models physical common sense and embodied reasoning capabilities, we further design two pipelines to curate physical common sense and embodied reasoning data according to our ontologies. The data are curated based on human annotations and model distillation from DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025) for Physical AI supervised fine-tuning. Details about data are discussed in Sec. 4. Constructing rule-based, verifiable rewards at scale has been critical for the reasoning LLMs success in solving math and coding problems. Can we design rule-based, verifiable rewards for training Physical AI reasoning models with reinforcement learning? In this work, we explore two types of rewards based on answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The first type of MCQs are designed based on human annotations. With inspiration from video self-supervised learning, we automatically generate second type of MCQ based on the structure of video data itself, such as solving puzzles with shuffled spatiotemporal video patches or predicting the arrow of time on whether video is playing"

[ 1 8 2 4 6 1 . 3 0 5 2 : r aLong-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) are vital for real-world applications but suffer high computational costs due to attentions quadratic complexity. Block-sparse attention mitigates this by focusing computation on critical regions, yet existing methods struggle with balancing accuracy and efficiency due to costly block importance measurements. In this paper, we introduce XAttention, plug-and-play framework that dramatically accelerates long-context inference in Transformers models using sparse attention. XAttentions key innovation is the insight that the sum of antidiagonal values (i.e., from the lower-left to upper-right) in the attention matrix provides powerful proxy for block importance. This allows for precise identification and pruning of non-essential blocks, resulting in high sparsity and dramatically accelerated inference. Across comprehensive evaluations on demanding long-context benchmarksincluding RULER and LongBench for language, VideoMME for video understanding, and VBench for video generationXAttention achieves accuracy comparable to full attention while delivering substantial computational gains. We demonstrate up to 13.5 acceleration in attention computation. These results underscore XAttentions ability to unlock the practical potential of block sparse attention, paving the way for scalable and efficient deployment of LCTMs in real-world applications. 1. Introduction The transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Dubey et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2023) is expanding beyond natural language processing, steering in new era of multimodal capabilities. Long-Context Transformer Models *Equal contribution 1Tsinghua University 2Massachusetts Institute of Technology 3SJTU 4NVIDIA. Correspondence to: Guangxuan Xiao <xgx@mit.edu>, Song Han <songhan@mit.edu>. 1 (LCTMs) are emerging as essential tools in this evolution, particularly for tasks like video understanding (Lin et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024) and video generation (Kong et al., 2025) that demand processing and generating exceptionally long sequences of information. These models hold the key to unlocking brilliant systems capable of interacting with the world in human-like way, understanding and generating not just text, but also visual information over extended periods. Imagine AI agents engaging in seamless, multimodal, day-long interactions, or powerful world simulators generating hours of coherent videotasks that hinge on processing tremendous number of tokens. However, realizing this vision requires overcoming significant challenge: the computational burden of the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017). While crucial for capturing relationships within sequences, attentions cost scales quadratically with sequence length. This quadratic scaling creates substantial bottleneck during the pre-filling stage, hindering the practical deployment of LCTMs for complex, real-world applications. In the pursuit of more efficient Transformers, block-sparse attention (Zaheer et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2024) has emerged as promising avenue. The core idea is appealing: instead of computing attention between all token pairs, focus resources on the most crucial regions of the attention map, creating blocks of relevant information. This selective computation promises to drastically reduce computational burden while preserving the models ability to capture essential longrange dependencies. Yet, existing block-sparse methods have struggled to deliver on their full potential, often grappling with trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. This stems from the lack of lightweight yet effective mechanisms for identifying and prioritizing truly important attention blocks. The overhead involved in determining block importance can negate the gains achieved through sparsity, rendering these methods impractical for real-world deployment. This leads us to question: Can we design block-sparse attention mechanism that dramatically accelerates longcontext Transformers without compromising accuracy, truly unlocking their potential for real-world applications? XAttention: Block Sparse Attention with Antidiagonal Scoring Figure 1. Illustration of XAttention: XAttention optimizes attention through three-step process: (Left) Strided Antidiagonal Scoring: Each block (88 in this example) is scored by summing values along its strided antidiagonals (stride = 4), with red lines generally indicating higher summed values and blue lines lower values. (Middle) Block Selection: High-scoring blocks are selected based on these evaluations. (Right) Block Sparse Attention: Attention is computed only on the selected blocks (red blocks on the right), achieving substantial computational savings. This example uses sequence length of 24. We answer this question by introducing XAttention, novel plug-and-play framework designed to significantly improve the efficiency of block-sparse attention in long-context Transformers. XAttention is based on the key insight that the sum of antidiagonal values within the attention matrix can serve as powerful, yet computationally efficient, indicator of block importance. Unlike existing methods that primarily rely on computationally intensive and lossy solutions like token pooling to identify important blocks, XAttention leverages this simple score to offer potentially more streamlined and direct approach for rapidly and accurately identifying critical attention blocks. This antidiagonal scoring algorithm allows XAttention to aggressively find and prune non-essential computations, achieving substantial sparsity without sacrificing accuracy. We extensively evaluate XAttention on challenging longcontext benchmarks, including RULER and LongBench for natural language processing, VideoMME for video understanding, and VBench for video generation. Across these benchmarks, XAttention achieves accuracy comparable to full attention while delivering substantial computational gains, demonstrating up to 13.5 acceleration in attention computation during pre-filling. These results underscore XAttentions ability to unlock the practical potential of block-sparse attention, paving the way for scalable and efficient deployment of long-context Transformers in demanding applications, especially in the expanding field of mu"

Knowledge Editing (KE) enables the modification of outdated or incorrect information in large language models (LLMs). While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they struggle to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that depend on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we observe that current layer-localized KE approaches, such as MEMIT and WISE, which edit only single or a few model layers, struggle to effectively incorporate updated information into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we propose CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enables more effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. CaKE leverages strategically curated data, guided by our circuits-based analysis, that enforces the model to utilize the modified knowledge, stimulating the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly integrated knowledge. Experimental results show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of updated knowledge across related reasoning tasks, leading to an average of 20% improvement in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on MQuAKE dataset compared to existing KE methods.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive progress in mathematical reasoning. While data augmentation is promising to enhance mathematical problem-solving ability, current approaches are predominantly limited to instance-level modifications-such as rephrasing or generating syntactic variations-which fail to capture and leverage the intrinsic relational structures inherent in mathematical knowledge. Inspired by human learning processes, where mathematical proficiency develops through systematic exposure to interconnected concepts, we introduce MathFusion, a novel framework that enhances mathematical reasoning through cross-problem instruction synthesis. MathFusion implements this through three fusion strategies: (1) sequential fusion, which chains related problems to model solution dependencies; (2) parallel fusion, which combines analogous problems to reinforce conceptual understanding; and (3) conditional fusion, which creates context-aware selective problems to enhance reasoning flexibility. By applying these strategies, we generate a new dataset, MathFusionQA, followed by fine-tuning models (DeepSeekMath-7B, Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B) on it. Experimental results demonstrate that MathFusion achieves substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency, boosting performance by 18.0 points in accuracy across diverse benchmarks while requiring only 45K additional synthetic instructions, representing a substantial improvement over traditional single-instruction approaches. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/QizhiPei/mathfusion.

4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has recently gained considerable attention as a method for reconstructing dynamic scenes. Despite achieving superior quality, 4DGS typically requires substantial storage and suffers from slow rendering speed. In this work, we delve into these issues and identify two key sources of temporal redundancy. (Q1) Short-Lifespan Gaussians: 4DGS uses a large portion of Gaussians with short temporal span to represent scene dynamics, leading to an excessive number of Gaussians. (Q2) Inactive Gaussians: When rendering, only a small subset of Gaussians contributes to each frame. Despite this, all Gaussians are processed during rasterization, resulting in redundant computation overhead. To address these redundancies, we present 4DGS-1K, which runs at over 1000 FPS on modern GPUs. For Q1, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Variation Score, a new pruning criterion that effectively removes short-lifespan Gaussians while encouraging 4DGS to capture scene dynamics using Gaussians with longer temporal spans. For Q2, we store a mask for active Gaussians across consecutive frames, significantly reducing redundant computations in rendering. Compared to vanilla 4DGS, our method achieves a 41times reduction in storage and 9times faster rasterization speed on complex dynamic scenes, while maintaining comparable visual quality. Please see our project page at https://4DGS-1K.github.io.

"4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has recently gained considerable attention as a method for reconstructing dynamic scenes. Despite achieving superior quality, 4DGS typically requires substantial storage and suffers from slow rendering speed. In this work, we delve into these issues and identify two key sources of temporal redundancy. (Q1) Short-Lifespan Gaussians: 4DGS uses a large portion of Gaussians with short temporal span to represent scene dynamics, leading to an excessive number of Gaussians. (Q2) Inactive Gaussians: When rendering, only a small subset of Gaussians contributes to each frame. Despite this, all Gaussians are processed during rasterization, resulting in redundant computation overhead. To address these redundancies, we present 4DGS-1K, which runs at over 1000 FPS on modern GPUs. For Q1, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Variation Score, a new pruning criterion that effectively removes short-lifespan Gaussians while encouraging 4DGS to capture scene dynamics using Gaussians with longer temporal spans. For Q2, we store a mask for active Gaussians across consecutive frames, significantly reducing redundant computations in rendering. Compared to vanilla 4DGS, our method achieves a 41times reduction in storage and 9times faster rasterization speed on complex dynamic scenes, while maintaining comparable visual quality.

We present 3D Spatial MultiModal Memory (M3), a multimodal memory system designed to retain information about medium-sized static scenes through video sources for visual perception. By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques with foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering feature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of knowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works on feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional features for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss between distilled features and foundation model features. To address these challenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and Gaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To validate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature similarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to highlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention. Our approach encompasses a diverse range of foundation models, including vision-language models (VLMs), perception models, and large multimodal and language models (LMMs/LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate real-world applicability, we deploy M3's feature field in indoor scenes on a quadruped robot. Notably, we claim that M3 is the first work to address the core compression challenges in 3D feature distillation.

Reasoning large language models are rapidly evolving across various domains. However, their capabilities in handling complex financial tasks still require in-depth exploration. In this paper, we introduce Fin-R1, a reasoning large language model specifically designed for the financial sector. Fin-R1 is built using a two-stage architecture, leveraging a financial reasoning dataset distilled and processed based on DeepSeek-R1. Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) training, it demonstrates performance close to DeepSeek-R1 with a parameter size of 7 billion across a range of financial reasoning tasks. It achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in the FinQA and ConvFinQA tasks between those LLMs in our evaluation, surpassing larger models in other tasks as well. Fin-R1 showcases strong reasoning and decision-making capabilities, providing solutions to various problems encountered in the financial domain.

Physical AI systems need to perceive, understand, and perform complex actions in the physical world. In this paper, we present the Cosmos-Reason1 models that can understand the physical world and generate appropriate embodied decisions (e.g., next step action) in natural language through long chain-of-thought reasoning processes. We begin by defining key capabilities for Physical AI reasoning, with a focus on physical common sense and embodied reasoning. To represent physical common sense, we use a hierarchical ontology that captures fundamental knowledge about space, time, and physics. For embodied reasoning, we rely on a two-dimensional ontology that generalizes across different physical embodiments. Building on these capabilities, we develop two multimodal large language models, Cosmos-Reason1-8B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. We curate data and train our models in four stages: vision pre-training, general supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Physical AI SFT, and Physical AI reinforcement learning (RL) as the post-training. To evaluate our models, we build comprehensive benchmarks for physical common sense and embodied reasoning according to our ontologies. Evaluation results show that Physical AI SFT and reinforcement learning bring significant improvements. To facilitate the development of Physical AI, we will make our code and pre-trained models available under the NVIDIA Open Model License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1.

"Physical AI systems need to perceive, understand, and perform complex actions in the physical world. In this paper, we present the Cosmos-Reason1 models that can understand the physical world and generate appropriate embodied decisions (e.g., next step action) in natural language through long chain-of-thought reasoning processes. We begin by defining key capabilities for Physical AI reasoning, with a focus on physical common sense and embodied reasoning. To represent physical common sense, we use a hierarchical ontology that captures fundamental knowledge about space, time, and physics. For embodied reasoning, we rely on a two-dimensional ontology that generalizes across different physical embodiments. Building on these capabilities, we develop two multimodal large language models, Cosmos-Reason1-8B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. We curate data and train our models in four stages: vision pre-training, general supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Physical AI SFT, and Physical AI reinforcement learning (RL) as the post-training. To evaluate our models, we build comprehensive benchmarks for physical common sense and embodied reasoning according to our ontologies. Evaluation results show that Physical AI SFT and reinforcement learning bring significant improvements. To facilitate the development of Physical AI, we will make our code and pre-trained models available under the NVIDIA Open Model License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1."

Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) are vital for real-world applications but suffer high computational costs due to attention's quadratic complexity. Block-sparse attention mitigates this by focusing computation on critical regions, yet existing methods struggle with balancing accuracy and efficiency due to costly block importance measurements. In this paper, we introduce XAttention, a plug-and-play framework that dramatically accelerates long-context inference in Transformers models using sparse attention. XAttention's key innovation is the insight that the sum of antidiagonal values (i.e., from the lower-left to upper-right) in the attention matrix provides a powerful proxy for block importance. This allows for precise identification and pruning of non-essential blocks, resulting in high sparsity and dramatically accelerated inference. Across comprehensive evaluations on demanding long-context benchmarks-including RULER and LongBench for language, VideoMME for video understanding, and VBench for video generation. XAttention achieves accuracy comparable to full attention while delivering substantial computational gains. We demonstrate up to 13.5x acceleration in attention computation. These results underscore XAttention's ability to unlock the practical potential of block sparse attention, paving the way for scalable and efficient deployment of LCTMs in real-world applications.

Recent advances in video generation have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality and temporal coherence. Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics. Our project page are publicly available at https://quanhaol.github.io/magicmotion-site.
