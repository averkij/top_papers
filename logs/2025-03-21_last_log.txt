Visual Language Action (VLA) models, pretrained on large-scale web datasets, have shown promise in decision-making tasks. However, previous work has primarily focused on action post-training, often neglecting enhancements to the foundational model itself. In response, we introduce novel approach, Act from Visual Language Post-Training, which refines Visual Language Models (VLMs) through visual and linguistic guidance in self-supervised manner. This enhancement improves the models capabilities in world knowledge, visual recognition, and spatial grounding in open-world environments. Following the above post-training paradigms, we obtain the first VLA models in Minecraft that can follow human instructions on over 1k different atomic tasks, including crafting, smelting, cooking, mining, and killing. Our experiments demonstrate that post-training on non-trajectory tasks leads to significant 40% improvement over the best agent baseline on diverse set of atomic tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional imitation learning-based policies in Minecraft, achieving stateof-the-art performance. We have open-sourced the code, models, and datasets to foster further research. The project page can be found in https://craftjarvis.github.io/JarvisVLA. 1. Introduction Pretraining foundation models on large-scale, noisy internet datasets has become mainstream approach in NLP and vision [1, 18, 38, 43].

Additionally, for models leveraging guidance distillation, such as FLUX, we show that disabling classifier-free guidance, i.e., setting the guidance scale to 1 during adaptation, is crucial for satisfactory performance. Extensive experiments validate that URAE achieves comparable 2K-generation performance to state-of-the-art closed-source models like FLUX1.1 [Pro] Ultra with only 3K samples and 2K iterations, while setting new benchmarks for 4K-resolution generation. Codes are available here. 1. Introduction Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in text-toimage generation with diffusion models (Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Rombach et al., 2022; Ho et al., 2020). From UNet-based architectures (Ronneberger et al., 2015; Rombach et al., 2022) to latest state-of-theart Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) (Peebles & Xie, 2023; Bao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Esser et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024), these modUltra-Resolution Adaptation with Ease els leverage powerful backbones and multistep denoising schemes to generate high-quality and diverse images from textual prompts effectively, solidifying their leading position in this field (Croitoru et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023a). Nevertheless, extending current diffusion models to ultraresolution generation, such as 4K, remains significant challenge. The process typically demands massive amounts of high-quality data and substantial computational resources, making training at such resolutions daunting and accessible only to industry-scale efforts. Although recent attempts have been made to train 4K-resolution text-to-image models (Chen et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024), they rely on internal datasets containing millions of high-resolution images to fine-tune base low-resolution models. In practice, collecting such large-scale datasets for training is highly cumbersome if not infeasible at all. Meanwhile, tuning the entire diffusion backbone introduces an intensive GPU memory footprint, especially for state-of-the-art models like FLUX (Black Forest Labs, 2023) and Stable Diffusion 3.5 (Esser et al., 2024). Focusing on these drawbacks, we are curious about one practical question: Can this ultra-resolution adaptation process be made easier? In this paper, we answer the question positively by proposing URAE, set of key guidelines, under which ultra-resolution adaptation is achievable with merely thousands of training samples and iterations. Specifically, we initiate our exploration from two key aspects: data and parameter efficiency. On the one hand, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that synthetic data produced by some teacher models can largely enhance training convergence. However, despite recent advancements in text-to-image generation, state-of-the-art models still face significant challenges in acquiring high-quality synthetic training data for ultra-resolution adaptation, such as 4K. We thus, on the other hand, investigate such scenarios where synthetic data are unavailable and identify that tuning minor components of the pre-trained weight matrices is more effective than commonly used parameter-efficient adaptation strategies like LoRA (Hu et al., 2022). Furthermore, we delve into the principles of fine-tuning guidance-distilled models like FLUX and discover that disabling classifier-free guidanceby setting the guidance scale to 1is essential, regardless of the availability of synthetic data. Backed up by the above guidelines, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that URAE achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art closedsource models like FLUX1.1 [Pro] Ultra with merely 3K training samples and 2K adaptation iterations. Meanwhile, it surpasses previous models in 4K generation performance and remains highly compatible with existing training-free high-resolution generation pipelines (Du et al., 2024b; Meng et al., 2021), enabling further performance improvements. In summary, the contributions of this paper are: We are the first to delve into the problem of ultraresolution adaption to the best of our knowledge; We propose URAE, set of key guidelines focusing on data efficiency, parameter efficiency, and classifierfree guidance, to facilitate the adaptation of existing text-to-image models to higher resolutions; We validate that URAE achieves comparable performance in 2K generation, superior capabilities in 4K generation, and strong compatibility with existing training-free high-resolution generation pipelines. 2. Methodology In this section, we delve into the motivations and technical details of URAE, our proposed strategy for ultra-resolution adaptation. We begin with some preliminary concepts, followed by three key components including training with synthetic data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, and classifier-free guidance. 2.1. Preliminary State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models commonly adopt the flow matching training scheme (Esser et al., 2024; Lipman et al., 2022). Specifically, in each iteration, batch of images and their corresponding textual descriptions is sampled. These images are then encoded into latent map z0 using pre-trained VAE encoder, and noise map ϵ is drawn from Gaussian distribution. Let zt denote the noisy version of z0 after applying ϵ at th"

InfiniteYou generates identity-preserved images with exceptional identity similarity, text-image alignment, quality, and aesthetics.Achieving flexible and high-fidelity identity-preserved image generation remains formidable, particularly with advanced Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) like FLUX. We introduce InfiniteYou (InfU), one of the earliest robust frameworks leveraging DiTs for this task. InfU addresses significant issues of existing methods, such as insufficient identity similarity, poor text-image alignment, and low generation quality and aesthetics. Central to InfU is InfuseNet, component that injects identity features into the DiT base model via residual connections, enhancing identity similarity while maintaining generation capabilities. multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine1 tuning (SFT) with synthetic single-person-multiple-sample (SPMS) data, further improves text-image alignment, ameliorates image quality, and alleviates face copy-pasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfU achieves stateIn of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines. addition, the plug-and-play design of InfU ensures compatibility with various existing methods, offering valuable contribution to the broader community.

Introduction Identity-preserved image generation aims to recraft photograph of specific person using free-form text descriptions while preserving facial identity. This task is challenging but highly beneficial. Previous methods [14, 51, 54] have been mainly developed on U-Net [42]-based text-toimage diffusion models [17, 41, 46], such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) [38]. However, due to the limited generation capacity of the base model, the quality of generated images remains inadequate. Recent strides in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) [12, 37] have made remarkable progress in content creation. In particular, the latest releases of state-ofthe-art rectified flow DiTs, such as FLUX [26] and Stable Diffusion 3.5 [12], showcase incredible image generation quality. Consequently, it is crucial to explore solutions that can leverage the immense potential of DiTs for downstream applications like identity-preserved image generation. DiT-based identity-preserved image generation remains the absence of cusformidable due to several factors: tomized module designs, difficulties in model scaling, and lack of high-quality data. Thus, effective solutions for this task using state-of-the-art rectified flow [4, 33] DiTs, such as FLUX [26], are currently scarce in both academia and industry. PuLID-FLUX, derived from PuLID [14], presented an initial attempt to develop an identity-preserved image generation model based on FLUX. Other opensource efforts, including FLUX.1-dev IP-Adapters from InstantX [20] and XLabs-AI [3], are not tailored for human facial identities. Nevertheless, existing methods fall short in three key aspects: 1) The identity similarity is not sufficient; 2) The text-image alignment and editability are poor, and the face copy-paste issue is evident; 3) The generation capability of FLUX is largely compromised, resulting in lower image quality and aesthetic appeal. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose simple yet effective framework for identity-preserved image generation, namely InfiniteYou (InfU). This framework is designed to be systematic and robust, enabling flexible text-based photo re-creation for diverse identities, races, and age groups across various scenarios. We introduce InfuseNet, generalization of ControlNet [56], which ingests identity information along with the controlling conditions. The projected identity features are injected by InfuseNet into the DiT base model through residual connections, thereby disentangling text and identity injections. InfuseNet is both scalable and compatible, harnessing the powerful generation capabilities of DiTs. The scaleup injection network and the delicate architecture design, equipped with large-scale model training, effectively enhance identity similarity. To improve text-image alignment, image quality, and aesthetic appeal, we employ multistage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) [21, 49]. The SFT stage utilizes carefully designed synthetic single-person-multiple-sample (SPMS) data generation, leveraging our pretrained model itself and various off-the-shelf modules. This strategy enhances the quantity, quality, aesthetics, and text-image alignment of the training data, thus improving overall model performance and alleviating the face copy-paste issue. Thanks to the InfuseNet design, identity information is injected purely via residual connections between DiT blocks, unlike conventional practices [14, 51, 54] that directly modify attention [50] layers via IP-Adapter (IPA). Consequently, the generation capability of the base model remains largely intact, allowing for the generation of high-quality and aesthetically pleasing images. Moreover, InfU is plug-and-play and readily compatible with many other methods or plugins, thus offering significant value to the broader community.the proposed InfU framework achieves state-of-the-art performance (see Figure 1), significantly surpassing existing baselines in identity similarity, text-image alignment, and overall image quality. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We propose InfiniteYou (InfU), versatile and robust DiT-based framework for flexible identity-preserved image generation under various scenarios. We introduce InfuseNet, generalization of ControlNet, which effectively injects identity features into the DiT base model via residual connections, enhancing identity similarity with minimal impact on generation capabilities. We employ multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), using synthetic single-person-multiple-sample (SPMS) data generation. This approach significantly improves text-image alignment, image quality, and aesthetic appeal. The InfU module features desirable plug-and-play design, compatible with many existing methods, thus providing valuable contribution to the broader community. 2.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks. Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2 reasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences improve performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due to verbose and redundant outputs, known as the "overthinking phenomenon". In this paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically investigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient reasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we categorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based efficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models into more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning models; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to dynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input prompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency based on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control. Additionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning models, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and discuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.

3D shape generation has greatly flourished through the development of so-called "native" 3D diffusion, particularly through the Vecset Diffusion Model (VDM). While recent advancements have shown promising results in generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed generation. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a lightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of the vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply FlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic evaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D generation methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art while reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for generation.

"3D shape generation has greatly flourished through the development of so-called "native" 3D diffusion, particularly through the Vecset Diffusion Model (VDM). While recent advancements have shown promising results in generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed generation. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a lightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of the vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply FlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic evaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D generation methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art while reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for generation. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Tencent/FlashVDM."

Recently, action-based decision-making in open-world environments has gained significant attention. Visual Language Action (VLA) models, pretrained on large-scale web datasets, have shown promise in decision-making tasks. However, previous work has primarily focused on action post-training, often neglecting enhancements to the foundational model itself. In response, we introduce a novel approach, Act from Visual Language Post-Training, which refines Visual Language Models (VLMs) through visual and linguistic guidance in a self-supervised manner. This enhancement improves the models' capabilities in world knowledge, visual recognition, and spatial grounding in open-world environments. Following the above post-training paradigms, we obtain the first VLA models in Minecraft that can follow human instructions on over 1k different atomic tasks, including crafting, smelting, cooking, mining, and killing. Our experiments demonstrate that post-training on non-trajectory tasks leads to a significant 40% improvement over the best agent baseline on a diverse set of atomic tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional imitation learning-based policies in Minecraft, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We have open-sourced the code, models, and datasets to foster further research. The project page can be found in https://craftjarvis.github.io/JarvisVLA.

Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, training models for high-resolution image generation remains challenging, particularly when training data and computational resources are limited. In this paper, we explore this practical problem from two key perspectives: data and parameter efficiency, and propose a set of key guidelines for ultra-resolution adaptation termed URAE. For data efficiency, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that synthetic data generated by some teacher models can significantly promote training convergence. For parameter efficiency, we find that tuning minor components of the weight matrices outperforms widely-used low-rank adapters when synthetic data are unavailable, offering substantial performance gains while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, for models leveraging guidance distillation, such as FLUX, we show that disabling classifier-free guidance, i.e., setting the guidance scale to 1 during adaptation, is crucial for satisfactory performance. Extensive experiments validate that URAE achieves comparable 2K-generation performance to state-of-the-art closed-source models like FLUX1.1 [Pro] Ultra with only 3K samples and 2K iterations, while setting new benchmarks for 4K-resolution generation. Codes are available https://github.com/Huage001/URAE{here}.

Video identity customization seeks to produce high-fidelity videos that maintain consistent identity and exhibit significant dynamics based on users' reference images. However, existing approaches face two key challenges: identity degradation over extended video length and reduced dynamics during training, primarily due to their reliance on traditional self-reconstruction training with static images. To address these issues, we introduce MagicID, a novel framework designed to directly promote the generation of identity-consistent and dynamically rich videos tailored to user preferences. Specifically, we propose constructing pairwise preference video data with explicit identity and dynamic rewards for preference learning, instead of sticking to the traditional self-reconstruction. To address the constraints of customized preference data, we introduce a hybrid sampling strategy. This approach first prioritizes identity preservation by leveraging static videos derived from reference images, then enhances dynamic motion quality in the generated videos using a Frontier-based sampling method.

"Video identity customization seeks to produce high-fidelity videos that maintain consistent identity and exhibit significant dynamics based on users' reference images. However, existing approaches face two key challenges: identity degradation over extended video length and reduced dynamics during training, primarily due to their reliance on traditional self-reconstruction training with static images. To address these issues, we introduce MagicID, a novel framework designed to directly promote the generation of identity-consistent and dynamically rich videos tailored to user preferences. Specifically, we propose constructing pairwise preference video data with explicit identity and dynamic rewards for preference learning, instead of sticking to the traditional self-reconstruction. To address the constraints of customized preference data, we introduce a hybrid sampling strategy. This approach first prioritizes identity preservation by leveraging static videos derived from reference images, then enhances dynamic motion quality in the generated videos using a Frontier-based sampling method. By utilizing these hybrid preference pairs, we optimize the model to align with the reward differences between pairs of customized preferences. Extensive experiments show that MagicID successfully achieves consistent identity and natural dynamics, surpassing existing methods across various metrics."

Achieving flexible and high-fidelity identity-preserved image generation remains formidable, particularly with advanced Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) like FLUX. We introduce InfiniteYou (InfU), one of the earliest robust frameworks leveraging DiTs for this task. InfU addresses significant issues of existing methods, such as insufficient identity similarity, poor text-image alignment, and low generation quality and aesthetics. Central to InfU is InfuseNet, a component that injects identity features into the DiT base model via residual connections, enhancing identity similarity while maintaining generation capabilities. A multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic single-person-multiple-sample (SPMS) data, further improves text-image alignment, ameliorates image quality, and alleviates face copy-pasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfU achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines. In addition, the plug-and-play design of InfU ensures compatibility with various existing methods, offering a valuable contribution to the broader community.
