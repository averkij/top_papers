Multi-turn conversation confidence estimation lacks systematic evaluation frameworks, prompting the introduction of novel metrics and a "Hinter-Guesser" paradigm for controlled dataset generation to improve calibration and monotonicity.  					AI-generated summary 				 While confidence estimation is a promising direction for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), current research dominantly focuses on single-turn settings. The dynamics of model confidence in multi-turn conversations, where context accumulates and ambiguity is progressively resolved, remain largely unexplored. Reliable confidence estimation in multi-turn settings is critical for many downstream applications, such as autonomous agents and human-in-the-loop systems. This work presents the first systematic study of confidence estimation in multi-turn interactions, establishing a formal evaluation framework grounded in two key desiderata: per-turn calibration and monotonicity of confidence as more information becomes available. To facilitate this, we introduce novel metrics, including a length-normalized Expected Calibration Error (InfoECE), and a new "Hinter-Guesser" paradigm for generating controlled evaluation datasets. Our experiments reveal that widely-used confidence techniques struggle with calibration and monotonicity in multi-turn dialogues. We propose P(Sufficient), a logit-based probe that achieves comparatively better performance, although the task remains far from solved. Our work provides a foundational methodology for developing more reliable and trustworthy conversational agents.

  "desc": "В работе представлено первое систематическое исследование оценки уверенности (confidence estimation) языковых моделей в многооборотных диалогах, где контекст накапливается и неопределённость постепенно снижается. Авторы предложили формальную схему оценки, основанную на двух ключевых критериях: калибровке на каждом ходу и монотонности уверенности при поступлении новой информации. Для этого введены новые метрики, включая нормализованную по длине Expected Calibration Error (InfoECE), и парадигма \"Hinter-Guesser\" для генерации контролируемых оценочных наборов данных. Экспериментальные результаты показывают, что известные техники оценки уверенности плохо работают с калибровкой в многооборотных диалогах, а предложенный метод P(Sufficient) демонстрирует лучшую производительность.",
