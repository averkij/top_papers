We introduce materiomusic as a generative framework linking the hierarchical structures of matter with the compositional logic of music. Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention. We show that science and art are generative acts of world-building under constraint, with vibration as a shared grammar organizing structure across scales.

Они показывают, что звук может служить научным инструментом познания, где прослушивание становится способом видения, позволяя услышать паттерны от фемтосекундных молекулярных колебаний до миллиардолетней эволюционной истории. Используя анализ энтропии музыкальных шкал и параллели с оптимумом Холла-Петча в материаловедении, авторы доказывают, что оптимальная новизна в науке и искусстве возникает при промежуточном уровне дефектности и сложности. Применяя модели искусственного интеллекта на основе роевого поведения, исследователи генерируют музыку с человекоподобными структурными свойствами, демонстрируя единую грамматику вибрации, организующую структуры на всех масштабах природы.",
