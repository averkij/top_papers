Fig. 1: The radar chart compares the mIoU(%) of different semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods across six remote sensing datasets under the 1/8 labeled ratio. Co2S consistently maintains leading performance across all benchmarks. coverage [4], complex scene layouts [5], and fine-grained category structures [6]. Consequently, pixel-wise semantic segmentation has emerged as core task, requiring models to be simultaneously sensitive to high-level semantics (e.g., category identity and contextual relationships) and low-level details (e.g., object boundaries and small structures [7]). Nevertheless, the fully supervised deep models that currently dominate this field heavily depend on exhaustive pixel-level annotations, which are notoriously expensive and time-consuming to obtain due to the need for expert interpretation [8]. In practice, only small fraction of available images can be labeled, while the vast majority remain unlabeled [9]. Under such conditions, there is pressing need for semi-supervised segmentation methods that can effectively exploit abundant unlabeled data, cope with label scarcity, and maintain stable optimization despite the presence of noisy pseudo-labels [10, 11]. To mitigate the reliance on massive annotations, recent research has made substantial strides in semi-supervised learning, evolving through three primary paradigms in the remote sensing domain: generative adversarial networks (GANs) [12 14], consistency-based methods [1519], and pseudo-labeling methods [2023]. Early GAN-based approaches, exemplified by Hung et al. [12] and Souly et al. [13], align feature distributions via adversarial learning but often suffer from training instability and convergence difficulties. Subsequently, consistency-based methods like FixMatch [18] and UniMatch [19] became mainstream by enforcing prediction invariance under perturbations; however, they remain susceptible to confirmation bias, where incorrect predictions are reinforced over time. Similarly, pseudo-labeling strategies like U2PL [21] and DWL [24] expand the training set with high-confidence predictions, yet they struggle with noise accumulation when the initial predictions are unreliable. Crucially, since these paradigms primarily rely on self-generated supervisory signals to guide training, they remain vulnerable to pseudo-label drift, particularly in complex remote sensing scenes. Without strong external guidance to rectify errors, these methods frequently encounter difficulties in distinguishing semantically similar categories or delineating precise object boundaries under severe label scarcity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Co2S, stable semisupervised remote sensing segmentation framework. We construct heterogeneous dual-student architecture that synergizes complementary priors derived from vision-language models and self-supervised models to mitigate pseudo-label drift. The framework is underpinned by an explicit-implicit semantic collaborative guidance mechanism and global-lo"

Text:"IMA++: ISIC Archive Multi-Annotator Dermoscopic Skin Lesion Segmentation Dataset Kumar Abhishek, Jeremy Kawahara, and Ghassan Hamarneh Medical Image Analysis Lab, School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Canada AIP Labs, Hungary 1 5 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 2 7 4 1 2 . 2 1 5 2 : r AbstractMulti-annotator medical image segmentation is an important research problem, but requires annotated datasets that are expensive to collect. Dermoscopic skin lesion imaging allows human experts and AI systems to observe morphological structures otherwise not discernable from regular clinical photographs. However, currently there are no large-scale publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation (SLS) datasets with annotator-labels for dermoscopic skin lesion imaging. We introduce ISIC MultiAnnot++, large public multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset for images from the ISIC Archive. The final dataset contains 17,684 segmentation masks spanning 14,967 dermoscopic images, where 2,394 dermoscopic images have 2-5 segmentations per image, making it the largest publicly available SLS dataset. Further, metadata about the segmentation, including the annotators skill level and segmentation tool, is included, enabling research on topics such as annotator-specific preference modeling for segmentation and annotator metadata analysis. We provide an analysis on the characteristics of this dataset, curated data partitions, and consensus segmentation masks.

A semi-supervised remote sensing image segmentation framework combines vision-language and self-supervised models to reduce pseudo-label drift through dual-student architecture and semantic co-guidance mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Semi-supervised remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation offers a promising solution to alleviate the burden of exhaustive annotation, yet it fundamentally struggles with pseudo-label drift, a phenomenon where confirmation bias leads to the accumulation of errors during training. In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently achieves leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios.

**Justification:**

- **TRANSFER_LEARNING**: The paper explicitly discusses transferring knowledge from pretrained vision-language models (CLIP) and self-supervised models (DINOv3) to a downstream segmentation task. This is a core transfer learning approach where priors from foundation models are leveraged for a new domain (remote sensing image segmentation).

- **SYNTHETIC**: The paper addresses pseudo-label generation in semi-supervised learning, which involves creating artificial labels for unlabeled data. The framework is designed to handle pseudo-label drift, indicating the use of synthetically generated labels as training data.

A large-scale public multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset is introduced with extensive metadata for annotator analysis and consensus modeling.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-annotator medical image segmentation is an important research problem, but requires annotated datasets that are expensive to collect. Dermoscopic skin lesion imaging allows human experts and AI systems to observe morphological structures otherwise not discernable from regular clinical photographs. However, currently there are no large-scale publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation (SLS) datasets with annotator-labels for dermoscopic skin lesion imaging. We introduce ISIC MultiAnnot++, a large public multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset for images from the ISIC Archive. The final dataset contains 17,684 segmentation masks spanning 14,967 dermoscopic images, where 2,394 dermoscopic images have 2-5 segmentations per image, making it the largest publicly available SLS dataset. Further, metadata about the segmentation, including the annotators' skill level and segmentation tool, is included, enabling research on topics such as annotator-specific preference modeling for segmentation and annotator metadata analysis. We provide an analysis on the characteristics of this dataset, curated data partitions, and consensus segmentation masks.
