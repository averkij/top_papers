Text:"DiffProxy: Multi-View Human Mesh Recovery via Diffusion-Generated Dense Proxies Renke Wang1, Zhenyu Zhang2*, Ying Tai2, Jian Yang1* 1PCA Lab, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China 2Nanjing University, School of Intelligent Science and Technology 6 2 0 2 5 ] . [ 1 7 6 2 2 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r Figure 1. DiffProxy is trained exclusively on synthetic data and achieves robust generalization to real-world scenarios. Our framework accepts diverse prompts (visual and textual), handles difficult poses, generalizes to challenging environments, and supports partial views with flexible view counts. Three key advantages: (i) Annotation bias-freetraining on synthetic data avoids fitting biases from real datasets; (ii) Flexibleadapts to varying view counts, handles partial observations, and works across diverse capture conditions; (iii) Cross-data generalizationachieves strong performance across unseen real-world datasets without requiring real training pairs.

DiffProxy enables human mesh recovery from multi-view images by generating multi-view consistent proxies using diffusion-based generative priors, achieving state-of-the-art performance through synthetic training and robust test-time scaling.  					AI-generated summary 				 Human mesh recovery from multi-view images faces a fundamental challenge: real-world datasets contain imperfect ground-truth annotations that bias the models' training, while synthetic data with precise supervision suffers from domain gap. In this paper, we propose DiffProxy, a novel framework that generates multi-view consistent human proxies for mesh recovery. Central to DiffProxy is leveraging the diffusion-based generative priors to bridge the synthetic training and real-world generalization. Its key innovations include: (1) a multi-conditional mechanism for generating multi-view consistent, pixel-aligned human proxies; (2) a hand refinement module that incorporates flexible visual prompts to enhance local details; and (3) an uncertainty-aware test-time scaling method that increases robustness to challenging cases during optimization. These designs ensure that the mesh recovery process effectively benefits from the precise synthetic ground truth and generative advantages of the diffusion-based pipeline. Trained entirely on synthetic data, DiffProxy achieves state-of-the-art performance across five real-world benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization particularly on challenging scenarios with occlusions and partial views.
