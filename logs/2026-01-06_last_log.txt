Text:"2026-01-06 Falcon-H1R: Pushing the Reasoning Frontiers with Hybrid Model for Efficient Test-Time Scaling Falcon LLM Team1 Iheb Chaabane Puneesh Khanna Slim Frikha Shi Hu Abdalgader Abubaker Reda Alami Mikhail Lubinets Mohamed El Amine Seddik Hakim Hacid Suhail Mohmad https://huggingface.co/tiiuae [Falcon-H1R collection] Abstract This work introduces Falcon-H1R, 7B-parameter reasoning-optimized model that establishes the feasibility of achieving competitive reasoning performance with small language models (SLMs). Falcon-H1R stands out for its parameter efficiency, consistently matching or outperforming SOTA reasoning models that are 2 to 7 larger across variety of reasoning-intensive benchmarks. These results underscore the importance of careful data curation and targeted training strategies (via both efficient SFT and RL scaling) in delivering significant performance gains without increasing model size. Furthermore, Falcon-H1R advances the 3D limits of reasoning efficiency by combining faster inference (through its hybrid-parallel architecture design), token efficiency, and higher accuracy. This unique blend makes Falcon-H1R-7B practical backbone for scaling advanced reasoning systems, particularly in scenarios requiring extensive chain-of-thoughts generation and parallel test-time scaling. Leveraging the recently introduced DeepConf approach, Falcon-H1R achieves state-of-the-art test-time scaling efficiency, offering substantial improvements in both accuracy and computational cost. As result, Falcon-H1R demonstrates that compact models, through targeted model training and architectural choices, can deliver robust and scalable reasoning performance. Figure 1: DeepConf@512 (Fu et al., 2025a) average results over AIME24, AIME25, AMOBench, and GPQA-Diamond (Detailed results in Table 7). Falcon-H1R-7B achieves exceptional performance by pushing the reasoning frontiers in 3 dimensions: higher accuracy, token efficiency and fast inference in the parallel thinking setting."

Text:"6 2 0 2 5 ] . [ 1 4 1 3 2 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r Project Ariadne: Structural Causal Framework for Auditing Faithfulness in LLM AgentsJanuaryAs Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly tasked with high-stakes autonomous decisionmaking, the transparency of their reasoning processes has become critical safety concern. While Chain-ofThought (CoT) prompting allows agents to generate human-readable reasoning traces, it remains unclear whether these traces are faithful generative drivers of the models output or merely post-hoc rationalizations. We introduce Project Ariadne, novel XAI framework that utilizes Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and counterfactual logic to audit the causal integrity of agentic reasoning. Unlike existing interpretability methods that rely on surface-level textual similarity, Project Ariadne performs hard interventions (do-calculus) on intermediate reasoning nodessystematically inverting logic, negating premises, and reversing factual claimsto measure the Causal Sensitivity (ϕ) of the terminal answer. Our empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals persistent Faithfulness Gap. We define and detect widespread failure mode termed Causal Decoupling, where agents exhibit violation density (ρ) of up to 0.77 in factual and scientific domains. In these instances, agents arrive at identical conclusions despite contradictory internal logic, proving that their reasoning traces function as Reasoning Theater while decision-making is governed by latent parametric priors. Our findings suggest that current agentic architectures are inherently prone to unfaithful explanation, and we propose the Ariadne Score as new benchmark for aligning stated logic with model action. The rapid proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has ushered in paradigm shift in autonomous problem-solving, moving beyond simple text generation toward complex, multi-step Chainof-Thought (CoT) reasoning. As these agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domainsranging from financial forecasting to autonomous scientific discoverythe transparency of their decision-making processes becomes critical safety frontier. However, significant sociotechnical challenge remains: the Faithfulness Gap. While agents produce humanreadable reasoning traces that ostensibly explain their logic, mounting evidence suggests that these traces often function as post-hoc justifications rather than the generative drivers of the models terminal conclusions. This phenomenon, which we term Causal Decoupling, represents fundamental failure in Explainable AI (XAI). When an agents internal thoughts are not causally linked to its final actions, the reasoning trace becomes hallucinated explanationa dangerous veneer of transparency that masks the underlying black-box heuristics of the transformer architecture. To address this, we introduce Project Ariadne, diagnostic framework designed to audit the causal integrity of agentic reasoning through the lens of Structural Causal Models (SCMs). Unlike traditional evaluation metrics that rely on surface-level textual similarity or static benchmarks, Project Ariadne utilizes counterfactual interventionist approach. By treating the reasoning trace as sequence of discrete causal nodes, we systematically 1 perform hard interventionsflipping logical operators, negating factual premises, or inverting causal directions. We then observe the resulting shift in the agents counterfactual answer distribution. By quantifying the Causal Sensitivity of the output to these perturbations, Ariadne provides formal mathematical basis for distinguishing between truly thinking agents and those merely performing reasoning theater. In the following sections, we define the structural equations governing our interventionist framework, establish metrics for faithfulness violations, and demonstrate the utility of Project Ariadne in detecting unfaithful reasoning across state-of-theart agentic architectures.The evaluation of faithfulness in Large Language Model (LLM) agents has emerged as primary bottleneck in AI safety. Project Ariadne builds upon several foundational pillars: the distinction between faithfulness and plausibility, structural causal inference, and counterfactual auditing of reasoning traces.A central challenge in eXplainable AI (XAI) is ensuring that an agents reasoning trace (q) reflects its actual decision-making process (faithfulness) rather than merely serving as human-convincing narrative (plausibility) [2]. Foundational work has demonstrated that reasoning traces frequently function as post-hoc justifications [3]. Recent empirical studies confirm that LLMs often arrive at conclusions through biased heuristics despite providing seemingly logical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations [4], leading to what we define as Causal Decoupling. causal dependencies si = fstep(q, s<i, θ) [?]. By modeling the agents response function fagent : as causal graph, we can rigorously define faithfulness as causal consistency: change in reasoning ι(sk) = sk must necessitate change in the final answer a(q) = aι(q, k)."

"Falcon-H1R is a 7B-parameter language model that achieves competitive reasoning performance through efficient training strategies and architectural design, enabling scalable reasoning capabilities in compact models.  					AI-generated summary 				 This work introduces Falcon-H1R, a 7B-parameter reasoning-optimized model that establishes the feasibility of achieving competitive reasoning performance with small language models (SLMs). Falcon-H1R stands out for its parameter efficiency, consistently matching or outperforming SOTA reasoning models that are 2times to 7times larger across a variety of reasoning-intensive benchmarks. These results underscore the importance of careful data curation and targeted training strategies (via both efficient SFT and RL scaling) in delivering significant performance gains without increasing model size. Furthermore, Falcon-H1R advances the 3D limits of reasoning efficiency by combining faster inference (through its hybrid-parallel architecture design), token efficiency, and higher accuracy. This unique blend makes Falcon-H1R-7B a practical backbone for scaling advanced reasoning systems, particularly in scenarios requiring extensive chain-of-thoughts generation and parallel test-time scaling.

Project Ariadne uses structural causal models and counterfactual logic to evaluate the causal integrity of LLM reasoning, revealing a faithfulness gap where reasoning traces are not reliable drivers of outputs.  					AI-generated summary 				 As Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly tasked with high-stakes autonomous decision-making, the transparency of their reasoning processes has become a critical safety concern. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting allows agents to generate human-readable reasoning traces, it remains unclear whether these traces are faithful generative drivers of the model's output or merely post-hoc rationalizations. We introduce Project Ariadne, a novel XAI framework that utilizes Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and counterfactual logic to audit the causal integrity of agentic reasoning. Unlike existing interpretability methods that rely on surface-level textual similarity, Project Ariadne performs hard interventions (do-calculus) on intermediate reasoning nodes -- systematically inverting logic, negating premises, and reversing factual claims -- to measure the Causal Sensitivity (φ) of the terminal answer. Our empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a persistent Faithfulness Gap. We define and detect a widespread failure mode termed Causal Decoupling, where agents exhibit a violation density (ρ) of up to 0.77 in factual and scientific domains. In these instances, agents arrive at identical conclusions despite contradictory internal logic, proving that their reasoning traces function as "Reasoning Theater" while decision-making is governed by latent parametric priors. Our findings suggest that current agentic architectures are inherently prone to unfaithful explanation, and we propose the Ariadne Score as a new benchmark for aligning stated logic with model action.
