The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop comprehensive pipeline for constructing high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 20242025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.

However, management responses often exhibit varying degrees of evasivenessproviding tangential information, hedging, or outright refusing to address analyst inquiries (Nuaimi et al., 2025). Research has established strong correlations between evasive responses and negative future performance: companies with high evasiveness show 63% likelihood of underperformance within 180 days (Paragon Intel, 2024), and 40 percentage-point rise in response incoherence corresponds to 0.74% drop in 1-day stock returns. This motivates automated evasion detection systems for financial transparency analysis. Despite its practical importance, evasion detection faces critical bottleneck: high-quality supervision is scarce precisely where it matters most at the boundary between partially responsive and truly evasive answers. In practice, expert annotation is costly and inconsistent on ambiguous cases, while naïve large-scale pseudo-labeling tends to over-represent easy examples and to amplify the idiosyncrasies of single teacher. Consequently, single-model distillation (e.g., training on GPT-4 labels) can yield overconfident but biased labels, especially for subtle boundary cases, and scaling the same teacher does not address this failure mode. Multi-annotator crowdsourcing is natural remedy, but it is expensive and requires domain expertise to maintain consistency. Recent work has explored Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022) and LLM-as-Judge (Zheng et al., 2023) for evaluation. Separately, AI feedback has been used to scale alignment supervision (e.g., RLAIF (Lee et al., 2023) and UltraFeedback (Cui et al., 2024)). However, "

Despite recent advances in video synthesis, existing methods often grapple with the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction requirements. In this paper, we propose FlowAct-R1, framework specifically designed for real-time interactive humanoid video generation. Built upon MMDiT architecture, FlowActR1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves stable 25fps at 480p resolution with time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds. The proposed method provides holistic and fine-grained full-body control, enabling the agent to transition naturally between diverse behavioral states in interactive scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowAct-R1 achieves exceptional behavioral vividness and perceptual realism, while maintaining robust generalization across diverse character styles.

[ 1 3 0 1 0 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r Figure 1 We present FlowAct-R1, novel framework that enables lifelike, responsive, and high-fidelity humanoid video generation for seamless real-time interaction. 1 Method Neural Voice Puppetry [32] INFP [45] Omnihuman-1.5 [18] KlingAvatar 2.0 [31] LiveAvatar [16] FlowAct-R1 (ours) Stream Real-Time Full-body Control Generalization Vividness Table 1 Comparison of state-of-the-art humanoid video generation methods. FlowAct-R1 simultaneously achieves streaming, real-time generation with fully controllable, generalization, and lifelike video generation capacity.Enabling visual humanoid agents to engage in real-time, natural interactions with humans is long-standing objective in the research community [3, 4, 6, 14, 16, 23, 33, 45]. In the task of interactive humanoid video generation, the model is required to synthesize naturalistic videos conditioned on conversational contexts (e.g., audio and text) from both the user and the agent. To realize this vision, several critical challenges must be addressed. First, the model must support streaming and real-time video generation to ensure low-latency and responsive interaction [5, 15, 19, 22, 29, 38, 42]. Furthermore, as multi-round interaction inherently involves extended durations, maintaining visual quality and temporal consistency in long-form video remains non-trivial task [17, 21, 24, 34, 35, 39, 41]. Finally, humanoid interaction involves variety of behavioral states such as speaking, listening, reflecting, and idling. The ability to seamlessly transition between these dynamic states while producing plausible behaviors is essential for achieving perceptual realism and lifelike engagement [3, 4, 14, 23, 45]. To this end, we introduce FlowAct-R1, framework specifically designed for interactive humanoid generation. Built upon MMDiT architecture [12, 28], our approach enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary lengths. It achieves real-time performance while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. The framework facilitates fine-grained controllability over the generated humanoid videoencompassing lip-sync, facial expressions, body gestures, and object interactionsallowing it to adapt naturally to various behavioral states during interactions. Our method produces lifelike videos and demonstrates robust generalization across diverse characters. We believe this framework paves the way for applications such as live streaming, virtual companionship, and video conferencing. Early research on humanoid video generation has primarily centered on lip-synchronization [13, 25, 32, 40, 43, 44]. By conditioning on audio signals, these methods synthesize mouth movements precisely aligned with speech. While these techniques have reached commercial maturity [1, 2], their scope remains largely confined to the facial region, lacking fine-grained control over full-body gestures. This inherent limitation hinders the generation of highly expressive and naturalistic behaviors necessary for truly lifelike interaction. Recently, diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated significant breakthroughs in visual quality [7, 10, 18, 20, 31]. Although these approaches can precisely manipulate body dynamics to synthesize vivid motion, they often suffer from heavy computational overhead, leading to prohibitively slow inference speeds. Furthermore, most existing diffusion frameworks are restricted to short-clip generation and lack support for continuous streaming, which limits their deployment in real-time interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, several efforts have specifically targeted interactive tasks. While methods such as INFP [45] and ARIG [14] enable real-time streaming for long-form video, they are predominantly constrained to portrait-style cropping. Other approaches, such as TalkingMachines [23] and LiveAvatar [16], achieve real-time streaming performance through model distillation or engineering optimizations but still exhibit perceptual gap in terms of behavioral vividness and naturalness. In light of the limitations identified above, we introduce FlowAct-R1, framework designed expressly for interactive humanoid video generation. comprehensive comparison between our method and existing stateof-the-art approaches is presented in Table 1, highlighting FlowAct-R1s unique capability to simultaneously achieve streaming, real-time performance, and high-fidelity behavioral expressivity. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: 2 Streaming and Infinite-Length Generation: Leveraging chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, we adapt MMDiT backbone [12, 28] for streaming synthesis.

While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across imageconditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.

Achieving this requires large-scale, open-vocabulary video action datasets that span broad domains. We introduce Action100M, large-scale dataset constructed from 1.2M Internet instructional videos (14.6 years of duration), yielding O(100 million) temporally localized segments with open-vocabulary action supervision and rich captions. Action100M is generated by fully automated pipeline that (i) performs hierarchical temporal segmentation using V-JEPA 2 embeddings, (ii) produces multi-level frame and segment captions organized as Tree-ofCaptions, and (iii) aggregates evidence with reasoning model (GPT-OSS-120B) under multi-round Self-Refine procedure to output structured annotations (brief/detailed action, actor, brief/detailed caption). Training VL-JEPA on Action100M demonstrates consistent data-scaling improvements and strong zero-shot performance across diverse action recognition benchmarks, establishing Action100M as new foundation for scalable research in video understanding and world modeling.

[ 1 1 8 8 9 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r Figure 1 Generated examples from TMD. Four frames of 5s 480p videos generated from two text prompts using our TMD method (distilled from Wan2.1 14B T2V) with two different (effective) number of function evaluations (NFE) (see the definition of effective NFE in Eq. (16)). Abstract. Large video diffusion and flow models have achieved remarkable success in high-quality video generation, but their use in real-time interactive applications remains limited due to their inefficient multi-step sampling process. In this work, we present Transition Matching Distillation (TMD), novel framework for distilling video diffusion models into efficient few-step generators. The central idea of TMD is to match the multi-step denoising trajectory of diffusion model with few-step probability transition process, where each transition is modeled as lightweight conditional flow. To enable efficient distillation, we decompose the original diffusion backbone into two components: (1) main backbone, comprising the majority of early layers, that extracts semantic representations at each outer transition step; and (2) flow head, consisting of the last few layers, that leverages these representations to perform multiple inner flow updates. Given pretrained video diffusion model, we first introduce flow head to the model, and adapt it into conditional flow map. We then apply distribution matching distillation to the student model with flow head rollout in each transition step. Extensive experiments on distilling Wan2.1 1.3B and 14B text-to-video models demonstrate that TMD provides flexible and strong trade-off between generation speed and visual quality. In particular, TMD outperforms existing distilled models under comparable inference costs in terms of visual fidelity and prompt adherence. Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/"

A large-scale Chinese image-text dataset called DanQing is introduced to advance vision-language pretraining, demonstrating superior performance in various downstream tasks through continual pretraining of the SigLIP2 model.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate strong performance across various downstream tasks by learning from large-scale image-text pairs through contrastive pretraining. The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations.

Frontier language and vision models show varied safety performance across different evaluation criteria, highlighting the need for comprehensive, standardized safety assessments.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5.

Chain-of-Frame reasoning is integrated into text-to-image generation through progressive visual refinement with explicit intermediate steps, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent video generation models have revealed the emergence of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning, enabling frame-by-frame visual inference. With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench. These results indicate the substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation.

This directly addresses enhancing logical reasoning capabilities through progressive visual refinement.

- **SYNTHETIC**: The paper mentions curating "CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories" to model the generation process. This involves creating synthetic training data (trajectories showing the generation process from semantics to aesthetics) for training purposes.

Molmo2 is a new open-source video-language model family that achieves state-of-the-art performance through novel datasets and training methods, particularly excelling in video grounding tasks without relying on proprietary models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).

"Molmo2 is a new open-source video-language model family that achieves state-of-the-art performance through novel datasets and training methods, particularly excelling in video grounding tasks without relying on proprietary models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking)."

EvasionBench introduces a large-scale benchmark for detecting evasive responses in earnings calls using a multi-model annotation framework that leverages disagreement between advanced language models to identify challenging examples, resulting in a highly accurate model with significantly reduced inference costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Detecting evasive answers in earnings calls is critical for financial transparency, yet progress is hindered by the lack of large-scale benchmarks. We introduce EvasionBench, comprising 30,000 training samples and 1,000 human-annotated test samples (Cohen's Kappa 0.835) across three evasion levels. Our key contribution is a multi-model annotation framework leveraging a core insight: disagreement between frontier LLMs signals hard examples most valuable for training. We mine boundary cases where two strong annotators conflict, using a judge to resolve labels. This approach outperforms single-model distillation by 2.4 percent, with judge-resolved samples improving generalization despite higher training loss (0.421 vs 0.393) - evidence that disagreement mining acts as implicit regularization. Our trained model Eva-4B (4B parameters) achieves 81.3 percent accuracy, outperforming its base by 25 percentage points and approaching frontier LLM performance at a fraction of inference cost.

FlowAct-R1 enables real-time interactive humanoid video generation with high-fidelity synthesis and low-latency responsiveness through MMDiT architecture and chunkwise diffusion forcing strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Interactive humanoid video generation aims to synthesize lifelike visual agents that can engage with humans through continuous and responsive video. Despite recent advances in video synthesis, existing methods often grapple with the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction requirements. In this paper, we propose FlowAct-R1, a framework specifically designed for real-time interactive humanoid video generation. Built upon a MMDiT architecture, FlowAct-R1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce a chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by a novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves a stable 25fps at 480p resolution with a time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds. The proposed method provides holistic and fine-grained full-body control, enabling the agent to transition naturally between diverse behavioral states in interactive scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowAct-R1 achieves exceptional behavioral vividness and perceptual realism, while maintaining robust generalization across diverse character styles.

Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL) enhances multi-agent reasoning through structured textual experience injection and consensus-based decision making at inference time.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL), a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.

"Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL) enhances multi-agent reasoning through structured textual experience injection and consensus-based decision making at inference time.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL), a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning."

Reinforcement learning for large language models is enhanced by a rollout-level objective that rewards rare high-level reasoning strategies, improving diverse solution discovery without sacrificing initial performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks, yet it often suffers from exploration collapse: policies prematurely concentrate on a small set of dominant reasoning patterns, improving pass@1 while limiting rollout-level diversity and gains in pass@k. We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones. Across mathematics, physics, and medical reasoning benchmarks, our approach consistently improves pass@k across large sampling budgets and increases the area under the pass@k curve (AUC@K) without sacrificing pass@1, while sustaining exploration and uncovering more diverse solution strategies at scale.

Latent world models enhance video generation physics plausibility through inference-time alignment and trajectory steering, achieving superior performance in challenging benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 State-of-the-art video generative models produce promising visual content yet often violate basic physics principles, limiting their utility. While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.

Text-to-image diffusion models enhanced with language model reasoning capabilities achieve improved factual consistency and semantic alignment through a think-then-generate paradigm with dual-gradient reinforcement optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models (DMs) has enabled high-quality visual synthesis from diverse textual prompts. Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4. Our results constitute a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities.

MatchTIR enhances LLM reasoning by introducing fine-grained credit assignment through bipartite matching and dual-level advantage estimation for tool-integrated tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) empowers large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks by interleaving reasoning steps with external tool interactions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods typically rely on outcome- or trajectory-level rewards, assigning uniform advantages to all steps within a trajectory. This coarse-grained credit assignment fails to distinguish effective tool calls from redundant or erroneous ones, particularly in long-horizon multi-turn scenarios. To address this, we propose MatchTIR, a framework that introduces fine-grained supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment and dual-level advantage estimation. Specifically, we formulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth traces, utilizing two assignment strategies to derive dense turn-level rewards. Furthermore, to balance local step precision with global task success, we introduce a dual-level advantage estimation scheme that integrates turn-level and trajectory-level signals, assigning distinct advantage values to individual interaction turns. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model surpasses the majority of 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/quchangle1/MatchTIR.

"Action100M is a large-scale video action dataset constructed from internet instructional videos using automated pipelines with V-JEPA embeddings and GPT-based reasoning for structured annotations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Inferring physical actions from visual observations is a fundamental capability for advancing machine intelligence in the physical world. Achieving this requires large-scale, open-vocabulary video action datasets that span broad domains. We introduce Action100M, a large-scale dataset constructed from 1.2M Internet instructional videos (14.6 years of duration), yielding O(100 million) temporally localized segments with open-vocabulary action supervision and rich captions. Action100M is generated by a fully automated pipeline that (i) performs hierarchical temporal segmentation using V-JEPA 2 embeddings, (ii) produces multi-level frame and segment captions organized as a Tree-of-Captions, and (iii) aggregates evidence with a reasoning model (GPT-OSS-120B) under a multi-round Self-Refine procedure to output structured annotations (brief/detailed action, actor, brief/detailed caption). Training VL-JEPA on Action100M demonstrates consistent data-scaling improvements and strong zero-shot performance across diverse action recognition benchmarks, establishing Action100M as a new foundation for scalable research in video understanding and world modeling."

Transition Matching Distillation enables efficient video generation by distilling diffusion models into few-step predictors using conditional flows and semantic representation decomposition.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large video diffusion and flow models have achieved remarkable success in high-quality video generation, but their use in real-time interactive applications remains limited due to their inefficient multi-step sampling process. In this work, we present Transition Matching Distillation (TMD), a novel framework for distilling video diffusion models into efficient few-step generators. The central idea of TMD is to match the multi-step denoising trajectory of a diffusion model with a few-step probability transition process, where each transition is modeled as a lightweight conditional flow. To enable efficient distillation, we decompose the original diffusion backbone into two components: (1) a main backbone, comprising the majority of early layers, that extracts semantic representations at each outer transition step; and (2) a flow head, consisting of the last few layers, that leverages these representations to perform multiple inner flow updates. Given a pretrained video diffusion model, we first introduce a flow head to the model, and adapt it into a conditional flow map. We then apply distribution matching distillation to the student model with flow head rollout in each transition step. Extensive experiments on distilling Wan2.1 1.3B and 14B text-to-video models demonstrate that TMD provides a flexible and strong trade-off between generation speed and visual quality. In particular, TMD outperforms existing distilled models under comparable inference costs in terms of visual fidelity and prompt adherence. Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/genair/tmd

Ключевая идея заключается в сопоставлении многошагового процесса шумоподавления диффузионной модели с несколькими шагами вероятностного переходного процесса, где каждый переход моделируется лёгким условным потоком. Авторы декомпозируют основную сеть на две части: основной бакбон для извлечения семантических представлений и голову потока для выполнения обновлений внутри переходов. Экспериментальные результаты показывают, что TMD достигает оптимального компромисса между скоростью генерации видео и качеством визуализации, превосходя существующие методы дистилляции при сравнимых вычислительных затратах.",
