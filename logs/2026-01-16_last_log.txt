WildRayZer is a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis in dynamic environments that uses analysis-by-synthesis to handle moving cameras and objects through motion masking and gradient gating.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.

Метод использует анализ-синтез подход: сначала статический рендерер объясняет жесткую структуру сцены, а остаток выявляет области с движущимися объектами. На основе этих остатков создаются маски движения для маскирования токенов входа и управления градиентами потерь, чтобы сосредоточить обучение на заполнении фона. Авторы создали новый датасет D-RE10K с 15K видеопоследовательностями и демонстрируют, что WildRayZer превосходит baseline методы как в удалении артефактов от движущихся объектов, так и в качестве синтеза полного кадра.",
