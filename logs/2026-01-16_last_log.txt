Urban socio-semantic segmentation is achieved through a vision-language model framework that combines cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning with reinforcement learning optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 As hubs of human activity, urban surfaces consist of a wealth of semantic entities. Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate our approach's gains over state-of-the-art models and strong zero-shot generalization. Our dataset and code are available in https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SocioReasoner.

A novel framework injects semantic intent into Mixture-of-Experts routing for image generation and editing, resolving task interference through hierarchical task annotation and predictive alignment regularization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Unified image generation and editing models suffer from severe task interference in dense diffusion transformers architectures, where a shared parameter space must compromise between conflicting objectives (e.g., local editing v.s. subject-driven generation). While the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm is a promising solution, its gating networks remain task-agnostic, operating based on local features, unaware of global task intent. This task-agnostic nature prevents meaningful specialization and fails to resolve the underlying task interference. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to inject semantic intent into MoE routing. We introduce a Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation scheme to create structured task descriptors (e.g., scope, type, preservation). We then design Predictive Alignment Regularization to align internal routing decisions with the task's high-level semantics. This regularization evolves the gating network from a task-agnostic executor to a dispatch center. Our model effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming dense baselines in fidelity and quality, and our analysis shows that experts naturally develop clear and semantically correlated specializations.

A logic-structured training framework explicitly models instruction logic through constraint-aware reward mechanisms, improving instruction-following and reasoning capabilities in large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Instruction-following is critical for large language models, but real-world instructions often contain logical structures such as sequential dependencies and conditional branching. Existing methods typically construct datasets with parallel constraints and optimize average rewards, ignoring logical dependencies and yielding noisy signals. We propose a logic-structured training framework LSRIF that explicitly models instruction logic. We first construct a dataset LSRInstruct with constraint structures such as parallel, sequential, and conditional types, and then design structure-aware rewarding method LSRIF including average aggregation for parallel structures, failure-penalty propagation for sequential structures, and selective rewards for conditional branches. Experiments show LSRIF brings significant improvements in instruction-following (in-domain and out-of-domain) and general reasoning. Analysis reveals that learning with explicit logic structures brings parameter updates in attention layers and sharpens token-level attention to constraints and logical operators.

Авторы создали dataset LSRInstruct с различными типами логических структур: параллельными, последовательными и условными ветвлениями, а затем разработали метод LSRIF для структурированного расчета вознаграждений. Метод использует разные стратегии награждения в зависимости от типа структуры: агрегацию вознаграждений для параллельных операций, распространение штрафов за ошибки в последовательностях и селективные награды для условных ветвлений. Экспериментальные результаты показывают, что такой подход значительно улучшает способность моделей следовать инструкциям и выполнять рассуждения как на обучающих, так и на новых данных.",

"A logic-structured training framework explicitly models instruction logic through constraint-aware reward mechanisms, improving instruction-following and reasoning capabilities in large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Instruction-following is critical for large language models, but real-world instructions often contain logical structures such as sequential dependencies and conditional branching. Existing methods typically construct datasets with parallel constraints and optimize average rewards, ignoring logical dependencies and yielding noisy signals. We propose a logic-structured training framework LSRIF that explicitly models instruction logic. We first construct a dataset LSRInstruct with constraint structures such as parallel, sequential, and conditional types, and then design structure-aware rewarding method LSRIF including average aggregation for parallel structures, failure-penalty propagation for sequential structures, and selective rewards for conditional branches. Experiments show LSRIF brings significant improvements in instruction-following (in-domain and out-of-domain) and general reasoning. Analysis reveals that learning with explicit logic structures brings parameter updates in attention layers and sharpens token-level attention to constraints and logical operators."

**Justification:**

1. **DATASET**: The paper introduces "LSRInstruct," a new dataset constructed with constraint structures (parallel, sequential, and conditional types).

2. **TRAINING**: The paper proposes "LSRIF," a logic-structured training framework that improves model training through structure-aware reward mechanisms and explicit modeling of instruction logic.

3. **RLHF**: The paper employs reward-based mechanisms (average aggregation, failure-penalty propagation, selective rewards) to optimize model behavior, which is characteristic of reinforcement learning from human feedback approaches.
