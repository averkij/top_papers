[ 1 7 5 6 0 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r aLarge Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful operators for evolutionary search, yet the design of efficient search scaffolds remains ad hoc. While promising, current LLMin-the-loop systems lack systematic approach to managing the evolutionary process. We identify three distinct failure modes: Context Pollution, where experiment history biases future candidate generation; Mode Collapse, where agents stagnate in local minima due to poor exploration-exploitation balance; and Weak Collaboration, where rigid crossover strategies fail to leverage parallel search trajectories effectively. We introduce Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution (PACEvolve), framework designed to robustly govern the agents context and search dynamics, to address these challenges. PACEvolve combines hierarchical context management (HCM) with pruning to address context pollution; momentum-based backtracking (MBB) to escape local minima; and selfadaptive sampling policy that unifies backtracking and crossover for dynamic search coordination (CE), allowing agents to balance internal refinement with cross-trajectory collaboration. We demonstrate that PACEvolve provides systematic path to consistent, long-horizon selfimprovement, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLM-SR and KernelBench, and surpassing the record on Modded NanoGPT. 1. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used by evolutionary processes to optimize challenging scientific and engineering problems (Novikov et al., 2025; Romera- *Equal contribution . Work done during an internship at Google. 1Google 2University of Wisconsin-Madison 3University of California San Diego. Correspondence to: Minghao Yan <myan@cs.wisc.edu>. Paredes et al., 2024; Lange et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2025b; Lange et al., 2025). They transform evolutionary search by replacing the rigid, random operators of classical algorithms (such as mutation and crossover) with intelligent, contextaware reasoning (Novikov et al., 2025; Romera-Paredes et al., 2024; Lange et al., 2025). Unlike traditional Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) that evaluate an extensive number of weakly-guided candidates (> 106 samples) (Fogel, 1988; Holland, 1992), LLM-driven agents leverage in-context evolution history to perform iterative refinement (Novikov et al., 2025). By treating the history as dynamic knowledge base, these agents can theoretically learn from failures and perform meta-reasoning, shifting the paradigm toward sampleefficient, knowledge-guided optimization (Zhai et al., 2025; Lange et al., 2025). Our work aims to use these intelligent search priors to unlock state-of-the-art performance in complex research and engineering tasks (Shojaee et al., 2024; Ouyang et al., 2025a; Jordan et al., 2024). However, this new LLM-in-the-loop paradigm introduces significant instability, preventing the search from consistently leveraging the LLMs reasoning capabilities (Xia et al., 2025; Kim et al., 2025). Rather than steadily improving, these systems suffer from high variance (2), often failing to produce reliable improvements due to the combined stochasticity of the LLM and the search process (Comanici et al., 2025; Renze, 2024). Despite many successes in applying LLM-based evolutionary search to diverse tasks (Novikov et al., 2025; Lange et al., 2025), we lack systematic and principled understanding of how to improve the evolution scaffold, often relying on ad hoc designs. In this work, we aim to answer the central research question: How should we build an agent scaffold for an LLMdriven evolutionary search process? We identify three core challenges that hinder the performance of modern LLM-assisted evolutionary agents (2): First, Context Pollution overwhelms the agent history with failed hypotheses due to reward sparsity (Liu et al., 2025a), which degrades the quality of generated ideas (Anthony et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025). Second, Mode Collapse occurs when the agent fails to balance exploration and ex1 PACEvolve We demonstrate state-of-the-art empirical performance, significantly outperforming existing methods on diverse and complex benchmarks, including Symbolic Regression (LLM-SR) and KernelBench, and surpassing prior records on Modded NanoGPT. 2. Motivation Traditional evolutionary algorithms rely on fixed set of operators, such as mutation and crossover. In contrast, LLMbased search can perform intelligent, context-aware operations, rewriting entire solutions based on rich prompt that includes past experimental history. Existing evolutionary agent scaffolds follow an executionand-reflection paradigm, in which an LLM operates closed loop comprising idea sampling, execution, feedback collection, and reflection (Novikov et al., 2025; Lange et al., 2025). Though promising, evolutionary agents still yield sub-optimal performance when applied to critical scientific and coding challenges, such as symbolic regression (Shojaee et al., 2024) and kernel design (Ouyang et al., 2025a; Liao et al., 2025). As an example, consider the three independent evolution trajectories on symbolic regression in Figure 3. We observe that if the evolutionary search cannot quickly find low-NMSE solution, it is unlikely to discover better solutions later. We hypothesize this is due to summarized experiment histories, which serve as context for future iterations, biasing LLMs towards generating similar ideas rather than exploring completely different paths. In this paper, we conduct systematic empirical study to identify the key challenges in designing evolutionary agent skeletons, summarized as follows: 1. Context Pollution disincentivizes diverse candidate generation. LLM-assisted evolutionary agents rely on their context to guide reflection and idea sampling; context quality is critical to agent performance (Anthony et al., 2025). However, successful discoveries are naturally sparse (Liu et al., 2025a). Consequently, as the agent progresses, the context rapidly saturates with failed attempts (trials yielding no performance gain). As the experimental history grows, self-reinforcing feedback loop forms, leading LLMs to persist with flawed hypotheses, even in the face of negative res"

Text:"Patient-Similarity Cohort Reasoning in Clinical Text-to-SQL Yifei ShenW Yilun Zhao Y6 2 0 2 4 1 ] . [ 1 6 7 8 9 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r aReal-world clinical text-to-SQL requires reasoning over heterogeneous EHR tables, temporal windows, and patient-similarity cohorts to produce executable queries. We introduce CLINSQL, benchmark of 633 expertannotated tasks on MIMIC-IV v3.1 that demands multi-table joins, clinically meaningful filters, and executable SQL. Solving CLINSQL entails navigating schema metadata and clinical coding systems, handling long contexts, and composing multi-step queries beyond traditional text-to-SQL. We evaluate 22 proprietary and open-source models under Chain-ofThought self-refinement and use rubric-based SQL analysis with execution checks that prioritize critical clinical requirements. Despite recent advances, performance remains far from clinical reliability: on the test set, GPT-5-mini attains 74.7% execution score, DeepSeek-R1 leads open-source at 69.2% and Gemini-2.5Pro drops from 85.5% on Easy to 67.2% on Hard. Progress on CLINSQL marks tangible advances toward clinically reliable text-to-SQL for real-world EHR analytics. Data Code yifeis02/ClinSQL Barryshen1/ClinSQLAutomating clinical data analysis requires bridging natural-language questions from clinicians to executable queries over complex electronic health record (EHR) databases. While large language models (LLMs) have recently excelled at text-toSQL and database reasoning on general-domain benchmarks (Yu et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025), real-world clinical analysis presents distinct challenges: specialized medical terminology, fine-grained temporal reasoning across heterogeneous tables, and cohort-level clinical reasoning Equal Contributions. Correspondence: Yilun Zhao (yilun.zhao@yale.edu) Figure 1: Overview of the CLINSQL benchmark. that goes beyond point retrieval to compare similar patients under clinically meaningful constraints (Yu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2024). These requirements are not merely larger versions of the classic text-to-SQL problem; they demand workflows that integrate domain knowledge, temporal windows, coding systems, and outcome-aware analytics over longitudinal data (Johnson et al., 2023). Foundational text-to-SQL evaluations (e.g., WikiSQL, Spider 1.0, BIRD) catalyze progress on cross-domain parsing and database generalization (Zhong et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2023). Recent enterprise-style benchmarks (i.e., Spider 2.0) further expose challenges from large schemas, diverse SQL dialects, and multi-step workflows (Wei et al., 2024). However, clinical settings introduce additional, domain-specific hurdles: temporal abstractions (e.g., first 24/48/72 hours), clinical ranges/units, ICD/medication coding, and cohort construction for outcome comparison. Prior clinical text-to-SQL datasets, notably MIMICSQL (Wang et al., 2020) and EHRSQL (Lee et al., 2022), demonstrate feasibility on EHR schemas but predominantly emphasize single-patient or statistical summaries and seldom require patientsimilarity cohort reasoning central to real-world clinical decision making.

PACEvolve framework addresses key failure modes in LLM evolutionary search through hierarchical context management, momentum-based backtracking, and adaptive sampling policies for improved self-improvement and solution discovery.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful operators for evolutionary search, yet the design of efficient search scaffolds remains ad hoc. While promising, current LLM-in-the-loop systems lack a systematic approach to managing the evolutionary process. We identify three distinct failure modes: Context Pollution, where experiment history biases future candidate generation; Mode Collapse, where agents stagnate in local minima due to poor exploration-exploitation balance; and Weak Collaboration, where rigid crossover strategies fail to leverage parallel search trajectories effectively. We introduce Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution (PACEvolve), a framework designed to robustly govern the agent's context and search dynamics, to address these challenges. PACEvolve combines hierarchical context management (HCM) with pruning to address context pollution; momentum-based backtracking (MBB) to escape local minima; and a self-adaptive sampling policy that unifies backtracking and crossover for dynamic search coordination (CE), allowing agents to balance internal refinement with cross-trajectory collaboration. We demonstrate that PACEvolve provides a systematic path to consistent, long-horizon self-improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLM-SR and KernelBench, while discovering solutions surpassing the record on Modded NanoGPT.

CLINSQL benchmark evaluates text-to-SQL models on complex clinical tasks requiring multi-table joins, temporal reasoning, and patient similarity analysis from real-world EHR data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Real-world clinical text-to-SQL requires reasoning over heterogeneous EHR tables, temporal windows, and patient-similarity cohorts to produce executable queries. We introduce CLINSQL, a benchmark of 633 expert-annotated tasks on MIMIC-IV v3.1 that demands multi-table joins, clinically meaningful filters, and executable SQL. Solving CLINSQL entails navigating schema metadata and clinical coding systems, handling long contexts, and composing multi-step queries beyond traditional text-to-SQL. We evaluate 22 proprietary and open-source models under Chain-of-Thought self-refinement and use rubric-based SQL analysis with execution checks that prioritize critical clinical requirements. Despite recent advances, performance remains far from clinical reliability: on the test set, GPT-5-mini attains 74.7% execution score, DeepSeek-R1 leads open-source at 69.2% and Gemini-2.5-Pro drops from 85.5% on Easy to 67.2% on Hard. Progress on CLINSQL marks tangible advances toward clinically reliable text-to-SQL for real-world EHR analytics.

"CLINSQL benchmark evaluates text-to-SQL models on complex clinical tasks requiring multi-table joins, temporal reasoning, and patient similarity analysis from real-world EHR data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Real-world clinical text-to-SQL requires reasoning over heterogeneous EHR tables, temporal windows, and patient-similarity cohorts to produce executable queries. We introduce CLINSQL, a benchmark of 633 expert-annotated tasks on MIMIC-IV v3.1 that demands multi-table joins, clinically meaningful filters, and executable SQL. Solving CLINSQL entails navigating schema metadata and clinical coding systems, handling long contexts, and composing multi-step queries beyond traditional text-to-SQL. We evaluate 22 proprietary and open-source models under Chain-of-Thought self-refinement and use rubric-based SQL analysis with execution checks that prioritize critical clinical requirements. Despite recent advances, performance remains far from clinical reliability: on the test set, GPT-5-mini attains 74.7% execution score, DeepSeek-R1 leads open-source at 69.2% and Gemini-2.5-Pro drops from 85.5% on Easy to 67.2% on Hard. Progress on CLINSQL marks tangible advances toward clinically reliable text-to-SQL for real-world EHR analytics."

Dynamic Point Maps extended to video input through V-DPM framework achieve state-of-the-art 3D and 4D reconstruction by recovering both dynamic depth and full 3D motion of scene points.  					AI-generated summary 				 Powerful 3D representations such as DUSt3R invariant point maps, which encode 3D shape and camera parameters, have significantly advanced feed forward 3D reconstruction. While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes. In particular, unlike recent dynamic extensions of VGGT such as P3, DPMs recover not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene.
