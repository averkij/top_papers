Text:"2024-12-20 Qwen2.5 Technical Reporthttps://huggingface.co/Qwen https://modelscope.cn/organization/qwen https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.In this report, we introduce Qwen2.5, comprehensive series of large language models (LLMs) designed to meet diverse needs. Compared to previous iterations, Qwen 2.5 has been significantly improved during both the pre-training and post-training stages. In terms of pre-training, we have scaled the high-quality pre-training datasets from the previous 7 trillion tokens to 18 trillion tokens. This provides strong foundation for common sense, expert knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. In terms of post-training, we implement intricate supervised finetuning with over 1 million samples, as well as multistage reinforcement learning, including offline learning DPO and online learning GRPO. Post-training techniques significantly enhance human preference, and notably improve long text generation, structural data analysis, and instruction following. To handle diverse and varied use cases effectively, we present Qwen2.5 LLM series in rich configurations. The open-weight offerings include base models and instruction-tuned models in sizes of 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B, and 72B parameters. Quantized versions of the instruction-tuned models are also provided. Over 100 models can be accessed from Hugging Face Hub, ModelScope, and Kaggle. In addition, for hosted solutions, the proprietary models currently include two mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants: Qwen2.5Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus, both available from Alibaba Cloud Model Studio. Qwen2.5 has demonstrated top-tier performance on wide range of benchmarks evaluating language understanding, reasoning, mathematics, coding, human preference alignment, etc. Specifically, the open-weight flagship Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct outperforms number of open and proprietary models and demonstrates competitive performance to the state-of-the-art open-weight model, Llama-3-405B-Instruct, which is around 5 times larger. Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus offer superior cost-effectiveness while performing competitively against GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o respectively. Additionally, as the foundation, Qwen2.5 models have been instrumental in training specialized models such as Qwen2.5-Math (Yang et al., 2024b), Qwen2.5-Coder (Hui et al., 2024), QwQ (Qwen Team, 2024d), and multimodal models. 4 2 0 2 9 1 ] . [ 1 5 1 1 5 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r Figure 1: In the iterative development of the Qwen series, data scaling has played crucial role. Qwen 2.5, which leverages 18 trillion tokens for pre-training, has demonstrated the most advanced capabilities within the Qwen series, especially in terms of domain expertise, underscoring the importance of scale together with mixture in enhancing the models capabilities.The sparks of artificial general intelligence (AGI) are increasingly visible through the fast development of large foundation models, notably large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023; 2024a; Gemini Team, 2024; Anthropic, 2023a;b; 2024; Bai et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024a; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Dubey et al., 2024). The continuous advancement in model and data scaling, combined with the paradigm of large-scale pre-training followed by high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022), has enabled large language models (LLMs) to develop emergent capabilities in language understanding, generation, and reasoning. Building on this foundation, recent breakthroughs in inference time scaling, particularly demonstrated by o1 (OpenAI, 2024b), have enhanced LLMs capacity for deep thinking through step-by-step reasoning and reflection. These developments have elevated the potential of language models, suggesting they may achieve significant breakthroughs in scientific exploration as they continue to demonstrate emergent capabilities indicative of more general artificial intelligence. Besides the fast development of model capabilities, the recent two years have witnessed burst of open (open-weight) large language models in the LLM community, for example, the Llama series (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Dubey et al., 2024), Mistral series (Jiang et al., 2023a; 2024), and our Qwen series (Bai et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024a; Qwen Team, 2024a; Hui et al., 2024; Qwen Team, 2024c; Yang et al., 2024b). The open-weight models have democratized the access of large language models to common users and developers, enabling broader research participation, fostering innovation through community collaboration, and accelerating the development of AI applications across diverse domains. Recently, we release the details of our latest version of the Qwen series, Qwen2.5. In terms of the openweight part, we release pre-trained and instruction-tuned models of 7 sizes, including 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B, and 72B, and we provide not only the original models in bfloat16 precision but also the quantized models in different precisions. Specifically, the flagship model Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct demonstrates competitive performance against the state-of-the-art open-weight model, Llama-3-405B-Instruct, which is around 5 times larger. Additionally, we also release the proprietary models of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE, Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022; Zoph et al., 2022), namely Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus1, which performs competitively against GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o respectively. In this technical report, we introduce Qwen2.5, the result of our continuous endeavor to create better LLMs. Below, we show the key features of the latest version of Qwen: Better in Size: Compared with Qwen2, in addition to 0.5B, 1.5B, 7B, and 72B models, Qwen2.5 brings back the 3B, 14B, and 32B models, which are more cost-effective for resource-limited scenarios and are under-represented in the current field of open foundation models. Qwen2.5Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus offer great balance among accuracy, latency, and cost. Better in Data: The pre-training and post-training data have been improved significantly. The pre-training data increased from 7 trillion tokens to 18 trillion tokens, with focus on knowledge, coding, and mathematics. The pre-training is staged to allow transitions among different mixtures. The post-training data amounts to 1 million examples, across the stage of supervised finetuning (SFT, Ouyang et al., 2022), direct preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al., 2023), and group relative policy optimization (GRP"

"In this report, we introduce Qwen2.5, a comprehensive series of large language models (LLMs) designed to meet diverse needs. Compared to previous iterations, Qwen 2.5 has been significantly improved during both the pre-training and post-training stages. In terms of pre-training, we have scaled the high-quality pre-training datasets from the previous 7 trillion tokens to 18 trillion tokens. This provides a strong foundation for common sense, expert knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. In terms of post-training, we implement intricate supervised finetuning with over 1 million samples, as well as multistage reinforcement learning.

Multi-step multimodal reasoning tasks pose significant challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and finding effective ways to enhance their performance in such scenarios remains an unresolved issue. In this paper, we propose AR-MCTS, a universal framework designed to progressively improve the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs through Active Retrieval (AR) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our approach begins with the development of a unified retrieval module that retrieves key supporting insights for solving complex reasoning problems from a hybrid-modal retrieval corpus. To bridge the gap in automated multimodal reasoning verification, we employ the MCTS algorithm combined with an active retrieval mechanism, which enables the automatic generation of step-wise annotations. This strategy dynamically retrieves key insights for each reasoning step, moving beyond traditional beam search sampling to improve the diversity and reliability of the reasoning space. Additionally, we introduce a process reward model that aligns progressively to support the automatic verification of multimodal reasoning tasks. Experimental results across three complex multimodal reasoning benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of the AR-MCTS framework in enhancing the performance of various multimodal models. Further analysis demonstrates that AR-MCTS can optimize sampling diversity and accuracy, yielding reliable multimodal reasoning.

Despite the rapidly growing demand for multimodal retrieval, progress in this field remains severely constrained by a lack of training data. In this paper, we introduce MegaPairs, a novel data synthesis method that leverages vision language models (VLMs) and open-domain images, together with a massive synthetic dataset generated from this method. Our empirical analysis shows that MegaPairs generates high-quality data, enabling the multimodal retriever to significantly outperform the baseline model trained on 70times more data from existing datasets. Moreover, since MegaPairs solely relies on general image corpora and open-source VLMs, it can be easily scaled up, enabling continuous improvements in retrieval performance. In this stage, we produced more than 26 million training instances and trained several models of varying sizes using this data. These new models achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across 4 popular composed image retrieval (CIR) benchmarks and the highest overall performance on the 36 datasets provided by MMEB. They also demonstrate notable performance improvements with additional downstream fine-tuning. Our produced dataset, well-trained models, and data synthesis pipeline will be made publicly available to facilitate the future development of this field.

This paper introduces LongBench v2, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to handle long-context problems requiring deep understanding and reasoning across real-world multitasks. LongBench v2 consists of 503 challenging multiple-choice questions, with contexts ranging from 8k to 2M words, across six major task categories: single-document QA, multi-document QA, long in-context learning, long-dialogue history understanding, code repository understanding, and long structured data understanding. To ensure the breadth and the practicality, we collect data from nearly 100 highly educated individuals with diverse professional backgrounds. We employ both automated and manual review processes to maintain high quality and difficulty, resulting in human experts achieving only 53.7% accuracy under a 15-minute time constraint. Our evaluation reveals that the best-performing model, when directly answers the questions, achieves only 50.1% accuracy. In contrast, the o1-preview model, which includes longer reasoning, achieves 57.7%, surpassing the human baseline by 4%. These results highlight the importance of enhanced reasoning ability and scaling inference-time compute to tackle the long-context challenges in LongBench v2. The project is available at https://longbench2.github.io.

"This paper introduces LongBench v2, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to handle long-context problems requiring deep understanding and reasoning across real-world multitasks. LongBench v2 consists of 503 challenging multiple-choice questions, with contexts ranging from 8k to 2M words, across six major task categories: single-document QA, multi-document QA, long in-context learning, long-dialogue history understanding, code repository understanding, and long structured data understanding. To ensure the breadth and the practicality, we collect data from nearly 100 highly educated individuals with diverse professional backgrounds. We employ both automated and manual review processes to maintain high quality and difficulty, resulting in human experts achieving only 53.7% accuracy under a 15-minute time constraint. Our evaluation reveals that the best-performing model, when directly answers the questions, achieves only 50.1% accuracy. In contrast, the o1-preview model, which includes longer reasoning, achieves 57.7%, surpassing the human baseline by 4%. These results highlight the importance of enhanced reasoning ability and scaling inference-time compute to tackle the long-context challenges in LongBench v2.

In this paper, we propose Text-based Open Molecule Generation Benchmark (TOMG-Bench), the first benchmark to evaluate the open-domain molecule generation capability of LLMs. TOMG-Bench encompasses a dataset of three major tasks: molecule editing (MolEdit), molecule optimization (MolOpt), and customized molecule generation (MolCustom). Each task further contains three subtasks, with each subtask comprising 5,000 test samples. Given the inherent complexity of open molecule generation, we have also developed an automated evaluation system that helps measure both the quality and the accuracy of the generated molecules. Our comprehensive benchmarking of 25 LLMs reveals the current limitations and potential areas for improvement in text-guided molecule discovery. Furthermore, with the assistance of OpenMolIns, a specialized instruction tuning dataset proposed for solving challenges raised by TOMG-Bench, Llama3.1-8B could outperform all the open-source general LLMs, even surpassing GPT-3.5-turbo by 46.5\% on TOMG-Bench. Our codes and datasets are available through https://github.com/phenixace/TOMG-Bench.

Diffusion models, and their generalization, flow matching, have had a remarkable impact on the field of media generation. Here, the conventional approach is to learn the complex mapping from a simple source distribution of Gaussian noise to the target media distribution. For cross-modal tasks such as text-to-image generation, this same mapping from noise to image is learnt whilst including a conditioning mechanism in the model. One key and thus far relatively unexplored feature of flow matching is that, unlike Diffusion models, they are not constrained for the source distribution to be noise. Hence, in this paper, we propose a paradigm shift, and ask the question of whether we can instead train flow matching models to learn a direct mapping from the distribution of one modality to the distribution of another, thus obviating the need for both the noise distribution and conditioning mechanism. We present a general and simple framework, CrossFlow, for cross-modal flow matching. We show the importance of applying Variational Encoders to the input data, and introduce a method to enable Classifier-free guidance. Surprisingly, for text-to-image, CrossFlow with a vanilla transformer without cross attention slightly outperforms standard flow matching, and we show that it scales better with training steps and model size, while also allowing for interesting latent arithmetic which results in semantically meaningful edits in the output space. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we also show that CrossFlow is on par with or outperforms the state-of-the-art for various cross-modal / intra-modal mapping tasks, viz. image captioning, depth estimation, and image super-resolution. We hope this paper contributes to accelerating progress in cross-modal media generation.

We propose an unsupervised model for instruction-based image editing that eliminates the need for ground-truth edited images during training. Existing supervised methods depend on datasets containing triplets of input image, edited image, and edit instruction. These are generated by either existing editing methods or human-annotations, which introduce biases and limit their generalization ability. Our method addresses these challenges by introducing a novel editing mechanism called Cycle Edit Consistency (CEC), which applies forward and backward edits in one training step and enforces consistency in image and attention spaces. This allows us to bypass the need for ground-truth edited images and unlock training for the first time on datasets comprising either real image-caption pairs or image-caption-edit triplets. We empirically show that our unsupervised technique performs better across a broader range of edits with high fidelity and precision. By eliminating the need for pre-existing datasets of triplets, reducing biases associated with supervised methods, and proposing CEC, our work represents a significant advancement in unblocking scaling of instruction-based image editing.

  "desc": "Авторы предлагают неконтролируемую модель для редактирования изображений на основе инструкций, которая устраняет необходимость в размеченных данных во время обучения. Метод вводит новый механизм редактирования под названием Cycle Edit Consistency (CEC), который применяет прямые и обратные правки в одном шаге обучения и обеспечивает согласованность в пространствах изображений и внимания. Это позволяет обучать модель на наборах данных, состоящих из пар изображение-подпись или триплетов изображение-подпись-правка, без необходимости в заранее отредактированных изображениях. Эмпирически показано, что предложенный неконтролируемый метод работает лучше для более широкого спектра правок с высокой точностью и достоверностью.",
