Text:"2024-12-6 Marco-LLM: Bridging Languages via Massive Multilingual Training for Cross-Lingual Enhancement Lingfeng Ming*, Bo Zeng*, Chenyang Lyu*, Tianqi Shi, Yu Zhao, Xue Yang, Yefeng Liu, Yiyu Wang, Linlong Xu, Yangyang Liu, Xiaohu Zhao, Hao Wang, Heng Liu, Hao Zhou, Huifeng Yin, Zifu Shang, Haijun Li, Longyue Wang, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang MarcoPolo Team, Alibaba International Digital Commerce Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in recent years; however, their excellent performance is still largely limited to major world languages, primarily English. Many LLMs continue to face challenges with multilingual tasks, especially when it comes to low-resource languages. To address this issue, we introduced Marco-LLM: Massive multilingual training for cross-lingual enhancement LLM. We have collected substantial amount of multilingual data for several low-resource languages and conducted extensive continual pre-training using the Qwen2 models. This effort has resulted in multilingual LLM named Marco-LLM. Through comprehensive evaluations on various multilingual benchmarks, including MMMLU, AGIEval, Belebele, Flores-200, XCOPA and many others, Marco-LLM has demonstrated substantial improvements over state-of-the-art LLMs. Furthermore, Marco-LLM achieved substantial enhancements in any-to-any machine translation tasks, showing the effectiveness of our multilingual LLM. Marco-LLM is pioneering multilingual LLM designed to not only perform exceptionally well in multilingual tasks, including low-resource languages, but also maintain strong performance in English and other major languages, closing the performance gap between highand low-resource language capabilities. By bridging languages, this effort demonstrates our dedication to ensuring LLMs work accurately across various languages. 4 2 0 2 ] .

Diffusion models excel in generating high-quality images. However, current diffusion models struggle to produce reliable images without guidance methods, such as classifier-free guidance (CFG). Are guidance methods truly necessary? Observing that noise obtained via diffusion inversion can reconstruct high-quality images without guidance, we focus on the initial noise of the denoising pipeline. By mapping Gaussian noise to `guidance-free noise', we uncover that small low-magnitude low-frequency components significantly enhance the denoising process, removing the need for guidance and thus improving both inference throughput and memory. Expanding on this, we propose \ours, a novel method that replaces guidance methods with a single refinement of the initial noise. This refined noise enables high-quality image generation without guidance, within the same diffusion pipeline. Our noise-refining model leverages efficient noise-space learning, achieving rapid convergence and strong performance with just 50K text-image pairs. We validate its effectiveness across diverse metrics and analyze how refined noise can eliminate the need for guidance. See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/NoiseRefine/.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in recent years; however, their excellent performance is still largely limited to major world languages, primarily English. Many LLMs continue to face challenges with multilingual tasks, especially when it comes to low-resource languages. To address this issue, we introduced Marco-LLM: Massive multilingual training for cross-lingual enhancement LLM. We have collected a substantial amount of multilingual data for several low-resource languages and conducted extensive continual pre-training using the Qwen2 models. This effort has resulted in a multilingual LLM named Marco-LLM. Through comprehensive evaluations on various multilingual benchmarks, including MMMLU, AGIEval, Belebele, Flores-200, XCOPA and many others, Marco-LLM has demonstrated substantial improvements over state-of-the-art LLMs. Furthermore, Marco-LLM achieved substantial enhancements in any-to-any machine translation tasks, showing the effectiveness of our multilingual LLM. Marco-LLM is a pioneering multilingual LLM designed to not only perform exceptionally well in multilingual tasks, including low-resource languages, but also maintain strong performance in English and other major languages, closing the performance gap between high- and low-resource language capabilities. By bridging languages, this effort demonstrates our dedication to ensuring LLMs work accurately across various languages.
