Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are critical to human-computer interaction, yet automating GUI tasks remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of visual environments. Existing approaches often rely on textual representations of GUIs, which introduce limitations in generalization, efficiency, and scalability. In this paper, we introduce Aguvis, a unified pure vision-based framework for autonomous GUI agents that operates across various platforms. Our approach leverages image-based observations, and grounding instructions in natural language to visual elements, and employs a consistent action space to ensure cross-platform generalization. To address the limitations of previous work, we integrate explicit planning and reasoning within the model, enhancing its ability to autonomously navigate and interact with complex digital environments. We construct a large-scale dataset of GUI agent trajectories, incorporating multimodal reasoning and grounding, and employ a two-stage training pipeline that first focuses on general GUI grounding, followed by planning and reasoning. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Aguvis surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both offline and real-world online scenarios, achieving, to our knowledge, the first fully autonomous pure vision GUI agent capable of performing tasks independently without collaboration with external closed-source models. We open-sourced all datasets, models, and training recipes to facilitate future research at https://aguvis-project.github.io/.

We construct a large-scale dataset of GUI agent trajectories, incorporating multimodal reasoning and grounding, and employ a two-stage training pipeline that first focuses on general GUI grounding, followed by planning and reasoning. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Aguvis surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both offline and real-world online scenarios, achieving, to our knowledge, the first fully autonomous pure vision GUI agent capable of performing tasks independently without collaboration with external closed-source models. We open-sourced all datasets, models, and training recipes to facilitate future research at https://aguvis-project.github.io/."

We introduce a novel 3D generation method for versatile and high-quality 3D asset creation. The cornerstone is a unified Structured LATent (SLAT) representation which allows decoding to different output formats, such as Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes. This is achieved by integrating a sparsely-populated 3D grid with dense multiview visual features extracted from a powerful vision foundation model, comprehensively capturing both structural (geometry) and textural (appearance) information while maintaining flexibility during decoding. We employ rectified flow transformers tailored for SLAT as our 3D generation models and train models with up to 2 billion parameters on a large 3D asset dataset of 500K diverse objects. Our model generates high-quality results with text or image conditions, significantly surpassing existing methods, including recent ones at similar scales. We showcase flexible output format selection and local 3D editing capabilities which were not offered by previous models. Code, model, and data will be released.

Recent advancements in vision-language models have enhanced performance by increasing the length of visual tokens, making them much longer than text tokens and significantly raising computational costs. However, we observe that the visual tokens generated by popular vision encoders, such as CLIP and SigLIP, contain significant redundancy. To address this, we introduce VisionZip, a simple yet effective method that selects a set of informative tokens for input to the language model, reducing visual token redundancy and improving efficiency while maintaining model performance. The proposed VisionZip can be widely applied to image and video understanding tasks and is well-suited for multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios, where previous methods tend to underperform. Experimental results show that VisionZip outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by at least 5% performance gains across nearly all settings. Moreover, our method significantly enhances model inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 8x and enabling the LLaVA-Next 13B model to infer faster than the LLaVA-Next 7B model while achieving better results. Furthermore, we analyze the causes of this redundancy and encourage the community to focus on extracting better visual features rather than merely increasing token length. Our code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionZip .

Medical image segmentation has recently demonstrated impressive progress with deep neural networks, yet the heterogeneous modalities and scarcity of mask annotations limit the development of segmentation models on unannotated modalities. This paper investigates a new paradigm for leveraging generative models in medical applications: controllably synthesizing data for unannotated modalities, without requiring registered data pairs. Specifically, we make the following contributions in this paper: (i) we collect and curate a large-scale radiology image-text dataset, MedGen-1M, comprising modality labels, attributes, region, and organ information, along with a subset of organ mask annotations, to support research in controllable medical image generation; (ii) we propose a diffusion-based data engine, termed MRGen, which enables generation conditioned on text prompts and masks, synthesizing MR images for diverse modalities lacking mask annotations, to train segmentation models on unannotated modalities; (iii) we conduct extensive experiments across various modalities, illustrating that our data engine can effectively synthesize training samples and extend MRI segmentation towards unannotated modalities.

Given the increasing use of synthetic data in language model (LM) post-training, an LM's ability to generate high-quality data has become nearly as crucial as its ability to solve problems directly. While prior works have focused on developing effective data generation methods, they lack systematic comparison of different LMs as data generators in a unified setting. To address this gap, we propose AgoraBench, a benchmark that provides standardized settings and metrics to evaluate LMs' data generation abilities. Through synthesizing 1.26 million training instances using 6 LMs and training 99 student models, we uncover key insights about LMs' data generation capabilities. First, we observe that LMs exhibit distinct strengths. For instance, GPT-4o excels at generating new problems, while Claude-3.5-Sonnet performs better at enhancing existing ones. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that an LM's data generation ability doesn't necessarily correlate with its problem-solving ability. Instead, multiple intrinsic features of data quality-including response quality, perplexity, and instruction difficulty-collectively serve as better indicators. Finally, we demonstrate that strategic choices in output format and cost-conscious model selection significantly impact data generation effectiveness.

We present HumanEdit, a high-quality, human-rewarded dataset specifically designed for instruction-guided image editing, enabling precise and diverse image manipulations through open-form language instructions. Previous large-scale editing datasets often incorporate minimal human feedback, leading to challenges in aligning datasets with human preferences. HumanEdit bridges this gap by employing human annotators to construct data pairs and administrators to provide feedback. With meticulously curation, HumanEdit comprises 5,751 images and requires more than 2,500 hours of human effort across four stages, ensuring both accuracy and reliability for a wide range of image editing tasks. The dataset includes six distinct types of editing instructions: Action, Add, Counting, Relation, Remove, and Replace, encompassing a broad spectrum of real-world scenarios. All images in the dataset are accompanied by masks, and for a subset of the data, we ensure that the instructions are sufficiently detailed to support mask-free editing. Furthermore, HumanEdit offers comprehensive diversity and high-resolution 1024 times 1024 content sourced from various domains, setting a new versatile benchmark for instructional image editing datasets. With the aim of advancing future research and establishing evaluation benchmarks in the field of image editing, we release HumanEdit at https://huggingface.co/datasets/BryanW/HumanEdit.

We introduce OmniFlow, a novel generative model designed for any-to-any generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-audio, and audio-to-image synthesis. OmniFlow advances the rectified flow (RF) framework used in text-to-image models to handle the joint distribution of multiple modalities. It outperforms previous any-to-any models on a wide range of tasks, such as text-to-image and text-to-audio synthesis. Our work offers three key contributions: First, we extend RF to a multi-modal setting and introduce a novel guidance mechanism, enabling users to flexibly control the alignment between different modalities in the generated outputs. Second, we propose a novel architecture that extends the text-to-image MMDiT architecture of Stable Diffusion 3 and enables audio and text generation. The extended modules can be efficiently pretrained individually and merged with the vanilla text-to-image MMDiT for fine-tuning. Lastly, we conduct a comprehensive study on the design choices of rectified flow transformers for large-scale audio and text generation, providing valuable insights into optimizing performance across diverse modalities. The Code will be available at https://github.com/jacklishufan/OmniFlows.

We present Infinity, a Bitwise Visual AutoRegressive Modeling capable of generating high-resolution, photorealistic images following language instruction. Infinity redefines visual autoregressive model under a bitwise token prediction framework with an infinite-vocabulary tokenizer & classifier and bitwise self-correction mechanism, remarkably improving the generation capacity and details. By theoretically scaling the tokenizer vocabulary size to infinity and concurrently scaling the transformer size, our method significantly unleashes powerful scaling capabilities compared to vanilla VAR. Infinity sets a new record for autoregressive text-to-image models, outperforming top-tier diffusion models like SD3-Medium and SDXL. Notably, Infinity surpasses SD3-Medium by improving the GenEval benchmark score from 0.62 to 0.73 and the ImageReward benchmark score from 0.87 to 0.96, achieving a win rate of 66%. Without extra optimization, Infinity generates a high-quality 1024x1024 image in 0.8 seconds, making it 2.6x faster than SD3-Medium and establishing it as the fastest text-to-image model. Models and codes will be released to promote further exploration of Infinity for visual generation and unified tokenizer modeling.
