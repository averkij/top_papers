Voyager is world-consistent video generation and reconstruction framework. Up: Voyager can generate 3D-consistent scene videos for world exploration following custom camera trajectories. Bottom: Voyager jointly generates aligned depth and RGB video for effective and direct 3D reconstruction. Real-world applications like video gaming and virtual reality often demand the ability to model 3D scenes that users can explore along custom camera trajectories. While significant progress has been made in generating 3D objects from text or images, creating long-range, 3D-consistent, explorable 3D Both authors contributed equally to this research. Corresponding author. scenes remains complex and challenging problem. In this work, we present Voyager, novel video diffusion framework that generates world-consistent 3D point-cloud sequences from single image with user-defined camera path. Unlike existing approaches, Voyager achieves end-to-end scene generation and reconstruction with inherent consistency across frames, eliminating the need for 3D reconstruction pipelines (e.g., structure-from-motion or 2 Tianyu Huang, Wangguandong Zheng, Tengfei Wang, Yuhao Liu et al. multi-view stereo). Our method integrates three key components: 1) WorldConsistent Video Diffusion: unified architecture that jointly generates aligned RGB and depth video sequences, conditioned on "

Voyager is a video diffusion framework that generates world-consistent 3D point-cloud sequences from a single image, enabling long-range, consistent 3D scene exploration with user-defined camera paths.  					AI-generated summary 				 Real-world applications like video gaming and virtual reality often demand the ability to model 3D scenes that users can explore along custom camera trajectories. While significant progress has been made in generating 3D objects from text or images, creating long-range, 3D-consistent, explorable 3D scenes remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we present Voyager, a novel video diffusion framework that generates world-consistent 3D point-cloud sequences from a single image with user-defined camera path. Unlike existing approaches, Voyager achieves end-to-end scene generation and reconstruction with inherent consistency across frames, eliminating the need for 3D reconstruction pipelines (e.g., structure-from-motion or multi-view stereo). Our method integrates three key components: 1) World-Consistent Video Diffusion: A unified architecture that jointly generates aligned RGB and depth video sequences, conditioned on existing world observation to ensure global coherence 2) Long-Range World Exploration: An efficient world cache with point culling and an auto-regressive inference with smooth video sampling for iterative scene extension with context-aware consistency, and 3) Scalable Data Engine: A video reconstruction pipeline that automates camera pose estimation and metric depth prediction for arbitrary videos, enabling large-scale, diverse training data curation without manual 3D annotations. Collectively, these designs result in a clear improvement over existing methods in visual quality and geometric accuracy, with versatile applications.

CASS is a dataset and model suite for GPU code transpilation at both source and assembly levels, achieving high accuracy and performance matching with native code.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce CASS, the first large-scale dataset and model suite for cross-architecture GPU code transpilation, targeting both source-level (CUDA leftrightarrow HIP) and assembly-level (Nvidia SASS leftrightarrow AMD RDNA3) translation. The dataset comprises 70k verified code pairs across host and device, addressing a critical gap in low-level GPU code portability. Leveraging this resource, we train the CASS family of domain-specific language models, achieving 95% source translation accuracy and 37.5% assembly translation accuracy, substantially outperforming commercial baselines such as GPT-4o, Claude, and Hipify. Our generated code matches native performance in over 85% of test cases, preserving runtime and memory behavior. To support rigorous evaluation, we introduce CASS-Bench, a curated benchmark spanning 16 GPU domains with ground-truth execution. All data, models, and evaluation tools are released as open source to foster progress in GPU compiler tooling, binary compatibility, and LLM-guided hardware translation. Dataset and benchmark are on https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/cass{blue{HuggingFace}}, with code at https://github.com/GustavoStahl/CASS{blue{GitHub}}.

VisCode-200K, a large-scale dataset for visualization, improves plot generation performance by integrating execution-grounded supervision and iterative code correction, outperforming open-source models and rivaling proprietary ones.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.
