Text:"Follow the Flow: Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution with Neurosymbolic Agents, Puneet Mathur *, Nedim Lipka , Franck Dernoncourt , Ryan A. Rossi , Vivek Gupta , Dinesh Manochamanans@umd.edu, puneetm@adobe.com 5 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 4 4 3 1 0 . 6 0 5 2 : r aFlowcharts are critical tool for visualizing decision-making processes. However, their non-linear structure and complex visual-textual relationships make it challenging to interpret them using LLMs, as vision-language models frequently hallucinate nonexistent connections and decision paths when analyzing these diagrams. This leads to compromised reliability for automated flowchart processing in critical domains such as logistics, health, and engineering. We introduce the task of Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution, which traces specific components grounding flowchart referring LLM response. Flowchart Attribution ensures the verifiability of LLM predictions and improves explainability by linking generated responses to the flowcharts structure. We propose FlowPathAgent, neurosymbolic agent that performs fine-grained post hoc attribution It first segthrough graph-based reasoning. ments the flowchart, then converts it into structured symbolic graph, and then employs an agentic approach to dynamically interact with the graph, to generate attribution paths. Additionally, we present FlowExplainBench, novel benchmark for evaluating flowchart attributions across diverse styles, domains, and question types. Experimental results show that FlowPathAgent mitigates visual hallucinations in LLM answers over flowchart QA, outperforming strong baselines by 10-14% on our proposed FlowExplainBench dataset.Flowcharts are fundamental tool for representing structured decision-making processes. Used across domains such as software engineering, business process modeling, and instructional design, flowcharts provide visual roadmap of logical operations, guiding both human users and automated systems (Charntaweekhun and Wangsiripitak, 2006; Perols and Perols, 2024; Zimmermann *Primary Research Mentor 1 Figure 1: Attribution (represented by ) with FlowPathAgent ensures logical consistency in flowchart-based reasoning. FlowPathAgent uses neurosymbolic approach to generate attribution paths ( ➊ & ➋) in the flowchart. This enhances interpretability and reliability in flowchart driven automated decision-making. et al., 2024; Ensmenger, 2016). Their structured yet visual nature makes them an effective medium for conveying procedural logic. However, interpreting flowcharts accurately is challenging due to their nonlinear structures (branching and loopbased control flow), where meaning emerges from the interplay between textual content, visual arrangement, and logical dependencies. Ambiguities in flowchart interpretation arise from diverse notational conventions, implicit relationships, and misinferred steps, making precise attribution of information sources difficult (Eppler et al., 2008). Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in flowchart processing (Singh et al., 2024). These models leverage both textual and visual information, allowing them to extract structural relationships, recognize decision nodes, and generate answers based on flowchart content. However, despite their capabilities, VLMs struggle with hallucination: the tendency to generate information that is not grounded in the input (Huang et al., 2024; Guan et al., 2024). In the context of flowcharts, hallucination can manifest as misidentifying decision nodes, producing incorrect logical pathways, or fabricating connections that do not exist in the original structure. This issue severely impacts the reliability of automated flowchart reasoning, particularly in high-stakes applications such as healthcare, software verification and process automation. Although VLMs have made significant progress in understanding flowcharts, prior work has mainly concentrated on flowchart parsing (Arbaz et al., 2024), conversion (Shukla et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022), and question-answering (Singh et al., 2024; Tannert et al., 2023), while overlooking the critical aspect of fine-grained attribution. While existing attribution methods (Huo et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023) focus on textual grounding, attributing responses to visual-textual elements like flowcharts presents unique challenges. It involves not just text recognition, but also interpreting the interconnected decision nodes, hierarchical structures, and conditional pathways that define flowchart semantics. Attribution serves as crucial mechanism for mitigating hallucination by explicitly tracing the paths in the flowchart that ground particular response, enabling rigorous evaluation of the models fidelity to the flowcharts logic, as illustrated in Fig 1. Such fine-grained attribution is fundamental for ensuring reliability, particularly when these systems are deployed in domains where verifiable decision-making is crucial. Main Results. We introduce Flowchart Attribution task aimed at identifying the optimal path within flowchart that grounds the models response. The optimal path aims to extract the most relevant sequence of nodes and edges that directly support the models reasoning, encompassing all the key decision points and actions involved in the prediction. To facilitate the evaluation of this task, we propose FlowExplainBench, novel benchmark that features diverse set of flowcharts with varying styles, domains, and question types. We introduce FlowPathAgent, neurosymbolic agent specifically designed to perform fine-grained as post-hoc flowchart attribution. Instead of relying solely on text-based or vision-based cues, FlowPathAgent integrates symbolic reasoning by using an agentic interface to interact with the flowchart as graph object. FlowPathAgent begins with segmenting flowcharts into distinct components, followed by constructing symbolically operable flowchart representations. These graphbased representations have direct correspondence to visual regions of the flowchart, enabling the model to interoperate between the visual and symbolic representations. We leverage graph tools to extract and manipulate these representations, allowing for identification of relevant nodes and edges. Our methodology facilitates precise attribution of the models reasoning steps to specific decision points within the flowchart, providing accurate and interpretable explanations of the models output.

Text:"DLP: Dynamic Layerwise Pruning in Large Language Models Yuli Chen 1 Bo Cheng 1 Jiale Han 2 Yingying Zhang 1 Yingting Li 1 Shuhao Zhang1. Introduction 5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 3 7 0 8 3 2 . 5 0 5 2 : r Pruning has recently been widely adopted to reduce the parameter scale and improve the inference efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). Mainstream pruning techniques often rely on uniform layerwise pruning strategies, which can lead to severe performance degradation at high sparsity levels. Recognizing the varying contributions of different layers in LLMs, recent studies have shifted their focus toward non-uniform layerwise pruning. However, these approaches often rely on pre-defined values, which can result in suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose novel method called Dynamic Layerwise Pruning (DLP). This approach adaptively determines the relative importance of each layer by integrating model weights with input activation information, assigning pruning rates accordingly. Experimental results show that DLP effectively preserves model performance at high sparsity levels across multiple LLMs. Specifically, at 70% sparsity, DLP reduces the perplexity of LLaMA27B by 7.79 and improves the average accuracy by 2.7% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

The core concept of pruning is to optimize resource utilization by eliminating redundant or less important parameters. SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023) implements layerby-layer and row-by-row greedy pruning strategy, ensuring that local optimizations have minimal impact on global performance. Recent studies (Xiao et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024) highlight the pivotal role of outliers in LLMs. Although outliers constitute small fraction of the model, they exert disproportionately large influence on predictive accuracy. Building on the emergence of outlier features in LLMs (Puccetti et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024), Wanda (Sun et al., 2024) introduces novel approach to evaluate weight importance by integrating the absolute weight values with the norm of the corresponding input activations. Although previous works (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024) have achieved satisfactory performance, they fail to account for the varying importance of different layers within the model, instead assigning uniform sparsity rate to all layers. This limitation leads to significant performance drop under high sparsity conditions. Inspired by the presence of outliers, Outlier Weighed Layerwise Sparsity (OWL) (Yin et al., 2024) introduces novel pruning paradigm that leverages the criticality of layers with higher proportion of outliers. Based on the principle that layers with higher proportion of outliers are more critical, OWL assigns different sparsity rates to each layer of LLMs. In comparison to uniform layerwise pruning (Zhu & Gupta, 2018), OWL demonstrates superior performance in preserving model accuracy. However, OWL still has certain limitations in practical applications. Its reliance on predefined criteria for outlier selection not only limits its adaptability to the dynamic needs of the model but also hinders the achievement of optimal performance. To address the above issue, we compute the unimportance of each layer from an inverse perspective, which is then DLP: Dynamic Layerwise Pruning in Large Language Models transformed into the relative importance between layers. Based on the principle that layers with higher importance should have lower sparsity, we allocate layerwise sparsity rates. Some previous works (He et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2023) use the median to identify redundant elements in model, assuming that central elements can be replaced by other elements from the same layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the median in LLMs through three empirical studies. Additionally, we inherently place more emphasis on outliers. Due to the medians insensitivity to outliers (Huber et al., 2001), it provides more accurate reflection of the central tendency of layer when the weights contain outliers. In this paper, we propose novel Dynamic Layerwise Pruning (DLP) method. DLP adaptively determines the importance of each layer by combining model weights with input activation information, offering greater flexibility in sparsity allocation. Our goal is to determine the layerwise importance of LLMs, which we first derive by identifying the layerwise unimportance and then applying an inversion operation to obtain relative importance. Specifically, we begin by calculating the unimportance of each Transformer block based on the median of model weights and input activation values in the same layer. We then evaluate the relative unimportance across layers, which leads to the determination of the models relative importance. Finally, pruning rates are assigned to each layer according to the principle that layers with higher importance should have lower sparsity. The pipeline of DLP is illustrated in Figure 1. We conduct comprehensive experimental evaluations across multiple mainstream LLMs with varying parameter sizes (ranging from 7B to 30B) and architectures (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023)). The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM pruning techniques, particularly at high sparsity levels. For instance, at 70% sparsity, DLP reduces the "

(b) highlights the datasets broad coverage across categories e.g., flare, fog, glassware, X-ray contraband.Diffusion models have recently achieved great success in various generation tasks, such as object removal. Nevertheless, existing image decomposition methods struggle to disentangle semi-transparent or transparent layer occlusions due to mask prior dependencies, static object assumptions, and the lack of datasets. In this paper, we explore novel task: Layer-Wise Decomposition of Alpha-Composited Images, aiming to recover constituent layers from single overlapped images under the condition of semi-transparent/transparent alpha layer non-linear occlusion. To address challenges in layer ambiguity, generalization, and data scarcity, we first introduce AlphaBlend, the first large-scale and high-quality dataset for transparent and semi-transparent layer decomposition, supporting six real-world subtasks (e.g., translucent flare removal, semi-transparent cell decomposition, glassware decomposition). Building on this dataset, we present DiffDecompose, diffusion transformer-based framework that learns the posterior over possible layer decompositions conditioned on the input image, semantic prompts, and blending type. Rather than regressing alpha mattes directly, DiffDecompose performs In-Context Decomposition, enabling the model to predict one or multiple layers without per-layer supervision, and introduces Layer Position Encoding Cloning to maintain pixel-level correspondence across layers. Extensive experiments on the proposed Equal contribution. Corresponding author. Preprint. Under review. AlphaBlend dataset and public LOGO dataset verify the effectiveness of DiffDecompose. The code and dataset will be available upon paper acceptance. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/Wangzt1121/DiffDecompose.With the development of diffusion models, image-to-image [42, 16, 62, 65] and text-to-image [6, 18, 10] generation methods have been extensively studied and have wide applications in image inpainting [12, 49, 61, 59], video generation [5, 58, 76, 60], and image segmentation [36, 2, 22] to obtain high-quality images and user-friendly interfaces. Most existing approaches rely on mask-based constraints to guide the model toward modifying or preserving specific image regions, or assume temporal consistency by treating moving object information as static to infer future or missing frames. Despite their success, these methods face two major limitations when applied to more complex and realistic scenarios. Firstly, the assumption of known separation regions or static objects is too simple, making it difficult to apply to more complex scenarios. Secondly, the noise in the diffusion models forward phase may destroy the images original information, reducing the image contexts usability. Recently, new type of method, termed layer-wise decomposition [53, 64, 71, 30, 13, 3, 21], has gradually entered the field of computer vision and become potential method to solve the problem of these generative models. The core objective of layer-wise decomposition is to decompose single composited image into its constituent layers, each containing the foreground object, its associated alpha matte (transparency), and potential depth ordering. Such decomposition enables more granular control over individual layers, allowing for other tasks such as image inpainting [44], matting [35], scene understanding [66], and content creation [52]. Nonetheless, these decomposing methods will fail to recover the accurate background when the foreground itself is layer-level semi-transparent or transparent, since they still rely on region-based assumptions. Most importantly, current methods, such as image inpainting [69, 39, 17, 26] and layer decomposition [71, 64], cannot generalize to the real world to tackle arbitrary alpha-blended images with diverse contents and complex layer structures. In this paper, our goal is to delve into novel task that focuses on semi-transparent or transparent layer-wise decomposition. As shown in Figure 1 (a), this novel task does not require any mask-based information for background assumption and no clear visual contrast to provide depth information, and under such conditions, natural question is how to decompose these transparent or semitransparent layers from the background ? Naturally, single composited image often corresponds to multiple plausible decompositions due to the complex entanglement of color and transparency across layers, leading to additional difficulties in reconstructing the original scene. Therefore, this proposed task faced three main challenges not addressed in prior works: (1) Layer ambiguity and coupling of color and transparency: foreground and background occupy the same visual plane and lack the separability via depth or edge contrast, thereby introducing significant layer ambiguity. Furthermore, critical foreground details may be partially embedded in the alpha channel, rendering them inaccessible through RGB information alone. (2) Generalization in real-world scenarios: The above methods directly remove the pixel values of specific area and use the network to generate new pixel values based on background reasoning. Such manner largely overlooks the exploration of pixel-level correlations between the occluded area and the background, leading to the failure of generalization in various realistic scenarios. (3) Lack of large-scale dataset: significant challenge in layer decomposition is the lack of large-scale and high-quality datasets. Current datasets [53, 64] are often generated from AI, and the final overlapped images tend to have pixel-level difference from the initial foreground and back"

We open-source MiMo-VL-7B-SFT and MiMo-VL-7B-RL, two powerful vision-language models delivering state-of-the-art performance in both general visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. MiMo-VL-7B-RL outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on 35 out of 40 evaluated tasks, and scores 59.4 on OlympiadBench, surpassing models with up to 78B parameters. For GUI grounding applications, it sets a new standard with 56.1 on OSWorld-G, even outperforming specialized models such as UI-TARS. Our training combines four-stage pre-training (2.4 trillion tokens) with Mixed On-policy Reinforcement Learning (MORL) integrating diverse reward signals. We identify the importance of incorporating high-quality reasoning data with long Chain-of-Thought into pre-training stages, and the benefits of mixed RL despite challenges in simultaneous multi-domain optimization. We also contribute a comprehensive evaluation suite covering 50+ tasks to promote reproducibility and advance the field. The model checkpoints and full evaluation suite are available at https://github.com/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-VL.

Long-form text generation remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in maintaining coherence, ensuring logical consistency, and preserving text quality as sequence length increases. To address these limitations, we propose SuperWriter-Agent, an agent-based framework designed to enhance the quality and consistency of long-form text generation. SuperWriter-Agent introduces explicit structured thinking-through planning and refinement stages into the generation pipeline, guiding the model to follow a more deliberate and cognitively grounded process akin to that of a professional writer. Based on this framework, we construct a supervised fine-tuning dataset to train a 7B SuperWriter-LM. We further develop a hierarchical Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) procedure that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to propagate final quality assessments and optimize each generation step accordingly. Empirical results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SuperWriter-LM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing even larger-scale baseline models in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical DPO and underscore the value of incorporating structured thinking steps to improve the quality of long-form text generation.

While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, they encounter significant challenges with instruction-driven image editing. Our research highlights a key challenge: these models particularly struggle with structurally inconsistent edits that involve substantial layout changes. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Image Editing As Programs (IEAP), a unified image editing framework built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. At its core, IEAP approaches instructional editing through a reductionist lens, decomposing complex editing instructions into sequences of atomic operations. Each operation is implemented via a lightweight adapter sharing the same DiT backbone and is specialized for a specific type of edit. Programmed by a vision-language model (VLM)-based agent, these operations collaboratively support arbitrary and structurally inconsistent transformations. By modularizing and sequencing edits in this way, IEAP generalizes robustly across a wide range of editing tasks, from simple adjustments to substantial structural changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IEAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks across various editing scenarios. In these evaluations, our framework delivers superior accuracy and semantic fidelity, particularly for complex, multi-step instructions. Codes are available at https://github.com/YujiaHu1109/IEAP.

A review of trust, risk, and security management in LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems, examining governance, explainability, ModelOps, and privacy/security.  					AI-generated summary 				 Agentic AI systems, built on large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligent autonomy, collaboration and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural differences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that enable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is then detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and privacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique threat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI applications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms, transparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability strategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for evaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed alongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed through encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI regulations. The paper concludes with a roadmap for responsible agentic AI, proposing research directions to align emerging multi-agent systems with robust TRiSM principles for safe, accountable, and transparent deployment.

Object referring aims to detect all objects in an image that match a given natural language description. We argue that a robust object referring model should be grounded, meaning its predictions should be both explainable and faithful to the visual content. Specifically, it should satisfy two key properties: 1) Verifiable, by producing interpretable reasoning that justifies its predictions and clearly links them to visual evidence; and 2) Trustworthy, by learning to abstain when no object in the image satisfies the given expression. However, most methods treat referring as a direct bounding box prediction task, offering limited interpretability and struggling to reject expressions with no matching object. In this work, we propose Rex-Thinker, a model that formulates object referring as an explicit CoT reasoning task. Given a referring expression, we first identify all candidate object instances corresponding to the referred object category. Rex-Thinker then performs step-by-step reasoning over each candidate to assess whether it matches the given expression, before making a final prediction. To support this paradigm, we construct a large-scale CoT-style referring dataset named HumanRef-CoT by prompting GPT-4o on the HumanRef dataset. Each reasoning trace follows a structured planning, action, and summarization format, enabling the model to learn decomposed, interpretable reasoning over object candidates. We then train Rex-Thinker in two stages: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase to teach the model how to perform structured reasoning, followed by GRPO-based RL learning to improve accuracy and generalization. Experiments show that our approach outperforms standard baselines in both precision and interpretability on in-domain evaluation, while also demonstrating improved ability to reject hallucinated outputs and strong generalization in out-of-domain settings.

LLM-as-a-judge is a framework in which a large language model (LLM) automatically evaluates the output of another LLM. We propose quantitative LLM judges, which align evaluation scores of existing LLM judges to human scores in a given domain using regression models. The models are trained to improve the score of the original judge by using the judge's textual evaluation and score. We present four quantitative judges for different types of absolute and relative feedback, which showcases the generality and versatility of our framework. Our framework is more computationally efficient than supervised fine-tuning and can be more statistically efficient when human feedback is limited, which is expected in most applications of our work. We validate these claims empirically on four datasets using two base judges. Our experiments show that quantitative judges can effectively improve the predictive power of existing judges through post-hoc modeling.

"LLM-as-a-judge is a framework in which a large language model (LLM) automatically evaluates the output of another LLM. We propose quantitative LLM judges, which align evaluation scores of existing LLM judges to human scores in a given domain using regression models. The models are trained to improve the score of the original judge by using the judge's textual evaluation and score. We present four quantitative judges for different types of absolute and relative feedback, which showcases the generality and versatility of our framework. Our framework is more computationally efficient than supervised fine-tuning and can be more statistically efficient when human feedback is limited, which is expected in most applications of our work. We validate these claims empirically on four datasets using two base judges. Our experiments show that quantitative judges can effectively improve the predictive power of existing judges through post-hoc modeling."

Flowcharts are a critical tool for visualizing decision-making processes. However, their non-linear structure and complex visual-textual relationships make it challenging to interpret them using LLMs, as vision-language models frequently hallucinate nonexistent connections and decision paths when analyzing these diagrams. This leads to compromised reliability for automated flowchart processing in critical domains such as logistics, health, and engineering. We introduce the task of Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution, which traces specific components grounding a flowchart referring LLM response. Flowchart Attribution ensures the verifiability of LLM predictions and improves explainability by linking generated responses to the flowchart's structure. We propose FlowPathAgent, a neurosymbolic agent that performs fine-grained post hoc attribution through graph-based reasoning. It first segments the flowchart, then converts it into a structured symbolic graph, and then employs an agentic approach to dynamically interact with the graph, to generate attribution paths. Additionally, we present FlowExplainBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating flowchart attributions across diverse styles, domains, and question types. Experimental results show that FlowPathAgent mitigates visual hallucinations in LLM answers over flowchart QA, outperforming strong baselines by 10-14% on our proposed FlowExplainBench dataset.

A dynamic layerwise pruning method adaptively determines layer importance by combining model weights and activation information to maintain performance in large language models at high sparsity.  					AI-generated summary 				 Pruning has recently been widely adopted to reduce the parameter scale and improve the inference efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). Mainstream pruning techniques often rely on uniform layerwise pruning strategies, which can lead to severe performance degradation at high sparsity levels. Recognizing the varying contributions of different layers in LLMs, recent studies have shifted their focus toward non-uniform layerwise pruning. However, these approaches often rely on pre-defined values, which can result in suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Layerwise Pruning (DLP). This approach adaptively determines the relative importance of each layer by integrating model weights with input activation information, assigning pruning rates accordingly. Experimental results show that DLP effectively preserves model performance at high sparsity levels across multiple LLMs. Specifically, at 70% sparsity, DLP reduces the perplexity of LLaMA2-7B by 7.79 and improves the average accuracy by 2.7% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, DLP is compatible with various existing LLM compression techniques and can be seamlessly integrated into Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). We release the code at https://github.com/ironartisan/DLP to facilitate future research.

DiffDecompose, a diffusion Transformer-based framework, effectively decomposes images into constituent layers with semantic prompts, addressing challenges in transparent layer decomposition.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion models have recently motivated great success in many generation tasks like object removal. Nevertheless, existing image decomposition methods struggle to disentangle semi-transparent or transparent layer occlusions due to mask prior dependencies, static object assumptions, and the lack of datasets. In this paper, we delve into a novel task: Layer-Wise Decomposition of Alpha-Composited Images, aiming to recover constituent layers from single overlapped images under the condition of semi-transparent/transparent alpha layer non-linear occlusion. To address challenges in layer ambiguity, generalization, and data scarcity, we first introduce AlphaBlend, the first large-scale and high-quality dataset for transparent and semi-transparent layer decomposition, supporting six real-world subtasks (e.g., translucent flare removal, semi-transparent cell decomposition, glassware decomposition). Building on this dataset, we present DiffDecompose, a diffusion Transformer-based framework that learns the posterior over possible layer decompositions conditioned on the input image, semantic prompts, and blending type. Rather than regressing alpha mattes directly, DiffDecompose performs In-Context Decomposition, enabling the model to predict one or multiple layers without per-layer supervision, and introduces Layer Position Encoding Cloning to maintain pixel-level correspondence across layers. Extensive experiments on the proposed AlphaBlend dataset and public LOGO dataset verify the effectiveness of DiffDecompose. The code and dataset will be available upon paper acceptance. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/Wangzt1121/DiffDecompose.

"DiffDecompose, a diffusion Transformer-based framework, effectively decomposes images into constituent layers with semantic prompts, addressing challenges in transparent layer decomposition.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion models have recently motivated great success in many generation tasks like object removal. Nevertheless, existing image decomposition methods struggle to disentangle semi-transparent or transparent layer occlusions due to mask prior dependencies, static object assumptions, and the lack of datasets. In this paper, we delve into a novel task: Layer-Wise Decomposition of Alpha-Composited Images, aiming to recover constituent layers from single overlapped images under the condition of semi-transparent/transparent alpha layer non-linear occlusion. To address challenges in layer ambiguity, generalization, and data scarcity, we first introduce AlphaBlend, the first large-scale and high-quality dataset for transparent and semi-transparent layer decomposition, supporting six real-world subtasks (e.g., translucent flare removal, semi-transparent cell decomposition, glassware decomposition). Building on this dataset, we present DiffDecompose, a diffusion Transformer-based framework that learns the posterior over possible layer decompositions conditioned on the input image, semantic prompts, and blending type. Rather than regressing alpha mattes directly, DiffDecompose performs In-Context Decomposition, enabling the model to predict one or multiple layers without per-layer supervision, and introduces Layer Position Encoding Cloning to maintain pixel-level correspondence across layers. Extensive experiments on the proposed AlphaBlend dataset and public LOGO dataset verify the effectiveness of DiffDecompose. The code and dataset will be available upon paper acceptance. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/Wangzt1121/DiffDecompose."

A diffusion-based data augmentation strategy improves robustness in knowledge distillation by generating challenging samples, enhancing accuracy and spurious feature resilience.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large foundation models trained on extensive datasets demonstrate strong zero-shot capabilities in various domains. To replicate their success when data and model size are constrained, knowledge distillation has become an established tool for transferring knowledge from foundation models to small student networks. However, the effectiveness of distillation is critically limited by the available training data. This work addresses the common practical issue of covariate shift in knowledge distillation, where spurious features appear during training but not at test time. We ask the question: when these spurious features are unknown, yet a robust teacher is available, is it possible for a student to also become robust to them? We address this problem by introducing a novel diffusion-based data augmentation strategy that generates images by maximizing the disagreement between the teacher and the student, effectively creating challenging samples that the student struggles with. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves worst group and mean group accuracy on CelebA and SpuCo Birds as well as the spurious mAUC on spurious ImageNet under covariate shift, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion-based data augmentation baselines
