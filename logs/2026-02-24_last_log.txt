Such drift is particularly detrimental at test time, degrading model robustness and generalization. From recommendation perspective, an overlooked but fundamental property of user behavior is that interactions are inherently collaborative rather than independent. This naturally motivates guiding latent reasoning using an item interaction graph, which encodes collective patterns across users. Users with similar preferences tend to interact with similar items, and item transitions exhibit regularities shaped by population-level behaviors. These collaborative signals naturally define notion of plausibility: given users recent interactions, only subset of items is realistically relevant in the near future. Such assumptions are widely adopted in graph-based recommendation [2, 14, 35, 36, 39, 40, 43, 45], where users next interaction is expected to lie within the local neighborhood of their recent interests. In this paper, we propose ManCAR (Manifold-Constrained Adaptive Reasoning), principled framework that grounds latent reasoning within the topology of global interaction graph. Rather than naively enumerating graph traversal paths as reasoning trajectories, which is computationally expensive and unnecessary for latent reasoning, we leverage the interaction graph as feasibility constraint on the reasoning process. Specifically, we treat the neighborhood induced by the item graph as manifold constraint, restricting latent reasoning trajectories to evolve within collaboratively reachable regions while refining toward the target item. In probabilistic terms, this constraint corresponds to region on the item probability simplex where items connected to the users recent actions are assigned substantially higher probability mass than unrelated items. This feasibility view naturally admits variational interpretation of latent reasoning. Introducing latent reasoning states can be viewed as performing inference over an intermediate intent variable, with the graph-induced neighborhood serving as structure-aware prior. Latent reasoning can then be formulated using an objective similar to the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), which balances target prediction with reasoning feasibility. Besides, while the manifold constraint defines where latent reasoning can evolve, it leaves open the question of when reasoning should terminate. Since we train reasoning states to traverse collaboratively feasible regions on the item probability simplex toward the target, further refinement becomes uninformative once the item probability distribution produced by the latent state stabilizes. This motivates us to design convergence-based stopping criterion for MacCAR, allowing test-time computation to terminate adaptively when the model has sufficiently localized the target region. "

"Abstract ManCAR is a recommendation framework that constrains latent reasoning within a collaborative manifold to prevent implausible trajectories and improve accuracy.  					AI-generated summary Sequential recommendation increasingly employs latent multi-step reasoning to enhance test-time computation. Despite empirical gains, existing approaches largely drive intermediate reasoning states via target-dominant objectives without imposing explicit feasibility constraints. This results in latent drift, where reasoning trajectories deviate into implausible regions. We argue that effective recommendation reasoning should instead be viewed as navigation on a collaborative manifold rather than free-form latent refinement. To this end, we propose ManCAR (Manifold-Constrained Adaptive Reasoning), a principled framework that grounds reasoning within the topology of a global interaction graph. ManCAR constructs a local intent prior from the collaborative neighborhood of a user's recent actions, represented as a distribution over the item simplex. During training, the model progressively aligns its latent predictive distribution with this prior, forcing the reasoning trajectory to remain within the valid manifold. At test time, reasoning proceeds adaptively until the predictive distribution stabilizes, avoiding over-refinement. We provide a variational interpretation of ManCAR to theoretically validate its drift-prevention and adaptive test-time stopping mechanisms. Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that ManCAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 46.88% relative improvement w.r.t. NDCG@10. Our code is available at https://github.com/FuCongResearchSquad/ManCAR."
