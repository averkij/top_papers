[ 1 3 3 3 8 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aDespite the remarkable practical success of transformer-based language models, recent work has raised concerns about their ability to perform state tracking. In particular, growing body of literature has shown this limitation primarily through failures in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, such as length extrapolation. In this work, we shift attention to the in-distribution implications of these limitations. We conduct largescale experimental study of the data efficiency of transformers and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) across multiple supervision regimes. We find that the amount of training data required by transformers grows much more rapidly with statespace size and sequence length than for RNNs. Furthermore, we analyze the extent to which learned state-tracking mechanisms are shared across different sequence lengths. We show that transformers exhibit negligible or even detrimental weight sharing across lengths, indicating that they learn length-specific solutions in isolation. In contrast, recurrent models exhibit effective amortized learning by sharing weights across lengths, allowing data from one sequence length to improve performance on others. Together, these results demonstrate that state tracking remains fundamental challenge for transformers, even when training and evaluation distributions match. 1. Introduction State tracking is key capability of most intelligent systems and of most models of computation. It is the process of monitoring and updating the status of an entity or process with which the system interacts over period of time. State tracking is particularly important in multi-hop, interactive tasks, such as that of an agent interacting with an interface or of dialogue system interacting with user across multiple turns. State tracking has become popular area of investigation in recent years, especially in the study of LLM capabilities and failure modes. In this context, numerous studies have shown that transformer-based models are fundamentally limited in their ability to perform state tracking (for example, (Anil et al., 2022; Dziri et al., 2024)). This contrasts with recurrent networks, which excel at state tracking (although their wide-spread applicability is unfortunately hampered by their relative training inefficiency). The limitations of transformers have been demonstrated as limitations in outof-distribution (OOD) generalization, specifically lengthgeneralization: after training models on tasks encoded in sequences of given range of lengths, they were evaluated on sequences with lengths that were not seen during training. In these scenarios, the trained models fail to consistently generate correct outputs on the evaluation data, although they are able to solve the tasks for even unseen sequences in the training range of lengths. It could be argued that in any real-world use cases, OOD state tracking failures may not be an issue as long as enough training data with step-by-step sequential supervision is available. If training data covers all sequence lengths that may be encountered at inference time, inference can rely entirely on in-distribution generalization. Unfortunately, although this argument is true in principle, it is hard to quantify enough in this context. It is also hard to quantify how the amount of training data required for any given task may depend on the length of the sequences and the size of the state space. To shed light on these questions, in this work we perform detailed and systematic empirical study of the in-distribution performance of transformer-based models and contrast these with recurrent models. To this end, we train and evaluate range of representative models on range of simple state tracking tasks. Independently varying sequence length and size of the state space in these tasks then allows us to discover regularities in the dependence of generalization error on these parameters. This in turn makes it possible to obtain crude lower bound of the minimal amount of training data likely required to solve such tasks. 1Qualcomm AI Research is an initiative of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Correspondence to: Reza Ebrahimi <ebrahimi@qualcomm.com>. key difference between transformer-based and recurrent models is that, at every timestep, the former compute outputs by applying function that depends on all inputs and 1 On the Induction Bias in Sequence Models outputs generated previously (the context window), making it possible, in principle, to re-calculate the required state from the past information globally at each time step. Recurrent networks, on the other hand, compute outputs by applying function that depends on only the current hidden state, making it impossible to perform such re-calculation. This makes it strictly necessary for recurrent network to encode any relevant information from the past within single hidden state vector. This inductive bias encourages recurrent network to incorporate the information from the current timestep into its representation of state at the moment where this information is available. Conversely, it discourages it from saving this information off to determine future state updates globally from the past information. The immediate state updates thus encourage the network to process the input sequence step-by-step, making any state update explicit as soon as this is possible, rather than potentially deferring such updates to later point in time. Such step-by-step state updates are natural inductive bias (Mitchell, 1997) in the context of simple state tracking tasks, as they make it possible to reduce complex multi-step dependencies to sequence of single-step computations. They also allow model to share weights across multiple different sequence lengths, as it breaks state updates into single-step, repeatable computations. By analogy to the induction step in mathematical proof, we shall refer to this kind of inductive bias in this work as induction bias (sic). We show that the degree of knowledge transfer across multiple different sequence lengths in the indistribution setting is highly correlated with the ability of model to length-generalize. 1.1. Related work range of studies has shown that transformer-based sequence models fail to length-generalize in state tracking tasks (Anil et al., 2022; Deletang et al., 2023; Dziri et al"

Abstract Transformers require exponentially more training data than RNNs for state tracking tasks and fail to share learned mechanisms across different sequence lengths, while RNNs demonstrate effective amortized learning through weight sharing.  					AI-generated summary Despite the remarkable practical success of transformer-based language models, recent work has raised concerns about their ability to perform state tracking. In particular, a growing body of literature has shown this limitation primarily through failures in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, such as length extrapolation. In this work, we shift attention to the in-distribution implications of these limitations. We conduct a large-scale experimental study of the data efficiency of transformers and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) across multiple supervision regimes. We find that the amount of training data required by transformers grows much more rapidly with state-space size and sequence length than for RNNs. Furthermore, we analyze the extent to which learned state-tracking mechanisms are shared across different sequence lengths. We show that transformers exhibit negligible or even detrimental weight sharing across lengths, indicating that they learn length-specific solutions in isolation. In contrast, recurrent models exhibit effective amortized learning by sharing weights across lengths, allowing data from one sequence length to improve performance on others. Together, these results demonstrate that state tracking remains a fundamental challenge for transformers, even when training and evaluation distributions match.

Они показывают, что трансформеры требуют экспоненциально больше тренировочных данных по сравнению с RNN, особенно при увеличении размера пространства состояний и длины последовательности. Авторы анализируют механизмы переноса весов через разные длины последовательностей и обнаруживают, что трансформеры не делятся обученными представлениями между длинами, решая задачу для каждой длины отдельно. Напротив, рекуррентные модели эффективно используют амортизированное обучение через переиспользование весов, что позволяет им лучше обобщаться на новые длины последовательностей.",
