Text:"SkillOrchestra: Learning to Route Agents via Skill Transfer 1 , Yifei Ming 2 , Zixuan Ke 2 , Shafiq Joty 2 1 , Aws Albarghouthi , and Frederic Sala 1 1University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2Salesforce AI Research Abstract Compound AI systems promise capabilities beyond those of individual models, yet their success depends critically on effective orchestration. Existing routing approaches face two limitations: (1) input-level routers make coarse query-level decisions that ignore evolving task requirements; (2) RL-trained orchestrators are expensive to adapt and often suffer from routing collapse, repeatedly invoking one strong but costly option in multi-turn scenarios. We introduce SkillOrchestra, framework for skill-aware orchestration. Instead of directly learning routing policy end-to-end, SkillOrchestra learns fine-grained skills from execution experience and models agent-specific competence and cost under those skills. At deployment, the orchestrator infers the skill demands of the current interaction and selects agents that best satisfy them under an explicit performance-cost trade-off. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks demonstrate that SkillOrchestra outperforms SoTA RL-based orchestrators by up to 22.5% with 700 and 300 learning cost reduction compared to Router-R1 and ToolOrchestra, respectively. These results show that explicit skill modeling enables scalable, interpretable, and sample-efficient orchestration, offering principled alternative to data-intensive RL-based approaches.
