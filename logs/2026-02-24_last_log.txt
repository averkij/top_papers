Text:"TOPReward: Token Probabilities as Hidden Zero-Shot Rewards for Robotics Shirui Chen 1 2 Cole Harrison 3 Ying-Chun Lee 1 Angela Jin Yang 1 Zhongzheng Ren 1 2 4 Lillian J. Ratliff 1 Jiafei Duan 1 2 Dieter Fox 1 2 Ranjay Krishna 1 2 https://topreward.github.io/webpage/ Abstract While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have seen rapid progress in pretraining, their advancement in Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains hampered by low sample efficiency and sparse rewards in real-world settings. Developing generalizable process reward models is essential for providing the fine-grained feedback necessary to bridge this gap. However, existing temporal value functions often fail to generalize beyond their training domains. We introduce TOPReward, novel, probabilistically grounded temporal value function that leverages the latent world knowledge of pretrained video Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to estimate robotic task progress. Unlike prior methods that prompt VLMs to directly output progress valueswhich are prone to numerical misrepresentationTOPReward extracts task progress directly from the VLMs internal token logits. In zero-shot evaluations across 130+ distinct real-world tasks and multiple robot platforms (e.g., Franka, YAM, SO-100/101), TOPReward achieves 0.947 mean Value-Order Correlation (VOC) on Qwen3-VL, dramatically outperforming the state-of-the-art GVL baseline which achieves near-zero correlation on the same opensource model. We further demonstrate that TOPReward serves as versatile tool for downstream applications, including success detection and reward-aligned behavior cloning. 6 2 0 2 2 2 ] .

Introduction 6 2 0 2 3 2 ] . [ 1 5 9 8 9 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Reinforcement learning with verifiers (RLVR) is central paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet existing methods often suffer from limited exploration. Policies tend to collapse onto few reasoning patterns and prematurely stop deep exploration, while conventional entropy regularization introduces only local stochasticity and fails to induce meaningful path-level diversity, leading to weak and unstable learning signals in group-based policy optimization. We propose DSDR, Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization reinforcement learning framework that decomposes diversity in LLM reasoning into global and coupling components. Globally, DSDR promotes diversity among correct reasoning trajectories to explore distinct solution modes. Locally, it applies length-invariant, token-level entropy regularization restricted to correct trajectories, preventing entropy collapse within each mode while preserving correctness. The two scales are coupled through global-tolocal allocation mechanism that emphasizes local regularization for more distinctive correct trajectories. We provide theoretical support showing that DSDR preserves optimal correctness under bounded regularization, sustains informative learning signals in group-based optimization, and yields principled global-to-local coupling rule. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy and pass@k, highlighting the importance of dual-scale diversity for deep exploration in RLVR.

Correspondence to: Zhongwei Wan <wan.512@osu.edu>, Mi Zhang <mizhang.1@osu.edu>. Preprint. February 24, 2026. 1 Reinforcement learning with verified reward (RLVR) (Liu et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024) has recently emerged as powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Group-based policy optimization methods, such as GRPO (Guo et al., 2025), further improve training stability by exploiting relative comparisons among sampled solutions, making RLVR practical at scale. By leveraging outcome-based supervision rather than token-level imitation, RLVR has enabled substantial improvements in math and code reasoning, logical inference, and multi-step problem solving, and has become core component of recent advances in reasoning-oriented LLM training (Comanici et al., 2025; Singh et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025). Despite these successes, verified reward-maximizing RL training often exhibits limited deep exploration, even when alternative valid solution paths exist (Liu et al., 2025b; Shen, 2025; Wu et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025a). This phenomenon is widely observed across RLVR pipelines: while models improve pass@1 accuracy, they often do so by concentrating probability mass on small set of homogeneous reasoning patterns, leading to collapse in solution diversity. Consequently, pass@k performance fails to improve and generalization deteriorates, especially when models are evaluated on out-of-domain or more compositional reasoning tasks (Walder & Karkhanis, 2025; Jiang et al., 2025). natural response is to encourage diversified exploration during training, yet existing methods remain insufficient. Entropy regularization (Shen, 2025; Chen et al., 2025c; Agarwal et al., 2025), widely used in RL and RLVR, injects token-level stochasticity but mainly induces local randomness and fails to promote distinct reasoning paths. Conversely, recent diversity-driven methods (Zhang et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025b; Li et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025) encourage variation among generated solutions, sometimes with quality or correctness constraints. However, these approaches are typically single-scale or weakly coupled across scales: token-level entropy or uncertainty control induces local stochasticity and rarely sustains distinct reasoning trajectories, while trajectory-level diversity alone fails to prevent intra-mode entropy collapse once few correct templates dominate. Consequently, policies may still prematurely conDSDR: Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization for Exploration in LLM Reasoning Figure 1. (Left): global-to-local coupling for enhanced exploration during RL training. (Right): baseline exploration collapses to local suboptimal solutions, while DSDR promotes diverse trajectories that escape local optima and reach the correct solution space. centrate on small set of correct reasoning modes, and in group-normalized RLVR this concentration weakens withingroup preference signals as verifier rewards become nearly constant. The core tension between deep exploration and correctness therefore remains unresolved, requiring exploration to be correctness-aligned and explicitly coordinated across both trajectoryand token-scales. This motivates dual-scale formulation of exploration for LLM reasoning. (i) At the global level, exploration requires discovering and maintaining multiple distinct reasoning modes, corresponding to different solution paths. (ii) At the local level, exploration requires preventing premature entropy collapse (Cui et al., 2025; Shen, 2025) within each mode, so that correct trajectories remain robust and expressive rather than brittle or over-confident. Crucially, these two forms of diversity are complementary and can be jointly optimized rather than treated in isolation, since not all correct modes are equally valuable for further exploration, motivating mechanism that allocates local regularization based on global distinctiveness. Building on this insight, we propose DSDR, Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization framework for RL-based LLM reasoning. DSDR integrates global diversity regularization over correct reasoning trajectories with length-invariant, token-level entropy term applied exclusively to correct solutions. As illustrated in Figure 1, these two scales are coupled through global-to-local allocation mechanism, which prioritizes local regularization for more distinctive correct trajectories.

Gonzalez, Ion Stoica UC Berkeley Optimizing GPU kernels is critical for efficient modern machine learning systems yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of design factors and rapid hardware evolution. Existing automated approaches typically treat Large Language Models (LLMs) merely as stochastic code generators within heuristic-guided evolutionary loops. These methods often struggle with complex kernels requiring coordinated, multi-step structural transformations, as they lack explicit planning capabilities and frequently discard promising strategies due to inefficient or incorrect intermediate implementations. To address this, we propose Search via Co-Evolving World Model and build K-Search based on this method. By replacing static search heuristics with co-evolving world model, our framework leverages LLMs prior domain knowledge to guide the search, actively exploring the optimization space. This approach explicitly decouples high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling the system to navigate non-monotonic optimization paths while remaining resilient to temporary implementation defects. We evaluate K-Search on diverse, complex kernels from FlashInfer, including GQA, MLA, and MoE kernels. Our results show that K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary search methods, achieving an average 2.10 improvement and up to 14.3 gain on complex MoE kernels. On the GPUMode TriMul task, K-Search achieves state-of-the-art performance on H100, reaching 1030 µs and surpassing both prior evolution and human-designed solutions.

Maddix2, Abdul Fatir Ansari2, Akash Chandrayan3, Abhinav Pradhan3, Bernie Wang2, Matthew Reimherr1,3 1The Pennsylvania State University 2AWS AI Labs 3Amazon RME Project Page Abstract Time-series diagnostic reasoning is essential for many applications, yet existing solutions face persistent gap: general reasoning large language models (GRLMs) possess strong reasoning skills but lack the domain-specific knowledge to understand complex time-series patterns. Conversely, fine-tuned time-series LLMs (TSLMs) understand these patterns but lack the capacity to generalize reasoning for more complicated questions. To bridge this gap, we propose hybrid knowledgeinjection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLMs reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations. Across SenTSR-Bench and other public datasets, our method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%22.4%, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights. Diagnostic reasoning over time-series data is fundamental capability in many domains, enabling critical tasks such as event characterization, root-cause diagnosis, and decision-making (Leite et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a).

Abstract TOPReward is a probabilistically grounded temporal value function that uses pretrained video Vision-Language Models to estimate robotic task progress through internal token logits, achieving superior performance in zero-shot evaluations across diverse real-world tasks.  					AI-generated summary While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have seen rapid progress in pretraining, their advancement in Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains hampered by low sample efficiency and sparse rewards in real-world settings. Developing generalizable process reward models is essential for providing the fine-grained feedback necessary to bridge this gap, yet existing temporal value functions often fail to generalize beyond their training domains. We introduce TOPReward, a novel, probabilistically grounded temporal value function that leverages the latent world knowledge of pretrained video Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to estimate robotic task progress. Unlike prior methods that prompt VLMs to directly output progress values, which are prone to numerical misrepresentation, TOPReward extracts task progress directly from the VLM's internal token logits. In zero-shot evaluations across 130+ distinct real-world tasks and multiple robot platforms (e.g., Franka, YAM, SO-100/101), TOPReward achieves 0.947 mean Value-Order Correlation (VOC) on Qwen3-VL, dramatically outperforming the state-of-the-art GVL baseline which achieves near-zero correlation on the same open-source model. We further demonstrate that TOPReward serves as a versatile tool for downstream applications, including success detection and reward-aligned behavior cloning.

Abstract A compact vision-language-diffusion model called Mobile-O enables efficient unified multimodal understanding and generation on mobile devices through specialized architecture design and optimized training methodology.  					AI-generated summary Unified multimodal models can both understand and generate visual content within a single architecture. Existing models, however, remain data-hungry and too heavy for deployment on edge devices. We present Mobile-O, a compact vision-language-diffusion model that brings unified multimodal intelligence to a mobile device. Its core module, the Mobile Conditioning Projector (MCP), fuses vision-language features with a diffusion generator using depthwise-separable convolutions and layerwise alignment. This design enables efficient cross-modal conditioning with minimal computational cost. Trained on only a few million samples and post-trained in a novel quadruplet format (generation prompt, image, question, answer), Mobile-O jointly enhances both visual understanding and generation capabilities. Despite its efficiency, Mobile-O attains competitive or superior performance compared to other unified models, achieving 74% on GenEval and outperforming Show-O and JanusFlow by 5% and 11%, while running 6x and 11x faster, respectively. For visual understanding, Mobile-O surpasses them by 15.3% and 5.1% averaged across seven benchmarks. Running in only ~3s per 512x512 image on an iPhone, Mobile-O establishes the first practical framework for real-time unified multimodal understanding and generation on edge devices. We hope Mobile-O will ease future research in real-time unified multimodal intelligence running entirely on-device with no cloud dependency. Our code, models, datasets, and mobile application are publicly available at https://amshaker.github.io/Mobile-O/

Focusing on failures emerging from the integration of language models with autonomy, tool use, and multi-party communication, we document eleven representative case studies. Observed behaviors include unauthorized compliance with non-owners, disclosure of sensitive information, execution of destructive system-level actions, denial-of-service conditions, uncontrolled resource consumption, identity spoofing vulnerabilities, cross-agent propagation of unsafe practices, and partial system takeover. In several cases, agents reported task completion while the underlying system state contradicted those reports. We also report on some of the failed attempts. Our findings establish the existence of security-, privacy-, and governance-relevant vulnerabilities in realistic deployment settings. These behaviors raise unresolved questions regarding accountability, delegated authority, and responsibility for downstream harms, and warrant urgent attention from legal scholars, policymakers, and researchers across disciplines. This report serves as an initial empirical contribution to that broader conversation.

Abstract DSDR is a reinforcement learning framework that enhances large language model reasoning by promoting diversity at both global and local levels through dual-scale regularization techniques.  					AI-generated summary Reinforcement learning with verifiers (RLVR) is a central paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet existing methods often suffer from limited exploration. Policies tend to collapse onto a few reasoning patterns and prematurely stop deep exploration, while conventional entropy regularization introduces only local stochasticity and fails to induce meaningful path-level diversity, leading to weak and unstable learning signals in group-based policy optimization. We propose DSDR, a Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization reinforcement learning framework that decomposes diversity in LLM reasoning into global and coupling components. Globally, DSDR promotes diversity among correct reasoning trajectories to explore distinct solution modes. Locally, it applies a length-invariant, token-level entropy regularization restricted to correct trajectories, preventing entropy collapse within each mode while preserving correctness. The two scales are coupled through a global-to-local allocation mechanism that emphasizes local regularization for more distinctive correct trajectories. We provide theoretical support showing that DSDR preserves optimal correctness under bounded regularization, sustains informative learning signals in group-based optimization, and yields a principled global-to-local coupling rule. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy and pass@k, highlighting the importance of dual-scale diversity for deep exploration in RLVR.

Abstract A large-scale video reasoning dataset and benchmark are introduced to study video intelligence capabilities beyond visual quality, enabling systematic analysis of spatiotemporal reasoning and generalization across diverse tasks.  					AI-generated summary Rapid progress in video models has largely focused on visual quality, leaving their reasoning capabilities underexplored. Video reasoning grounds intelligence in spatiotemporally consistent visual environments that go beyond what text can naturally capture, enabling intuitive reasoning over spatiotemporal structure such as continuity, interaction, and causality. However, systematically studying video reasoning and its scaling behavior is hindered by the lack of large-scale training data. To address this gap, we introduce the Very Big Video Reasoning (VBVR) Dataset, an unprecedentedly large-scale resource spanning 200 curated reasoning tasks following a principled taxonomy and over one million video clips, approximately three orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets. We further present VBVR-Bench, a verifiable evaluation framework that moves beyond model-based judging by incorporating rule-based, human-aligned scorers, enabling reproducible and interpretable diagnosis of video reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the VBVR suite, we conduct one of the first large-scale scaling studies of video reasoning and observe early signs of emergent generalization to unseen reasoning tasks. Together, VBVR lays a foundation for the next stage of research in generalizable video reasoning. The data, benchmark toolkit, and models are publicly available at https://video-reason.com/ .

Abstract K-Search uses a co-evolving world model to optimize GPU kernels by separating high-level planning from low-level implementation, achieving significant performance improvements over existing evolutionary methods.  					AI-generated summary Optimizing GPU kernels is critical for efficient modern machine learning systems yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of design factors and rapid hardware evolution. Existing automated approaches typically treat Large Language Models (LLMs) merely as stochastic code generators within heuristic-guided evolutionary loops. These methods often struggle with complex kernels requiring coordinated, multi-step structural transformations, as they lack explicit planning capabilities and frequently discard promising strategies due to inefficient or incorrect intermediate implementations. To address this, we propose Search via Co-Evolving World Model and build K-Search based on this method. By replacing static search heuristics with a co-evolving world model, our framework leverages LLMs' prior domain knowledge to guide the search, actively exploring the optimization space. This approach explicitly decouples high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling the system to navigate non-monotonic optimization paths while remaining resilient to temporary implementation defects. We evaluate K-Search on diverse, complex kernels from FlashInfer, including GQA, MLA, and MoE kernels. Our results show that K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary search methods, achieving an average 2.10x improvement and up to a 14.3x gain on complex MoE kernels. On the GPUMode TriMul task, K-Search achieves state-of-the-art performance on H100, reaching 1030us and surpassing both prior evolution and human-designed solutions.

Abstract A novel 3D reconstruction model called tttLRM uses a Test-Time Training layer to enable efficient, scalable autoregressive reconstruction with linear complexity, achieving better results than existing methods.  					AI-generated summary We propose tttLRM, a novel large 3D reconstruction model that leverages a Test-Time Training (TTT) layer to enable long-context, autoregressive 3D reconstruction with linear computational complexity, further scaling the model's capability. Our framework efficiently compresses multiple image observations into the fast weights of the TTT layer, forming an implicit 3D representation in the latent space that can be decoded into various explicit formats, such as Gaussian Splats (GS) for downstream applications. The online learning variant of our model supports progressive 3D reconstruction and refinement from streaming observations. We demonstrate that pretraining on novel view synthesis tasks effectively transfers to explicit 3D modeling, resulting in improved reconstruction quality and faster convergence. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in feedforward 3D Gaussian reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art approaches on both objects and scenes.

Abstract A hybrid knowledge-injection framework combines general reasoning large language models with time-series LLMs through reinforcement learning-based verifiable rewards to enhance time-series diagnostic reasoning performance.  					AI-generated summary Time-series diagnostic reasoning is essential for many applications, yet existing solutions face a persistent gap: general reasoning large language models (GRLMs) possess strong reasoning skills but lack the domain-specific knowledge to understand complex time-series patterns. Conversely, fine-tuned time-series LLMs (TSLMs) understand these patterns but lack the capacity to generalize reasoning for more complicated questions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLM's reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, a multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations. Across SenTSR-Bench and other public datasets, our method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%-26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%-22.4%, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights.

"Abstract A hybrid knowledge-injection framework combines general reasoning large language models with time-series LLMs through reinforcement learning-based verifiable rewards to enhance time-series diagnostic reasoning performance.  					AI-generated summary Time-series diagnostic reasoning is essential for many applications, yet existing solutions face a persistent gap: general reasoning large language models (GRLMs) possess strong reasoning skills but lack the domain-specific knowledge to understand complex time-series patterns. Conversely, fine-tuned time-series LLMs (TSLMs) understand these patterns but lack the capacity to generalize reasoning for more complicated questions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLM's reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, a multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations. Across SenTSR-Bench and other public datasets, our method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%-26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%-22.4%, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights."
