Text:"VLANeXt: Recipes for Building Strong VLA Models Xiao-Ming Wu 1 Bin Fan 2 Kang Liao 1 Jian-jian Jiang 2 Runze Yang 3 Yihang Luo 1 Zhonghua Wu 4 Wei-Shi Zheng 2 Chen Change Loy 1 5 https://dravenalg.github.io/VLANeXt/ 6 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 2 3 5 8 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract Following the rise of large foundation models, VisionLanguageAction models (VLAs) emerged, leveraging strong visual and language understanding for general-purpose policy learning. Yet, the current VLA landscape remains fragmented and exploratory. Although many groups have proposed their own VLA models, inconsistencies in training protocols and evaluation settings make it difficult to identify which design choices truly matter. To bring structure to this evolving space, we reexamine the VLA design space under unified framework and evaluation setup. Starting from simple VLA baseline similar to RT2 and OpenVLA, we systematically dissect design choices along three dimensions: foundational components, perception essentials, and action modelling perspectives. From this study, we distill 12 key findings that together form practical recipe for building strong VLA models. The outcome of this exploration is simple yet effective model, VLANeXt. VLANeXt outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on the LIBERO and LIBERO-plus benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization in real-world experiments. We will release unified, easy-to-use codebase that serves as common platform for the community to reproduce our findings, explore the design space, and build new VLA variants on top of shared foundation. 1. Introduction Recent advances in foundation models have reshaped how we think about general-purpose robot control.

Text:"SimVLA: Simple VLA Baseline for Robotic Manipulation Yuankai Luo Woping Chen Tong Liang Baiqiao Wang Zhenguo Li6 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 4 2 2 8 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aVision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as promising paradigm for generalpurpose robotic manipulation, leveraging largescale pre-training to achieve strong performance. The field has rapidly evolved with additional spatial priors and diverse architectural innovations. However, these advancements are often accompanied by varying training recipes and implementation details, which can make it challenging to disentangle the precise source of empirical gains. In this work, we introduce SimVLA, streamlined baseline designed to establish transparent reference point for VLA research. By strictly decoupling perception from controlusing standard vision-language backbone and lightweight action headand standardizing critical training dynamics, we demonstrate that minimal design can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Despite having only 0.5B parameters, SimVLA outperforms multi-billion-parameter models on standard simulation benchmarks without robot pretraining. SimVLA also reaches on-par real-robot performance compared to π0.5. Our results establish SimVLA as robust, reproducible baseline that enables clear attribution of empirical gains to future architectural innovations. 1. Introduction The field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) learning has advanced rapidly, driven by wave of architectural innovations. Recent methods have proposed increasingly sophisticated designs, ranging from mechanisms that enrich perception with temporal context, to modules that inject explicit 3D spatial awareness, to high-capacity decoders that model complex action distributions. While these contributions have pushed the boundaries of robot capabilities, they also introduce significant challenge for the research commuCorrespondence to: Zhenguo Li <zhenguol@gmail.com>, Project website: https://frontierrobo.github.io/SimVLA. Preprint. February 23, 2026. 1 Figure 1. Out-of-box real-robot task examples. We deploy SimVLA without any additional fine-tuning on our held-out scenes and evaluate it on set of multi-stage tasks that require both dexterous manipulation and semantic understanding. nity: attributing performance gains to specific components. Since architectural changes are frequently introduced alongside confounding variablessuch as varying pretraining datasets, differing backbone scales, or ad-hoc optimization schedulesit can be difficult to disentangle the impact of novel mechanism from the underlying training recipe. To facilitate clearer comparisons and accelerate progress, we introduce SimVLA, streamlined baseline designed to serve as transparent reference point for VLA research. Our goal is not to suggest that architectural complexity is unnecessary, but to establish high-performance lower bound of complexity against which future innovations can be measured. By providing clean, minimal design that achieves state-of-the-art results, we hope to help the community better quantify the true added value of sophisticated architectural components when they are introduced. SimVLA adopts modular philosophy that decouples perception from control: standard pretrained vision-language backbone produces fused representations, which are then processed by lightweight action head to predict continuous actions. This design offers critical advantage in future-proofing: as vision-language models (VLMs) evolve, SimVLA allows researchers to swap in the latest SOTA backSimVLA: Simple VLA Baseline for Robotic Manipulation Table 1.

Furthermore, we rigorously standardize the often-overlooked training dynamicssuch as data shuffling strategies, action space normalization, and optimization schedulesdemonstrating that these implementation details often outweigh architectural differences in their impact on performance. Despite its simplicity, SimVLA is both effective and highly efficient. Figure 1 illustrates SimVLAs zero-shot scene generalization capability when deployed on the Galaxea R1 Lite, additional details about the robot platform and training data are provided in Section 4.1.2. Table 1 further presents representative example in which our model outperforms multi-billion-parameter baselines while maintaining compact memory footprint. Our main contributions are: We propose SimVLA, modular VLA baseline that decouples perception from control, enabling flexible and future-proof design that can easily adapt to new visionlanguage backbones. We identify and standardize the silent drivers of VLA performancespecifically data shuffling, normalization, and optimization dynamicsproviding rigorous training recipe that enables fair cross-model comparisons. We show that this minimal design achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing larger and more complex models on simulation benchmarks while enabling efficient realrobot transfer with zero-shot scene generalization. The rest of our paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews recent VLA advances. Section 3 introduces SimVLA and our standardized training recipe. Section 4 evaluates SimVLA in simulation and on real robots with detailed ablations. We draw our conclusion in Section 5. 2. Related Work The development of VLA models has accelerated rapidly, with numerous approaches proposing diverse strategies to improve robotic control through multimodal learning. In this section, we organize recent advances along three complementary axes: (1) visual and temporal augmentation 2 methods that enrich perceptual inputs with motion cues, predictive modeling, or memory mechanisms; (2) geometric and 3D prior integration that injects explicit spatial understanding into the VLA framework; and (3) complex action representations and architectural innovations that explore more expressive decoders and efficient designs. For more comprehensive review, readers are encouraged to consult recent surveys (Xu et al., 2025; Sapkota et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025b) that offer systematic analyses of the VLA research landscape.

Abstract Vision-Language-Action models are systematically analyzed and optimized through a unified framework, resulting in the VLANeXt model that achieves superior performance on benchmark tasks and demonstrates strong real-world generalization.  					AI-generated summary Following the rise of large foundation models, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) emerged, leveraging strong visual and language understanding for general-purpose policy learning. Yet, the current VLA landscape remains fragmented and exploratory. Although many groups have proposed their own VLA models, inconsistencies in training protocols and evaluation settings make it difficult to identify which design choices truly matter. To bring structure to this evolving space, we reexamine the VLA design space under a unified framework and evaluation setup. Starting from a simple VLA baseline similar to RT-2 and OpenVLA, we systematically dissect design choices along three dimensions: foundational components, perception essentials, and action modelling perspectives. From this study, we distill 12 key findings that together form a practical recipe for building strong VLA models. The outcome of this exploration is a simple yet effective model, VLANeXt. VLANeXt outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on the LIBERO and LIBERO-plus benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization in real-world experiments. We will release a unified, easy-to-use codebase that serves as a common platform for the community to reproduce our findings, explore the design space, and build new VLA variants on top of a shared foundation.

Abstract A conditional binary segmentation framework with cycle-consistency training enables robust object correspondence across egocentric and exocentric viewpoints without ground-truth annotations.  					AI-generated summary We study the task of establishing object-level visual correspondence across different viewpoints in videos, focusing on the challenging egocentric-to-exocentric and exocentric-to-egocentric scenarios. We propose a simple yet effective framework based on conditional binary segmentation, where an object query mask is encoded into a latent representation to guide the localization of the corresponding object in a target video. To encourage robust, view-invariant representations, we introduce a cycle-consistency training objective: the predicted mask in the target view is projected back to the source view to reconstruct the original query mask. This bidirectional constraint provides a strong self-supervisory signal without requiring ground-truth annotations and enables test-time training (TTT) at inference. Experiments on the Ego-Exo4D and HANDAL-X benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization objective and TTT strategy, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract SimVLA presents a simplified baseline for Vision-Language-Action models that achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters while enabling clearer evaluation of architectural improvements.  					AI-generated summary Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for general-purpose robotic manipulation, leveraging large-scale pre-training to achieve strong performance. The field has rapidly evolved with additional spatial priors and diverse architectural innovations. However, these advancements are often accompanied by varying training recipes and implementation details, which can make it challenging to disentangle the precise source of empirical gains. In this work, we introduce SimVLA, a streamlined baseline designed to establish a transparent reference point for VLA research. By strictly decoupling perception from control, using a standard vision-language backbone and a lightweight action head, and standardizing critical training dynamics, we demonstrate that a minimal design can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Despite having only 0.5B parameters, SimVLA outperforms multi-billion-parameter models on standard simulation benchmarks without robot pretraining. SimVLA also reaches on-par real-robot performance compared to pi0.5. Our results establish SimVLA as a robust, reproducible baseline that enables clear attribution of empirical gains to future architectural innovations. Website: https://frontierrobo.github.io/SimVLA

"Abstract SimVLA presents a simplified baseline for Vision-Language-Action models that achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters while enabling clearer evaluation of architectural improvements.  					AI-generated summary Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for general-purpose robotic manipulation, leveraging large-scale pre-training to achieve strong performance. The field has rapidly evolved with additional spatial priors and diverse architectural innovations. However, these advancements are often accompanied by varying training recipes and implementation details, which can make it challenging to disentangle the precise source of empirical gains. In this work, we introduce SimVLA, a streamlined baseline designed to establish a transparent reference point for VLA research. By strictly decoupling perception from control, using a standard vision-language backbone and a lightweight action head, and standardizing critical training dynamics, we demonstrate that a minimal design can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Despite having only 0.5B parameters, SimVLA outperforms multi-billion-parameter models on standard simulation benchmarks without robot pretraining. SimVLA also reaches on-par real-robot performance compared to pi0.5. Our results establish SimVLA as a robust, reproducible baseline that enables clear attribution of empirical gains to future architectural innovations. Website: https://frontierrobo.github.io/SimVLA"
