Text:"6 2 0 2 1 2 ] . [ 1 9 5 0 5 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r The Responsibility Vacuum: Organizational Failure in Scaled Agent SystemsModern CI/CD pipelines integrating agent-generated code exhibit structural failure in responsibility attribution. Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis. We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not process deviation or technical defect, but structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity. We identify scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime. We further characterize CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense [1] and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum. We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batchor systemlevel ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments. 1. Introduction Modern software deployments increasingly rely on agent-generated code integrated through standard CI/CD pipelines. In typical workflow, autonomous agents generate changes, automated checks validate selected properties, and human reviewers provide formal approval before deployment. This pattern is widely adopted because it preserves familiar governance structures while enabling higher development throughput. At low decision volumes, this model functions as intended. Human reviewers examine changes directly, engage with primary artifacts, and their approvals reflect substantive understanding. As deployment volume increases, however, the same approval mechanism is applied under conditions where meaningful verification can no longer be sustained. This paper analyzes what occurs when decision generation throughput systematically exceeds human verification capacity. 1.1 The Organizational Problem We observe recurring failure mode in scaled agent deployments: Formal authority persists while epistemic capacity does not. Human reviewers retain decision authority: their approval is required, their identity is recorded, and organizational processes recognize them as decisionmakers. At the same time, the conditions required for meaningful understanding time, attention, and access to primary artifacts are no longer available at scale. Decisions continue to be made, but no entity simultaneously possesses authority and capacity. We refer to this condition as responsibility vacuum: state in which decisions occur, yet responsibility cannot be meaningfully attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. The decision is formally approved, but not substantively owned. The term responsibility vacuum has previously been used in empirical studies of AI deployment in healthcare to describe fragmented responsibility attribution in practice [2]. In this work, we provide structural and organizational characterization of this phenomenon under scaling conditions. This failure mode is distinct from: Process failure, as prescribed procedures are followed correctly; Technical defects, as the underlying systems function as designed; Human error, as no individual deviation is required. Responsibility vacuum is not an exception to correct operation in such systems. It is the outcome that correct operation produces under scaling when decision authority remains individualized while verification capacity is bounded.At the core of the problem lies mismatch between the rate at which decisions are produced and the rate at which they can be meaningfully verified. Let 𝐺 denote the rate at which decisions requiring approval are generated, and let 𝐻 denote the rate at which human actor can meaningfully verify such decisions. When 𝐺 𝐻, reviewers can engage directly with decisions, verification remains substantive, and responsibility can be attributed. As 𝐺 exceeds 𝐻, the time and attention available per decision shrink, and verification degrades. When 𝐺 𝐻, verification ceases to function as decision criterion: approval persists as formal requirement, increasingly grounded in proxy signals rather than understanding. This gap does not arise from poor practices or individual failure. It reflects basic asymmetry: human verification operates under bounded time, attention, and cognitive bandwidth, whereas agent-driven decision generation scales through parallelism and task decomposition. Once this asymmetry becomes large enough, the character of review changes qualitatively, setting the stage for the failure modes analyzed in the sections that follow. 1.3 Contributions This paper makes the following contributions: 1. We characterize responsibility vacuum as an authoritycapacity mismatch and show that it is structural property of scaled deployments, not process deviation or component failure. 2. We identify scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, demonstrating that personalized responsibility cannot be preserved once decision throughput exceeds human verification capacity. 3. We describe CI amplification dynamic, explaining why additional automated validation increases approval throughput while further disconnecting approval from understanding. 4. We outline deployment implications, arguing that explicit boundary redesign is required to make responsibility allocation visible and governable. 1.4 Scope This work presents an organizational analysis rather than technical audit. We do not claim that agent systems are poorly engineered, that CI/CD pipelines are flawed, or that automation should be reduced. We do not argue "

MMDeepResearch-Bench evaluates multimodal research agents on report generation with visual evidence, revealing trade-offs between prose quality, citation accuracy, and visual grounding.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep Research Agents (DRAs) generate citation-rich reports via multi-step search and synthesis, yet existing benchmarks mainly target text-only settings or short-form multimodal QA, missing end-to-end multimodal evidence use. We introduce MMDeepResearch-Bench (MMDR-Bench), a benchmark of 140 expert-crafted tasks across 21 domains, where each task provides an image-text bundle to evaluate multimodal understanding and citation-grounded report generation. Compared to prior setups, MMDR-Bench emphasizes report-style synthesis with explicit evidence use, where models must connect visual artifacts to sourced claims and maintain consistency across narrative, citations, and visual references. We further propose a unified, interpretable evaluation pipeline: Formula-LLM Adaptive Evaluation (FLAE) for report quality, Trustworthy Retrieval-Aligned Citation Evaluation (TRACE) for citation-grounded evidence alignment, and Multimodal Support-Aligned Integrity Check (MOSAIC) for text-visual integrity, each producing fine-grained signals that support error diagnosis beyond a single overall score. Experiments across 25 state-of-the-art models reveal systematic trade-offs between generation quality, citation discipline, and multimodal grounding, highlighting that strong prose alone does not guarantee faithful evidence use and that multimodal integrity remains a key bottleneck for deep research agents.

"MMDeepResearch-Bench evaluates multimodal research agents on report generation with visual evidence, revealing trade-offs between prose quality, citation accuracy, and visual grounding.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep Research Agents (DRAs) generate citation-rich reports via multi-step search and synthesis, yet existing benchmarks mainly target text-only settings or short-form multimodal QA, missing end-to-end multimodal evidence use. We introduce MMDeepResearch-Bench (MMDR-Bench), a benchmark of 140 expert-crafted tasks across 21 domains, where each task provides an image-text bundle to evaluate multimodal understanding and citation-grounded report generation. Compared to prior setups, MMDR-Bench emphasizes report-style synthesis with explicit evidence use, where models must connect visual artifacts to sourced claims and maintain consistency across narrative, citations, and visual references. We further propose a unified, interpretable evaluation pipeline: Formula-LLM Adaptive Evaluation (FLAE) for report quality, Trustworthy Retrieval-Aligned Citation Evaluation (TRACE) for citation-grounded evidence alignment, and Multimodal Support-Aligned Integrity Check (MOSAIC) for text-visual integrity, each producing fine-grained signals that support error diagnosis beyond a single overall score.

FinVault presents the first execution-grounded security benchmark for financial agents, revealing significant vulnerabilities in current defense mechanisms when applied to real-world financial workflows.  					AI-generated summary 				 Financial agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for investment analysis, risk assessment, and automated decision-making, where their abilities to plan, invoke tools, and manipulate mutable state introduce new security risks in high-stakes and highly regulated financial environments. However, existing safety evaluations largely focus on language-model-level content compliance or abstract agent settings, failing to capture execution-grounded risks arising from real operational workflows and state-changing actions. To bridge this gap, we propose FinVault, the first execution-grounded security benchmark for financial agents, comprising 31 regulatory case-driven sandbox scenarios with state-writable databases and explicit compliance constraints, together with 107 real-world vulnerabilities and 963 test cases that systematically cover prompt injection, jailbreaking, financially adapted attacks, as well as benign inputs for false-positive evaluation. Experimental results reveal that existing defense mechanisms remain ineffective in realistic financial agent settings, with average attack success rates (ASR) still reaching up to 50.0\% on state-of-the-art models and remaining non-negligible even for the most robust systems (ASR 6.7\%), highlighting the limited transferability of current safety designs and the need for stronger financial-specific defenses.

Modern CI/CD pipelines integrating agent-generated code exhibit a structural failure in responsibility attribution. Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis.   We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.   We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.   We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.   We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments.

**Reasoning:**

- **ALIGNMENT**: The paper addresses a critical issue in deploying AI agents within CI/CD pipelines - the misalignment between formal approval processes and actual human understanding/control. This relates to ensuring AI systems behave in accordance with human values and intended oversight, which is central to alignment concerns.

- **SECURITY**: The paper discusses a structural failure mode in agent deployments where responsibility cannot be properly attributed and verification becomes ritualized rather than meaningful. This represents a security and governance vulnerability in automated decision-making systems.
