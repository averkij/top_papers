While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities in closed-world settings, exemplified by standard benchmarks in mathematics and code, they struggle in open-ended and dynamic environments. The emergence of agentic reasoning marks paradigm shift, bridging thought and action by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we provide systematic roadmap by organizing agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning establishes core single-agent capabilities, including planning, tool use, and search, that operate in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning examines how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation in evolving settings; and collective multi-agent reasoning extends intelligence to collaborative scenarios where multiple agents coordinate roles, share knowledge, and pursue shared goals. Across all layers, we analyze system constraints and optimization settings by distinguishing in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration and adaptive workflow design, from posttraining reasoning, which optimizes behaviors through reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract This work advances autonomous robot exploration by integrating agent-level semantic reasoning with fast local control. We introduce FARE, hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that integrates large language model (LLM) for global reasoning with reinforcement learning (RL) policy for local decision making. FARE follows fast-slow thinking paradigm. The slow-thinking LLM module interprets concise textual description of the unknown environment and synthesizes an agent-level exploration strategy, which is then grounded into sequence of global waypoints through topological graph. To further improve reasoning efficiency, this module employs modularity-based pruning mechanism that reduces redundant graph structures. The fast-thinking RL module executes exploration by reacting to local observations while being guided by the LLM-generated global waypoints. The RL policy is additionally shaped by reward term that encourages adherence to the global waypoints, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop behavior. This architecture decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision, allowing each module to operate in its appropriate temporal and spatial scale. In challenging simulated environments, our results show that FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines.

Text:"RoboBrain 2.5: Depth in Sight, Time in Mind.Please see Contributions and Author List for more author details.We introduce RoboBrain 2.5, next-generation embodied AI foundation model that advances general perception, spatial reasoning, and temporal modeling through extensive training on high-quality spatiotemporal supervision. Building upon its predecessor, RoboBrain 2.5 introduces two major capability upgrades. Specifically, it unlocks Precise 3D Spatial Reasoning by shifting from 2D pixel-relative grounding to depth-aware coordinate prediction and absolute metric constraint comprehension, generating complete 3D manipulation traces as ordered keypoint sequences under physical constraints. Complementing this spatial precision, the model establishes Dense Temporal Value Estimation that provides dense, step-aware progress prediction and execution state understanding across varying viewpoints, producing stable feedback signals for downstream learning. Together, these upgrades extend the framework toward more physically grounded and execution-aware embodied intelligence for complex, fine-grained manipulation.

However, critical gap persists. While these models often succeed in curated demonstrations, they frequently falter during rigorous real-world deployments. This reliability issue stems from the challenge of translating high-level semantic reasoning into physically grounded manipulation. Real-world tasks are unforgiving. They demand that robots respect absolute metric constraints, operate robustly under occlusions and viewpoint shifts, and continuously self-correct in closed loop. Unfortunately, these precise physical capabilities remain beyond the reach of current semantic planners. These requirements expose two fundamental limitations in current generalist models. First, on the spatial dimension, models suffer from metric blindness. Grounding is typically restricted to 2D pixel coordinates or weak topological representations [9, 13, 85]. Lacking absolute depth and scale information, such outputs inherently fail to ensure physical compliance. Specifically, they cannot guarantee millimeter-level clearance or generate collision-free 3D trajectories which are critical for precise interaction. Second, on the temporal dimension, models usually operate as open-loop predictors. They treat action generation as static sequence prediction task without an intrinsic mechanism to monitor execution progress. Relying on sparse external supervision such as success labels [2, 53], the agent remains oblivious to intermediate failure"

Agentic reasoning redefines large language models as autonomous agents capable of planning, acting, and learning through continuous interaction in dynamic environments across single-agent and multi-agent frameworks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process underlying inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities in closed-world settings, they struggle in open-ended and dynamic environments. Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment.

RebuttalAgent is a multi-agent framework that reframes rebuttal generation as an evidence-centric planning task, improving coverage, faithfulness, and strategic coherence in academic peer review.  					AI-generated summary 				 Writing effective rebuttals is a high-stakes task that demands more than linguistic fluency, as it requires precise alignment between reviewer intent and manuscript details. Current solutions typically treat this as a direct-to-text generation problem, suffering from hallucination, overlooked critiques, and a lack of verifiable grounding. To address these limitations, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first multi-agents framework that reframes rebuttal generation as an evidence-centric planning task. Our system decomposes complex feedback into atomic concerns and dynamically constructs hybrid contexts by synthesizing compressed summaries with high-fidelity text while integrating an autonomous and on-demand external search module to resolve concerns requiring outside literature. By generating an inspectable response plan before drafting, RebuttalAgent ensures that every argument is explicitly anchored in internal or external evidence. We validate our approach on the proposed RebuttalBench and demonstrate that our pipeline outperforms strong baselines in coverage, faithfulness, and strategic coherence, offering a transparent and controllable assistant for the peer review process. Code will be released.

Render-of-Thought framework converts textual reasoning steps into images using vision-language models to improve reasoning traceability and efficiency while maintaining competitive performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in unlocking the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although CoT prompting enhances reasoning, its verbosity imposes substantial computational overhead. Recent works often focus exclusively on outcome alignment and lack supervision on the intermediate reasoning process. These deficiencies obscure the analyzability of the latent reasoning chain. To address these challenges, we introduce Render-of-Thought (RoT), the first framework to reify the reasoning chain by rendering textual steps into images, making the latent rationale explicit and traceable. Specifically, we leverage the vision encoders of existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) as semantic anchors to align the vision embeddings with the textual space. This design ensures plug-and-play implementation without incurring additional pre-training overhead. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression and substantial inference acceleration compared to explicit CoT. Furthermore, it maintains competitive performance against other methods, validating the feasibility of this paradigm. Our code is available at https://github.com/TencentBAC/RoT

"Render-of-Thought framework converts textual reasoning steps into images using vision-language models to improve reasoning traceability and efficiency while maintaining competitive performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in unlocking the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

A comprehensive robotics benchmark evaluates video generation models across multiple task domains and embodiments, revealing deficiencies in physical realism and introducing a large-scale dataset to address training data shortages.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video generation models have significantly advanced embodied intelligence, unlocking new possibilities for generating diverse robot data that capture perception, reasoning, and action in the physical world. However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.

A multi-agent framework for compositional image retrieval that uses specialized agents for generation, filtering, and verification to improve semantic and visual query matching.  					AI-generated summary 				 Retrieval is being redefined by agentic AI, demanding multimodal reasoning beyond conventional similarity-based paradigms. Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) exemplifies this shift as each query combines a reference image with textual modifications, requiring compositional understanding across modalities. While embedding-based CIR methods have achieved progress, they remain narrow in perspective, capturing limited cross-modal cues and lacking semantic reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce XR, a training-free multi-agent framework that reframes retrieval as a progressively coordinated reasoning process. It orchestrates three specialized types of agents: imagination agents synthesize target representations through cross-modal generation, similarity agents perform coarse filtering via hybrid matching, and question agents verify factual consistency through targeted reasoning for fine filtering. Through progressive multi-agent coordination, XR iteratively refines retrieval to meet both semantic and visual query constraints, achieving up to a 38% gain over strong training-free and training-based baselines on FashionIQ, CIRR, and CIRCO, while ablations show each agent is essential.

Research reveals that causal attention in language models creates information bottlenecks when question-answer options follow context, leading to performance drops of over 14 percentage points compared to reversed prompt ordering.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models exhibit surprising sensitivity to the structure of the prompt, but the mechanisms underlying this sensitivity remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation on a striking case: in multiple-choice question answering, placing context before the questions and options (CQO) outperforms the reverse order (QOC) by over 14%p, consistently over a wide range of models and datasets. Through systematic architectural analysis, we identify causal attention as the core mechanism: in QOC prompts, the causal mask prevents option tokens from attending to context, creating an information bottleneck where context becomes invisible to options.

FARE is a hierarchical exploration framework that combines large language model reasoning with reinforcement learning control to enable efficient autonomous robot navigation in complex environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 This work advances autonomous robot exploration by integrating agent-level semantic reasoning with fast local control. We introduce FARE, a hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) for global reasoning with a reinforcement learning (RL) policy for local decision making. FARE follows a fast-slow thinking paradigm. The slow-thinking LLM module interprets a concise textual description of the unknown environment and synthesizes an agent-level exploration strategy, which is then grounded into a sequence of global waypoints through a topological graph. To further improve reasoning efficiency, this module employs a modularity-based pruning mechanism that reduces redundant graph structures. The fast-thinking RL module executes exploration by reacting to local observations while being guided by the LLM-generated global waypoints. The RL policy is additionally shaped by a reward term that encourages adherence to the global waypoints, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop behavior. This architecture decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision, allowing each module to operate in its appropriate temporal and spatial scale. In challenging simulated environments, our results show that FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines. We further deploy FARE on hardware and validate it in complex, large scale 200mtimes130m building environment.

This architecture decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision, allowing each module to operate in its appropriate temporal and spatial scale. In challenging simulated environments, our results show that FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines. We further deploy FARE on hardware and validate it in complex, large scale 200mtimes130m building environment."

RoboBrain 2.5 enhances embodied AI through improved 3D spatial reasoning and temporal value estimation for more precise manipulation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce RoboBrain 2.5, a next-generation embodied AI foundation model that advances general perception, spatial reasoning, and temporal modeling through extensive training on high-quality spatiotemporal supervision. Building upon its predecessor, RoboBrain 2.5 introduces two major capability upgrades. Specifically, it unlocks Precise 3D Spatial Reasoning by shifting from 2D pixel-relative grounding to depth-aware coordinate prediction and absolute metric constraint comprehension, generating complete 3D manipulation traces as ordered keypoint sequences under physical constraints. Complementing this spatial precision, the model establishes Dense Temporal Value Estimation that provides dense, step-aware progress prediction and execution state understanding across varying viewpoints, producing stable feedback signals for downstream learning. Together, these upgrades extend the framework toward more physically grounded and execution-aware embodied intelligence for complex, fine-grained manipulation. The code and checkpoints are available at project website: https://superrobobrain.github.io
