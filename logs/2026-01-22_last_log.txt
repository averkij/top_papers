Text:"Show me the evidence: Evaluating the role of evidence and natural language explanations in AI-supported fact-checking 6 2 0 2 6 1 ] . [ 1 7 8 3 1 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r Greta Warren grwa@di.ku.dk Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen Copenhagen, Denmark Irina Shklovski ias@di.ku.dk University of Copenhagen Copenhagen, Denmark Linköping University Linköping, Sweden Abstract Although much research has focused on AI explanations to support decisions in complex information-seeking tasks such as factchecking, the role of evidence is surprisingly under-researched. In our study, we systematically varied explanation type, AI prediction certainty, and correctness of AI system advice for non-expert participants, who evaluated the veracity of claims and AI system predictions. Participants were provided the option of easily inspecting the underlying evidence. We found that participants consistently relied on evidence to validate AI claims across all experimental conditions. When participants were presented with natural language explanations, evidence was used less frequently although they relied on it when these explanations seemed insufficient or flawed. Qualitative data suggests that participants attempted to infer evidence source reliability, despite source identities being deliberately omitted. Our results demonstrate that evidence is key ingredient in how people evaluate the reliability of information presented by an AI system and, in combination with natural language explanations, offers valuable support for decision-making. Further research is urgently needed to understand how evidence ought to be presented and how people engage with it in practice.

Chroma 1.0 enables real-time spoken dialogue with personalized voice cloning through discrete speech representations and interleaved text-audio token scheduling.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent end-to-end spoken dialogue systems leverage speech tokenizers and neural audio codecs to enable LLMs to operate directly on discrete speech representations. However, these models often exhibit limited speaker identity preservation, hindering personalized voice interaction. In this work, we present Chroma 1.0, the first open-source, real-time, end-to-end spoken dialogue model that achieves both low-latency interaction and high-fidelity personalized voice cloning. Chroma achieves sub-second end-to-end latency through an interleaved text-audio token schedule (1:2) that supports streaming generation, while maintaining high-quality personalized voice synthesis across multi-turn conversations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Chroma achieves a 10.96% relative improvement in speaker similarity over the human baseline, with a Real-Time Factor (RTF) of 0.43, while maintaining strong reasoning and dialogue capabilities. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/FlashLabs-AI-Corp/FlashLabs-Chroma and https://huggingface.co/FlashLabs/Chroma-4B .

GutenOCR enhances vision-language models for document understanding by enabling unified reading, detection, and grounding through prompt-based interfaces trained on diverse document types.  					AI-generated summary 				 GutenOCR is a family of grounded OCR front-ends obtained by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B. The resulting single-checkpoint vision-language models expose reading, detection, and grounding through a unified, prompt-based interface. Trained on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data, the models support full-page and localized reading with line- and paragraph-level bounding boxes and conditional ``where is x?'' queries. We introduce a grounded OCR evaluation protocol and show that GutenOCR-7B more than doubles the composite grounded OCR score of its Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone on 10.5K held-out business and scientific pages (0.40 to 0.82). On Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5, our approach substantially improves region- and line-level OCR as well as text-detection recall, but reveals trade-offs in page-level linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts.

Although much research has focused on AI explanations to support decisions in complex information-seeking tasks such as fact-checking, the role of evidence is surprisingly under-researched. In our study, we systematically varied explanation type, AI prediction certainty, and correctness of AI system advice for non-expert participants, who evaluated the veracity of claims and AI system predictions. Participants were provided the option of easily inspecting the underlying evidence. We found that participants consistently relied on evidence to validate AI claims across all experimental conditions. When participants were presented with natural language explanations, evidence was used less frequently although they relied on it when these explanations seemed insufficient or flawed. Qualitative data suggests that participants attempted to infer evidence source reliability, despite source identities being deliberately omitted. Our results demonstrate that evidence is a key ingredient in how people evaluate the reliability of information presented by an AI system and, in combination with natural language explanations, offers valuable support for decision-making. Further research is urgently needed to understand how evidence ought to be presented and how people engage with it in practice.

The paper focuses on how people evaluate and engage with evidence and explanations from AI systems in fact-checking tasks. While it touches on AI decision-support and human-AI interaction, the primary contribution relates to understanding data (evidence) presentation and curation in the context of information evaluation, which aligns most closely with the DATA topic (data processing, collection, and curation methodologies).

**Justification:**

- **INTERPRETABILITY**: The paper directly analyzes how people understand and evaluate AI model behavior through explanations and evidence. It examines "explanation type" and how participants interpret AI predictions, which falls under analyzing model behavior and explanations.

- **ETHICS**: The paper addresses fairness and responsible AI use in decision-making contexts (fact-checking), examining how non-expert users can reliably evaluate AI system advice and trustworthiness, which relates to ethical AI deployment.
