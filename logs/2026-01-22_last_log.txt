Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM) addresses the limitations of traditional merging methods for reinforcement learning-trained agents by distinguishing shared and task-specific parameters to preserve critical behaviors during model integration.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to post-training, particularly for agentic models that require specialized reasoning behaviors. In this setting, model merging offers a practical mechanism for integrating multiple RL-trained agents from different tasks into a single generalist model. However, existing merging methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and they are suboptimal to preserve task-specific capabilities on RL-trained agentic models. The root is a task-vector mismatch between RL and SFT: on-policy RL induces task vectors that are highly sparse and heterogeneous, whereas SFT-style merging implicitly assumes dense and globally comparable task vectors. When standard global averaging is applied under this mismatch, RL's non-overlapping task vectors that encode critical task-specific behaviors are reduced and parameter updates are diluted. To address this issue, we propose Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM), a distribution-aware merging framework explicitly designed for RL-trained agentic models. RAM disentangles shared and task-specific unique parameter updates, averaging shared components while selectively preserving and rescaling unique ones to counteract parameter update dilution. Experiments across multiple agent domains and model architectures demonstrate that RAM not only surpasses merging baselines, but also unlocks synergistic potential among agents to achieve performance superior to that of specialized agents in their domains.

  "desc": "В статье предложен метод Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM) для объединения нескольких агентов, обученных методом обучения с подкреплением на разных задачах, в единую обобщенную модель. Авторы показывают, что традиционные методы слияния моделей, разработанные для контролируемого обучения, неэффективны для RL-агентов, так как вектора задач в RL-обучении разреженные и гетерогенные, в отличие от плотных векторов при SFT. RAM явно разделяет общие параметры и специфичные для каждой задачи компоненты, усредняя первые и селективно сохраняя вторые для предотвращения размывания обновлений. Экспериментальные результаты демонстрируют, что RAM превосходит базовые методы слияния и позволяет достичь производительности выше, чем у специализированных агентов в их отдельных областях.",
