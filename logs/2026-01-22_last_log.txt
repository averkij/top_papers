Accurate recognition of these emotions is crucial for clinical triage, risk assessment, and timely intervention in mental health related applications. Despite recent advances showing that large language models (LLMs) can generalize well to various emotion analysis tasks, their diagnostic reliability in high-stakes and context-intensive medical settings remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Moreover, existing approaches are challenged by two major issues: emotional comorbidity, where multiple intertwined emotional states complicate prediction, and inefficient exploration of clinically relevant cues. To address these issues, we propose APOLO (Automated Prompt Optimization for Linguistic emOtion diagnosis), framework that systematically explores broader and finer-grained prompt space to enhance diagnostic efficiency and robustness. APOLO models instruction refinement as Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and introduces multi-agent collaboration mechanism comprising the PlannerTeacherCriticStudentTarget roles. This closed-loop design enables continuous optimization of prompt generation, evaluation, and evolution.

Finally, the Target agent determines whether to continue optimization or terminate the search based on performance evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that APOLO improves diagnostic accuracy and robustness across domain-specific and stratified benchmarks, providing generalizable and scalable paradigm for trustworthy LLM applications in mental healthcare. Index TermsLinguistic Emotion Diagnosis; Emotional Comorbidity; Inefficient Exploration; Automated Prompt Optimization; Multi-Agent Collaboration; Medical Language Processing; Trustworthy Artificial IntelligenceEmotion diagnosis for mental health plays an essential role in understanding mental health conditions and tracking the progression of related disorders [1]. Emotions associated with illnesses, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress, frequently appear in clinical notes, counseling conversations, and online mental-health communities [2], [3]. These texts capture patients cognitive and affective states and play vital role in clinical triage, risk assessment, and intervention decisions [4]. Traditional emotion recognition methods, often based on shallow features or lexicons, perform reasonably well on generic sentiment tasks but struggle in medical contexts due to semantic ambiguity, implicit emotional expressions, and domain variability [5], [6], [7]. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in affective and psycholinguistic reasoning, achieving strong few-shot or zero-shot performance on mental healthrelated text analysis [8], * Corresponding author: Haiping Zhu and Qika Lin.

Examples of disease-related emotion diagnosis under three prompting strategies: zero-shot, CoT, and APOLO. [9], [10]. However, in high-stakes clinical scenarios, LLM outputs are highly sensitive to the phrasing and structure of prompts. Minor variations in instruction design or reasoning path can lead to drastically different diagnostic outcomes [11]. For instance, cant sleep lately and dont want to see anyone implies both anxiety and depression, yet poorly designed prompt may capture only one. Handcrafted prompts, although guided by expert intuition, fail to systematically cover diverse semantic cues and implicit intentions, resulting in limited consistency and transferabil6 2 0 2 0 2 ] A . [ 1 1 8 4 3 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING 14(3), 2023 1732 ity [11], [12]. Automated Prompt Optimization (APO) provides principled way to overcome these limitations by systematically exploring broader and finer-grained prompt space [13]. Through iterative search and evaluation, APO enables adaptive discovery of optimal task-specific prompts [11]. Nevertheless, generic APO methods remain inadequate for emotion diagnosis, where complex high-context semantics and safety constraints prevail [14]. As shown in Figure 1, we compare three prompting strategies for disease-related emotion recognition. The zero-shot prompt identifies only one emotion, while the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt captures two, but both yield incomplete emotion diagnoses. This observation highlights that conventional prompting strategies fail to uncover the full spectrum of disease-related emotions, motivating the need for more systematic and adaptive approach to prompt optimization [15]. Such incompleteness arises from two fundamental issues: emotional comorbidity and inefficient exploration. Emotional comorbidity. Disease-related emotions often appear in intertwined and co-occurring forms, such as anxiety with depression, trauma with guilt, or anhedonia with self-blame. single utterance may convey multiple affective states that interact hierarchically or causally. Fixedtemplate prompts or single-label formulations fail to capture such dependencies [1]. For instance, the sentence feel guilty and afraid that might break down simultaneously expresses guilt and fear; without hierarchical reasoning, the model tends to detect only the dominant emotion. Existing prompt designs typically rely on flat labels or keyword cues, lacking mechanisms to model emotional co-occurrence and semantic ov"

A two-stage framework called DARC stabilizes self-play with large language models by decoupling question generation and using asymmetric self-distillation with document-augmented teachers to improve reasoning performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Self-play with large language models has emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving self-improving artificial intelligence. However, existing self-play frameworks often suffer from optimization instability, due to (i) non-stationary objectives induced by solver-dependent reward feedback for the Questioner, and (ii) bootstrapping errors from self-generated pseudo-labels used to supervise the Solver. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce DARC (Decoupled Asymmetric Reasoning Curriculum), a two-stage framework that stabilizes the self-evolution process. First, we train the Questioner to synthesize difficulty-calibrated questions, conditioned on explicit difficulty levels and external corpora. Second, we train the Solver with an asymmetric self-distillation mechanism, where a document-augmented teacher generates high-quality pseudo-labels to supervise the student Solver that lacks document access. Empirical results demonstrate that DARC is model-agnostic, yielding an average improvement of 10.9 points across nine reasoning benchmarks and three backbone models. Moreover, DARC consistently outperforms all baselines and approaches the performance of fully supervised models without relying on human annotations.The code is available at https://github.com/RUCBM/DARC.

First, we train the Questioner to synthesize difficulty-calibrated questions, conditioned on explicit difficulty levels and external corpora. Second, we train the Solver with an asymmetric self-distillation mechanism, where a document-augmented teacher generates high-quality pseudo-labels to supervise the student Solver that lacks document access. Empirical results demonstrate that DARC is model-agnostic, yielding an average improvement of 10.9 points across nine reasoning benchmarks and three backbone models.

"A two-stage framework called DARC stabilizes self-play with large language models by decoupling question generation and using asymmetric self-distillation with document-augmented teachers to improve reasoning performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Self-play with large language models has emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving self-improving artificial intelligence.

APOLO framework uses automated prompt optimization through multi-agent collaboration to improve emotion diagnosis accuracy and robustness in mental healthcare applications.  					AI-generated summary 				 Linguistic expressions of emotions such as depression, anxiety, and trauma-related states are pervasive in clinical notes, counseling dialogues, and online mental health communities, and accurate recognition of these emotions is essential for clinical triage, risk assessment, and timely intervention. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization ability in emotion analysis tasks, their diagnostic reliability in high-stakes, context-intensive medical settings remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Moreover, existing methods face two key challenges: emotional comorbidity, in which multiple intertwined emotional states complicate prediction, and inefficient exploration of clinically relevant cues. To address these challenges, we propose APOLO (Automated Prompt Optimization for Linguistic Emotion Diagnosis), a framework that systematically explores a broader and finer-grained prompt space to improve diagnostic efficiency and robustness. APOLO formulates instruction refinement as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and adopts a multi-agent collaboration mechanism involving Planner, Teacher, Critic, Student, and Target roles. Within this closed-loop framework, the Planner defines an optimization trajectory, while the Teacher-Critic-Student agents iteratively refine prompts to enhance reasoning stability and effectiveness, and the Target agent determines whether to continue optimization based on performance evaluation. Experimental results show that APOLO consistently improves diagnostic accuracy and robustness across domain-specific and stratified benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and generalizable paradigm for trustworthy LLM applications in mental healthcare.
