Benign fine-tuning of language models can cause privacy collapse, where models lose contextual privacy reasoning abilities despite maintaining high performance on standard benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 We identify a novel phenomenon in language models: benign fine-tuning of frontier models can lead to privacy collapse. We find that diverse, subtle patterns in training data can degrade contextual privacy, including optimisation for helpfulness, exposure to user information, emotional and subjective dialogue, and debugging code printing internal variables, among others. Fine-tuned models lose their ability to reason about contextual privacy norms, share information inappropriately with tools, and violate memory boundaries across contexts. Privacy collapse is a ``silent failure'' because models maintain high performance on standard safety and utility benchmarks whilst exhibiting severe privacy vulnerabilities. Our experiments show evidence of privacy collapse across six models (closed and open weight), five fine-tuning datasets (real-world and controlled data), and two task categories (agentic and memory-based). Our mechanistic analysis reveals that privacy representations are uniquely fragile to fine-tuning, compared to task-relevant features which are preserved. Our results reveal a critical gap in current safety evaluations, in particular for the deployment of specialised agents.

  "desc": "В этой работе исследователи обнаружили критическую уязвимость в языковых моделях: во время обучения с учителем (fine-tuning) модели могут потерять способность соблюдать контекстуальные нормы приватности, несмотря на сохранение высокого качества на стандартных бенчмарках. Авторы показали, что разнообразные паттерны в данных для обучения — такие как оптимизация на полезность, эмоциональный диалог и отладочный код — приводят к краху приватности и неправильному обмену информацией с инструментами. Механистический анализ выявил, что представления приватности особенно уязвимы при fine-tuning по сравнению с задачно-релевантными признаками. Результаты демонстрируют серьёзный пробел в текущих оценках безопасности, особенно при развёртывании специализированных агентов.",
