The resulting single-checkpoint visionlanguage models expose reading, detection, and grounding through unified, prompt-based interface. Trained on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data, the models support full-page and localized reading with lineand paragraph-level bounding boxes and conditional where is x? queries. We introduce grounded OCR evaluation protocol and show that GutenOCR-7B more than doubles the composite grounded OCR score of its Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone on 10.5K held-out business and scientific pages (0.400.82). On Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5, our approach substantially improves regionand line-level OCR as well as text-detection recall, but reveals trade-offs in page-level linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts. line-, Figure 1: Capability profile their of GutenOCR-3B/7B, Qwen2.5-VL backbones, and Qwen2.5-based OCR baselines on nine grounded OCR tasks spanning our in-domain suite and Fox. Each spoke shows raw score in [0, 1] (higher is better): in-domain page-, and local-reading tasks are scored as 1 CER, full and conditional detection as F1, and Fox page-, region-, line-, and color-guided OCR as 1 CER. GutenOCR substantially improves detection, fine-grained reading, and Fox region/line OCR, while trading off some page-level and colorguided performance relative to OCR-specialized baselines.1 Introduction 2 GutenOCR Overview. . . . .3 Data & Training.4 Evaluation Setup"

A multilingual medical reasoning framework using curriculum-informed reinforcement learning achieves high language consistency and logical correctness across thirteen languages including underrepresented ones.  					AI-generated summary 				 While large language models (LLMs) have shown to perform well on monolingual mathematical and commonsense reasoning, they remain unreliable for multilingual medical reasoning applications, hindering their deployment in multilingual healthcare settings. We address this by first introducing CUREMED-BENCH, a high-quality multilingual medical reasoning dataset with open-ended reasoning queries with a single verifiable answer, spanning thirteen languages, including underrepresented languages such as Amharic, Yoruba, and Swahili. Building on this dataset, we propose CURE-MED, a curriculum-informed reinforcement learning framework that integrates code-switching-aware supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization to jointly improve logical correctness and language stability. Across thirteen languages, our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines and scales effectively, achieving 85.21% language consistency and 54.35% logical correctness at 7B parameters, and 94.96% language consistency and 70.04% logical correctness at 32B parameters. These results support reliable and equitable multilingual medical reasoning in LLMs. The code and dataset are available at https://cure-med.github.io/
