Text:"TikTok* 6 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 6 5 2 4 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r aModels for image representation learning are typically designed for either recognition or generation. Various forms of contrastive learning help models learn to convert images to embeddings that are useful for classification, detection, and segmentation. On the other hand, models can be trained to reconstruct images with pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial losses in order to learn latent space that is useful for image generation. We seek to unify these two directions with first-of-its-kind model that learns representations which are simultaneously useful for recognition and generation. We train our model as hyper-network for implicit neural representation, which learns to map images to model weights for fast, accurate reconstruction. We further integrate our INR hyper-network with knowledge distillation to improve its generalization and performance. Beyond the novel training design, the model also learns an unprecedented compressed embedding space with outstanding performance for various visual tasks. The complete model competes with state-of-the-art results for image representation learning, while also enabling generative capabilities with its high-quality tiny embeddings. The code is available at this https URL. 1. Introduction Vision encoders, which learn to compute useful image and video representations, are foundational components of modern computer vision systems. Although such encoders may be able to solve many different tasks, in practice, we typically use them in specialized manner according to their strengths. Models trained with text-image contrastive learning [78] lend themselves well to tasks such as retrieval and visual question answering. Models trained with imageonly contrastive learning [16, 67] or self-distillation [11, 74] perform well for fine-grained image understanding, such as semantic segmentation. Variational autoencoders, which reconstruct pixels, enable image and video synthesis with diffusion and auto-regressive models. Some prior and con- *This work is for research purposes only and is not currently integrated into any TikTok technology. Figure 1. (Top) Unified modeling, in terms of both tasks and token dimensions. We propose implicit neural Hyper-networks for Unified Visual Representation, HUVR, with good classification, reconstruction, and segmentation (shown for ViT-B/16 on ImageNet, ImageNet, and ADE20K, respectively). We design our model to generate not only standard-sized tokens, but also Tiny Tokens (TinToks). Here, the tiny embeddings of DINOv3 are generated via principle component analysis (PCA). (Bottom) Reconstruction. We unify recognition and generative task families. current works attempt to unify these recognition-focused and generative-focused models post-hoc [25, 57, 68, 117]. These works point to very promising synergy between pretraining methods for recognition and generative models. natively unified encoders features should have good high level (image classification), mid level (semantic segmentation), low level (depth estimation), and pixel level (reconstruction) information out-of-the-box. These requirements point to hyper-networks for implicit 1 neural representation (INR) [22, 44] as natural candidate. An INR hyper-network is network that takes image inputs, and predicts neural network weights (INR) as output. These output INRs take pixel coordinates as inputs, and give pixel color channel values as outputs. INR hyper-networks are similar to traditional autoencoders in the sense that their latents have good pixel representation. However, unlike convolutional VAEs, transformer-based INR hyper-networks can easily borrow encoder design, patch sizes, and latent dimensions from state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders [27]. Furthermore, compared to other representation learning methods, INR hyper-networks perform compression along multiple axes, first by converting specific image to latents, and second by learning shared base INR to represent all possible images. We hypothesize this is helpful for learning high quality embeddings not only at the pixel-level, but also for low-, middle-, and high-level image information [34, 54, 84, 90]. Unified representation requires more than simply training model whose representations have suitable semantics for any task. In practice, tasks differ from each other not just in terms of the level of information or semantics they need, but also in terms of the amount of computational resources available to solve them. Tasks like retrieval become very difficult as the amount of data increases at scale, and reducing the embedding size introduces massive savings. Thus, we propose to unify representations not just in terms of tasks, but also by designing model that can generate both compressed and non-compressed representations. We design our Hyper-network for Unified Visual Representation (HUVR) with novel INR hyper-network design to natively unify disparate representation learning families, particularly recognition and reconstruction, in terms of both architectural design and pretraining. HUVR encodes images both in standard size representations, as well as smaller representation that we refer to as Tiny Tokens (TinToks). Figure 1 shows their superior recognition and novel reconstruction abilities. We build on the strengths of INR hyper-networks to design HUVR and its TinToks. INR hyper-networks do not natively learn good high level semantics, and the design of the latent tokens makes it difficult to recover patch-level information. We solve the gap in semantics via knowledge distillation from pretrained vision encoder. We refactor the design of the latent tokens to naturally support both mapping between input patches and patch tokens, as well as global cls token. To create the compressed representation, the TinToks, we introduce learnable feature downsampling and upsampling layers in between the transformer backbone and the layers that produce the final INR prediction. In summary, our key contributions are: We design and train an INR hyper-network, HUVR, which can match or outperform DINOv3 [87] with ViTB/16 we achieve +0.4% for ImageNet [24] classification and +1.2 mIoU for ADE20K [118] semantic segmentation, and +4.84 PSNR for reconstruction. The compressed representation TinToks, at 96x compression, can offer +48% ImageNet classification compared to DINOv3 PCA baseline, and +1.26 PSNR compared to the Stable Diffusion VAE [80] at equ"

A unified model learns image representations useful for both recognition and generation by using a hyper-network for implicit neural representation with knowledge distillation, achieving state-of-the-art results while enabling generative capabilities through compressed embeddings.  					AI-generated summary 				 Models for image representation learning are typically designed for either recognition or generation. Various forms of contrastive learning help models learn to convert images to embeddings that are useful for classification, detection, and segmentation. On the other hand, models can be trained to reconstruct images with pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial losses in order to learn a latent space that is useful for image generation. We seek to unify these two directions with a first-of-its-kind model that learns representations which are simultaneously useful for recognition and generation. We train our model as a hyper-network for implicit neural representation, which learns to map images to model weights for fast, accurate reconstruction. We further integrate our INR hyper-network with knowledge distillation to improve its generalization and performance. Beyond the novel training design, the model also learns an unprecedented compressed embedding space with outstanding performance for various visual tasks. The complete model competes with state-of-the-art results for image representation learning, while also enabling generative capabilities with its high-quality tiny embeddings.

Motion 3-to-4 synthesizes high-quality 4D dynamic objects from monocular video and 3D mesh by decomposing into static shape generation and motion reconstruction with canonical mesh and transformer-based frame processing.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Motion 3-to-4, a feed-forward framework for synthesising high-quality 4D dynamic objects from a single monocular video and an optional 3D reference mesh. While recent advances have significantly improved 2D, video, and 3D content generation, 4D synthesis remains difficult due to limited training data and the inherent ambiguity of recovering geometry and motion from a monocular viewpoint. Motion 3-to-4 addresses these challenges by decomposing 4D synthesis into static 3D shape generation and motion reconstruction. Using a canonical reference mesh, our model learns a compact motion latent representation and predicts per-frame vertex trajectories to recover complete, temporally coherent geometry. A scalable frame-wise transformer further enables robustness to varying sequence lengths. Evaluations on both standard benchmarks and a new dataset with accurate ground-truth geometry show that Motion 3-to-4 delivers superior fidelity and spatial consistency compared to prior work.
