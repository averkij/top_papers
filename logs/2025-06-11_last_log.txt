INTRODUCTION The financial industry increasingly leverages reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, giving rise to the interdisciplinary field known as Financial Reinforcement Learning (FinRL), which includes applications in portfolio management, algorithmic trading, and option pricing. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have further accelerated the growth of open finance by providing scalable, affordable, and personalized solutions such as enhanced financial search and robo-advisory services. Despite these promising developments, the application of LLMs to Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR) introduces significant challenges due to the complexity and precision required by financial regulations.

ECoRAG framework enhances LLM performance in ODQA by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, reducing latency and token usage.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or ECoRAG framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not, retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods. Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to generate the correct answer. Code is available at https://github.com/ldilab/ECoRAG.
