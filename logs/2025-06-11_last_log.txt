A novel framework called Squeeze3D uses pre-trained models to compress 3D data efficiently, achieving high compression ratios while maintaining visual quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose Squeeze3D, a novel framework that leverages implicit prior knowledge learnt by existing pre-trained 3D generative models to compress 3D data at extremely high compression ratios. Our approach bridges the latent spaces between a pre-trained encoder and a pre-trained generation model through trainable mapping networks. Any 3D model represented as a mesh, point cloud, or a radiance field is first encoded by the pre-trained encoder and then transformed (i.e. compressed) into a highly compact latent code. This latent code can effectively be used as an extremely compressed representation of the mesh or point cloud. A mapping network transforms the compressed latent code into the latent space of a powerful generative model, which is then conditioned to recreate the original 3D model (i.e. decompression). Squeeze3D is trained entirely on generated synthetic data and does not require any 3D datasets. The Squeeze3D architecture can be flexibly used with existing pre-trained 3D encoders and existing generative models. It can flexibly support different formats, including meshes, point clouds, and radiance fields. Our experiments demonstrate that Squeeze3D achieves compression ratios of up to 2187x for textured meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields while maintaining visual quality comparable to many existing methods. Squeeze3D only incurs a small compression and decompression latency since it does not involve training object-specific networks to compress an object.

Frame Guidance offers a training-free method for controlling video generation using frame-level signals, reducing memory usage and enhancing globally coherent video output.  					AI-generated summary 				 Advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video quality, directing attention to fine-grained controllability. However, many existing methods depend on fine-tuning large-scale video models for specific tasks, which becomes increasingly impractical as model sizes continue to grow. In this work, we present Frame Guidance, a training-free guidance for controllable video generation based on frame-level signals, such as keyframes, style reference images, sketches, or depth maps. For practical training-free guidance, we propose a simple latent processing method that dramatically reduces memory usage, and apply a novel latent optimization strategy designed for globally coherent video generation. Frame Guidance enables effective control across diverse tasks, including keyframe guidance, stylization, and looping, without any training, compatible with any video models. Experimental results show that Frame Guidance can produce high-quality controlled videos for a wide range of tasks and input signals.
