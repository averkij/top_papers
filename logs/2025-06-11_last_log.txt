Text:"Thinking vs. Doing: Agents that Reason by Scaling Test-Time Interaction Junhong Shen*1,2, Hao Bai*3, Lunjun Zhang4, Yifei Zhou5, Amrith Setlur1, Shengbang Tong7, Diego Caples6, Nan Jiang3, Tong Zhang3, Ameet Talwalkar1 and Aviral Kumar1 1Carnegie Mellon University, 2Scribe, 3University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 4University of Toronto, 5University of California, Berkeley, 6The AGI Company, 7New York University 5 2 0 2 0 1 ] . [ 2 6 7 9 7 0 . 6 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: We propose new-axis of test-time scaling for agents: scaling the number of interaction steps. Unlike traditional methods that emphasize longer reasoning per step, we show that acting more helps gain new information from the environment and improve task performance (detailed results of the left plot in Section 4.2). Abstract: The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning traces (thinking more) before producing response. In agent problems that require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of test-time scaling that increases the agents interaction horizon to enable running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic re-planning within single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI (Test-Time Interaction), curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths. Using Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI"

A dataset with annotations aids in fine-tuning MLLMs for accurate detection and localization of AI-generated images with meaningful explanations.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid advancement of image generation technologies intensifies the demand for interpretable and robust detection methods. Although existing approaches often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations. However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

CONFLICTS, a benchmark for evaluating how LLMs handle knowledge conflicts in RAG, reveals significant challenges in conflict resolution but shows improvement with explicit prompting.  					AI-generated summary 				 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting information and it remains unclear how models should address such discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.

MMRefine evaluates the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models through a benchmark that categorizes errors and identifies performance bottlenecks.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper introduces MMRefine, a MultiModal Refinement benchmark designed to evaluate the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference, MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/naver-ai/MMRefine.

"MMRefine evaluates the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models through a benchmark that categorizes errors and identifies performance bottlenecks.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper introduces MMRefine, a MultiModal Refinement benchmark designed to evaluate the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference, MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/naver-ai/MMRefine."

LLMs exhibit significant geopolitical biases in their interpretation of historical events, and simple debiasing methods have limited effectiveness; a novel dataset for further research is provided.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs with respect to various countries though an analysis of their interpretation of historical events with conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, and China). We introduce a novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from different countries. Our findings show significant geopolitical biases, with models favoring specific national narratives. Additionally, simple debiasing prompts had a limited effect in reducing these biases. Experiments with manipulated participant labels reveal models' sensitivity to attribution, sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies, especially with swapped labels. This work highlights national narrative biases in LLMs, challenges the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods, and offers a framework and dataset for future geopolitical bias research.

这篇文章评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在解释历史事件时的地缘政治偏见。研究涉及美国、英国、苏联和中国等国家。文章引入了一个新的数据集，包含中立的事件描述和不同国家的对立观点。研究发现，模型倾向于特定的国家叙事，简单的去偏见方法效果有限。实验还显示，模型对参与者标签的更改非常敏感，有时会放大偏见或识别不一致。
