ECoRAG framework enhances LLM performance in ODQA by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, reducing latency and token usage.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or ECoRAG framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not, retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods. Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to generate the correct answer. Code is available at https://github.com/ldilab/ECoRAG.

"RKEFino1, a knowledge-enhanced financial reasoning model, addresses accuracy and compliance challenges in Digital Regulatory Reporting through fine-tuning with domain knowledge from XBRL, CDM, and MOF, and introduces a novel Numerical NER task.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for financial applications but introduce critical accuracy and compliance challenges in Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR). To address these issues, we propose RKEFino1, a regulation knowledge-enhanced financial reasoning model built upon Fino1, fine-tuned with domain knowledge from XBRL, CDM, and MOF. We formulate two QA tasks-knowledge-based and mathematical reasoning-and introduce a novel Numerical NER task covering financial entities in both sentences and tables. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capacity of RKEFino1 in compliance-critical financial tasks. We have released our model on Hugging Face."
