Recent breakthroughs in video generation models, capable of synthesizing realistic and interactive virtual environments, present an opportunity to revolutionize game creation. In this position paper, we propose Interactive Generative Video (IGV) as the foundation for Generative Game Engines (GGE), enabling unlimited novel content generation in next-generation gaming. GGE leverages IGVs unique strengths in unlimited high-quality content synthesis, physics-aware world modeling, usercontrolled interactivity, long-term memory capabilities, and causal reasoning.

Our work charts new course for game development in the AI era, envisioning future where AI-powered generative systems fundamentally reshape how games are created and experienced. 1. Introduction Computer games have witnessed an ever-growing market demand, yet the gaming industry faces three critical challenges. First, current game engines rely heavily on pre-made assets and fixed logic scripts, leading to predetermined content that players will eventually exhaust, even in modern openworld games. Second, existing game engines cannot provide adaptive, personalized gaming content tailored to individual players preferences, habits, and backgrounds. Third, developing high-quality games, especially AAA games, requires substantial human resources and extensive development time. How to rapidly create high-quality games with unlimited personalized content while minimizing costs remains fundamental challenge for the entire gaming industry. *Equal contribution 1The University of Hong Kong 2The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 3Kuaishou Xintao Wang <xinTechnology. tao.wang@outlook.com>, Xihui Liu <xihuiliu@eee.hku.hk>. Correspondence to: During the past year, video generation models have made remarkable progress (OpenAI, 2024; Lab & etc., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b; Yang et al., 2024e), demonstrating unprecedented capabilities in large-scale motion dynamics, semantic understanding and concept composition, 3D consistency with physical laws, and long-term temporal coherence in both object structure and appearance. These advances show great potential for effectively simulating real-world physics (OpenAI, 2024; Yang et al., 2024d; 2023), suggesting that these models could serve as capable world models for generating physically plausible videos. Building upon these advances in video generation, we propose Interactive Generative Video (IGV), new paradigm that extends video generation capabilities with interactive features. IGV centers around video generation while incorporating four key characteristics: user control over the generated content, memory of video context, understanding and simulation of physical rules, and causal reasoning intelligence. By combining these elements, IGV effectively constructs an explorable and interactive virtual world through video generation, functioning similarly to simulator. The virtual worlds created by IGV naturally align with video games as they provide interactive environments where players can explore and engage with dynamically generated content, representing promising direction for next-generation gaming. Recent works (Bruce et al., 2024; DeepMind, 2024; Alonso et al., 2024; Valevski et al., 2024; Che et al., 2024; Feng et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024b; Yu et al., 2025; Decart, 2024) have demonstrated this potential by training actionconditioned video generation models using action-video pairs collected from classic games like Atari (Alonso et al., 2024), DOOM (Valevski et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024b), CS:GO (Alonso et al., 2024), Minecraft (Yu et al., 2025; Decart, 2024), and Super Mario Bros (Yang et al., 2024b). These models create interactive gaming experiences by iteratively generating predicted video frames in response to user action inputs. However, as pointed out by some works (Yu et al., 2025; Feng et al., 2024; DeepMind, 2024), merely replicating existing games through IGV offers limited value over traditional game engines. The revolutionary potential of IGV lies in its ability to create infinite entirely new games through its powerful generative capabilities. Imagine future where Position: Interactive Generative Video as Next-Generation Game Engine everyone can become game designer, creating their own games by simply providing design instructions to video generation models, which then generate limitless explorable virtual worlds. This will fundamentally transform both game development and gaming experiences. In conclusion, this position paper argues that Interactive Generative Video (IGV) serves as the core technology for Generative Game Engine (GGE). GGE will significantly reduce technical barriers in game development while boosting development productivity and creativity through infinite AI-driven content generation. In this position paper, we first introduce essential preliminary knowledge about video generation and AI-driven game applications in Sec. 2. Sec. 3 analyzes the core capabilities required for next-generation Generative Game Engines (GGE) and demonstrates why Interactive Generative Video (IGV) is uniquely positioned to fulfill these requirements. Sec. 4 presents our comprehensive framework for GGE, providing detailed definitions, analysis, and future prospects for each module within the framework. To guide future research and development, Sec. 5 proposes hierarchical roadmap that outlines progressive milestones toward fully functional GGE systems. Finally, Sec. 6 and Sec. 7 discuss alternative perspectives and provide concluding remarks. 2. Preliminaries 2.1. Video Generation Models Video Generation Models aim to synthesize temporally consistent video sequences = {x0, x1, . . . , xt}, where xi indicates the i-th frame. The video is generated by an autoregressive model (Razavi et al., 2019), diffusion model (Ho et al., 2022), or masked transformer model (Chang et al., 2022). With the rise of diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021; Song & Ermon, 2019), which have"

Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual content generation but remain challenging to deploy due to their high computational cost during inference. This computational burden primarily arises from the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to image or video resolution. While existing acceleration methods often compromise output quality or necessitate costly retraining, we observe that most diffusion models are pre-trained at lower resolutions, presenting an opportunity to exploit these low-resolution priors for more efficient inference without degrading performance. In this work, we introduce Bottleneck Sampling, a training-free framework that leverages low-resolution priors to reduce computational overhead while preserving output fidelity. Bottleneck Sampling follows a high-low-high denoising workflow: it performs high-resolution denoising in the initial and final stages while operating at lower resolutions in intermediate steps. To mitigate aliasing and blurring artifacts, we further refine the resolution transition points and adaptively shift the denoising timesteps at each stage. We evaluate Bottleneck Sampling on both image and video generation tasks, where extensive experiments demonstrate that it accelerates inference by up to 3times for image generation and 2.5times for video generation, all while maintaining output quality comparable to the standard full-resolution sampling process across multiple evaluation metrics.

Evaluating generative foundation models on open-ended multimodal understanding (MMU) and generation (MMG) tasks across diverse modalities (e.g., images, audio, video) poses significant challenges due to the complexity of cross-modal interactions. To this end, the idea of utilizing Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as automated judges has emerged, with encouraging results in assessing vision-language understanding tasks. Moving further, this paper extends MLLM-as-a-Judge across modalities to a unified manner by introducing two benchmarks, TaskAnything and JudgeAnything, to respectively evaluate the overall performance and judging capabilities of MLLMs across any-to-any modality tasks. Specifically, TaskAnything evaluates the MMU and MMG capabilities across 15 any-to-any modality categories, employing 1,500 queries curated from well-established benchmarks. Furthermore, JudgeAnything evaluates the judging capabilities of 5 advanced (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash) from the perspectives of Pair Comparison and Score Evaluation, providing a standardized testbed that incorporates human judgments and detailed rubrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that while these MLLMs show promise in assessing MMU (i.e., achieving an average of 66.55% in Pair Comparison setting and 42.79% in Score Evaluation setting), they encounter significant challenges with MMG tasks (i.e., averaging only 53.37% in Pair Comparison setting and 30.05% in Score Evaluation setting), exposing cross-modality biases and hallucination issues. To address this, we present OmniArena, an automated platform for evaluating omni-models and multimodal reward models. Our work highlights the need for fairer evaluation protocols and stronger alignment with human preferences.

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capability in solving mathematical problems. However, existing approaches primarily focus on improving the quality of correct training data, e.g., distilling high-quality correct solutions from advanced models, neglecting the value contained in error data, potentially hindering the model's reflective ability. Though some studies attempt to leverage error data, they often involve complex mechanisms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore error nodes. In this work, we propose to enhance LLMs' reasoning ability by Learning from Errors for Mathematical Advancement (LEMMA). LEMMA constructs data consisting of an incorrect solution with an erroneous step and a reflection connection to a correct solution for fine-tuning. Specifically, we systematically analyze the model-generated error types and introduce an error-type grounded mistake augmentation method to collect diverse and representative errors. Correct solutions are either from fixing the errors or generating a fresh start. Through a model-aware smooth reflection connection, the erroneous solution is transferred to the correct one. By fine-tuning on the constructed dataset, the model is able to self-correct errors autonomously within the generation process without relying on external critique models. Experimental results demonstrate that LEMMA achieves significant performance improvements over other strong baselines.

However, existing approaches primarily focus on improving the quality of correct training data, e.g., distilling high-quality correct solutions from advanced models, neglecting the value contained in error data, potentially hindering the model's reflective ability. Though some studies attempt to leverage error data, they often involve complex mechanisms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore error nodes. In this work, we propose to enhance LLMs' reasoning ability by Learning from Errors for Mathematical Advancement (LEMMA). LEMMA constructs data consisting of an incorrect solution with an erroneous step and a reflection connection to a correct solution for fine-tuning. Specifically, we systematically analyze the model-generated error types and introduce an error-type grounded mistake augmentation method to collect diverse and representative errors. Correct solutions are either from fixing the errors or generating a fresh start. Through a model-aware smooth reflection connection, the erroneous solution is transferred to the correct one. By fine-tuning on the constructed dataset, the model is able to self-correct errors autonomously within the generation process without relying on external critique models. Experimental results demonstrate that LEMMA achieves significant performance improvements over other strong baselines."

This paper presents AlphaSpace, a novel methodology designed to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for 3D Cartesian space navigation. AlphaSpace employs a semantics-based tokenization strategy, encoding height information through specialized semantic tokens, and integrates primarily symbolic synthetic reasoning data. This approach enables LLMs to accurately manipulate objects by positioning them at specific [x, y, z] coordinates. Experimental results demonstrate that AlphaSpace significantly outperforms existing models on manipulation subtasks, achieving a total accuracy of 66.67%, compared to 37.5% for GPT-4o and 29.17% for Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Text-to-video (T2V) generation has made significant strides with diffusion models. However, existing methods still struggle with accurately binding attributes, determining spatial relationships, and capturing complex action interactions between multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we propose MagicComp, a training-free method that enhances compositional T2V generation through dual-phase refinement. Specifically, (1) During the Conditioning Stage: We introduce the Semantic Anchor Disambiguation to reinforces subject-specific semantics and resolve inter-subject ambiguity by progressively injecting the directional vectors of semantic anchors into original text embedding; (2) During the Denoising Stage: We propose Dynamic Layout Fusion Attention, which integrates grounding priors and model-adaptive spatial perception to flexibly bind subjects to their spatiotemporal regions through masked attention modulation. Furthermore, MagicComp is a model-agnostic and versatile approach, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing T2V architectures. Extensive experiments on T2V-CompBench and VBench demonstrate that MagicComp outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential for applications such as complex prompt-based and trajectory-controllable video generation.
