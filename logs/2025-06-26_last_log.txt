ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o enable open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation through a large dataset and multimodal model.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in multimodal generative models have unlocked photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation, yet leading systems like GPT-4o-Image remain proprietary and inaccessible. To democratize these capabilities, we present ShareGPT-4o-Image, the first dataset comprising 45K text-to-image and 46K text-and-image-to-image data, all synthesized using GPT-4o's image generation capabilities for distilling its advanced image generation abilities. Leveraging this dataset, we develop Janus-4o, a multimodal large language model capable of both text-to-image and text-and-image-to-image generation. Janus-4o not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor, Janus-Pro, but also newly supports text-and-image-to-image generation. Notably, it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from scratch, using only 91K synthetic samples and 6 hours of training on an 8 A800-GPU machine. We hope the release of ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o will foster open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.

На основе этого датасета разработана мультимодальная языковая модель Janus-4o, способная генерировать изображения как по тексту, так и по тексту с изображением. Janus-4o значительно улучшает генерацию изображений по сравнению с предшественником Janus-Pro и достигает впечатляющих результатов в генерации изображений по тексту и изображению, используя всего 91 тысячу синтетических примеров.
