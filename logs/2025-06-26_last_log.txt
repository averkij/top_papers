A new strategy merges layers from fine-tuned model variants to compress large language models with minimal performance loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in deployment and inference. While structured pruning of model parameters offers a promising way to reduce computational costs at deployment time, current methods primarily focus on single model pruning. In this work, we develop a novel strategy to compress models by strategically combining or merging layers from finetuned model variants, which preserves the original model's abilities by aggregating capabilities accentuated in different finetunes. We pose the optimal tailoring of these LLMs as a zero-order optimization problem, adopting a search space that supports three different operations: (1) Layer removal, (2) Layer selection from different candidate models, and (3) Layer merging. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to competitive model pruning, for example, for the Llama2-13B model families, our compressed models maintain approximately 97.3\% of the original performance while removing sim25% of parameters, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/Guinan-Su/auto-merge-llm.

"A new strategy merges layers from fine-tuned model variants to compress large language models with minimal performance loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in deployment and inference. While structured pruning of model parameters offers a promising way to reduce computational costs at deployment time, current methods primarily focus on single model pruning. In this work, we develop a novel strategy to compress models by strategically combining or merging layers from finetuned model variants, which preserves the original model's abilities by aggregating capabilities accentuated in different finetunes. We pose the optimal tailoring of these LLMs as a zero-order optimization problem, adopting a search space that supports three different operations: (1) Layer removal, (2) Layer selection from different candidate models, and (3) Layer merging. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to competitive model pruning, for example, for the Llama2-13B model families, our compressed models maintain approximately 97.3\% of the original performance while removing sim25% of parameters, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/Guinan-Su/auto-merge-llm."

Sentence-level attribution methods uncover critical thought anchors in large language models' reasoning processes, enhancing interpretability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.
