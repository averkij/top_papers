Text:"Ammar Khairi1, Daniel Dsouza1, Ye Shen2, Julia Kreutzer1, and Sara Hooker1 1Cohere Labs, 2Cohere Corresponding authors: {ammar, juliakreutzer, sarahooker}@cohere.com Abstract Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted focus toward scaling inferencetime computeimproving performance without retraining the model. common approach is to sample multiple outputs in parallel, and select one of these as the final output. However, work to date has focused on English and handful of domains such as math and code. In contrast, we are most interested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally verifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly scale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in multilingual, multi-task setting. Our findings show that both sampling strategybased on temperature variationand selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and varied language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing that strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages. We propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for multilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable gains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and selection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models on m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini. At larger scale, Command-A (111B model) equipped with our methods, shows +9.0 improvement in win-rates on the same benchmark with just five samples against single-sample decoding, substantial increase at minimal cost. Our results underscore the need for languageand task-aware approaches to inference-time compute, aiming to democratize performance improvements in underrepresented languages. 5 2 0 2 J 5 2 ] .

Optimizing tokenizers for chatbot conversations reduces computational costs and energy usage with minimal impact on training corpus performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 The computational and energy costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased exponentially driven by the growing model sizes and the massive adoption of LLMs by hundreds of millions of users. The unit cost of an LLM is the computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in the efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the number of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular applications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation is that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the tokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most likely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that immediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing tokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for different tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot conversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in this domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers consistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead to meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or even slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original training corpus.
