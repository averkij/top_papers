Tsinghua University Beijing, China algazinovalexandr@gmail.com Matt Laing Dept. of Psych. & Cog. Sci. Tsinghua University Beijing, China matthieu.laing@gmail.com Paul Laban Dept. of Comp.

[ 1 2 0 5 9 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r AbstractAccessibility remains critical concern in todays society, as many technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs. Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital environments. We introduce MATE, multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs the modality conversions based on the users needs. The system is useful for assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description. MATE can be applied to wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as healthcare, and can become useful assistant for various groups of users. The system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with wide variety of hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce ModCon-Task-Identifier, model that is capable of extract"

The Debugging Decay Index (DDI) quantifies and optimizes the effectiveness of iterative AI debugging by predicting intervention points to revive and enhance debugging capability.  					AI-generated summary 				 The effectiveness of AI debugging follows a predictable exponential decay pattern; most models lose 60-80% of their debugging capability within just 2-3 attempts, despite iterative debugging being a critical capability for practical code generation systems. We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process, demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code generation strategies.
