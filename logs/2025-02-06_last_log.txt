[ 1 5 0 1 1 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Fig. 1. LayerTracer enables the creation of cognitive-aligned layered SVGs, either from text prompts or by converting images into layer-wise SVGs. Generating cognitive-aligned layered SVGs remains challenging due to existing methods tendencies toward either oversimplified single-layer outputs or optimization-induced shape redundancies. We propose LayerTracer, diffusion transformer based framework that bridges this gap by learning designers layered SVG creation processes from novel dataset of sequential design operations. Our approach operates in two phases: First, textconditioned DiT generates multi-phase rasterized construction blueprints that simulate human design workflows. Second, layer-wise vectorization with path deduplication produces clean, editable SVGs. For image vectorization, we introduce conditional diffusion mechanism that encodes reference images into latent tokens, guiding hierarchical reconstruction while preserving structural integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate LayerTracers superior performance against optimization-based and neural baselines in both generation quality and editability, effectively aligning Corresponding author.
