[ 1 1 7 6 2 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aPost-training of language models (LMs) increasingly relies on the following two stages: (i) knowledge distillation, where the LM is trained to imitate larger teacher LM, and (ii) reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where the LM is aligned by optimizing reward model. In the second RLHF stage, well-known challenge is reward hacking, where the LM over-optimizes the reward model. Such phenomenon is in line with Goodharts law and can lead to degraded performance on the true objective. In this paper, we investigate whether similar phenomenon, that we call teacher hacking, can occur during knowledge distillation. This could arise because the teacher LM is itself an imperfect approximation of the true distribution. To study this, we propose controlled experimental setup involving: (i) an oracle LM representing the ground-truth distribution, (ii) teacher LM distilled from the oracle, and (iii) student LM distilled from the teacher. Our experiments reveal the following insights. When using fixed offline dataset for distillation, teacher hacking occurs; moreover, we can detect it by observing when the optimization process deviates from polynomial convergence laws. In contrast, employing online data generation techniques effectively mitigates teacher hacking. More precisely, we identify data diversity as the key factor in preventing hacking. Overall, our findings provide deeper understanding of the benefits and limitations of distillation for building robust and efficient LMs. Ecole 1CMAP, France; Polytechnique, Work done during an internship at Google DeepMind. 2Google DeepMind. Correspondence to: Daniil Tiapkin <daniil.tiapkin@polytechnique.edu>. Palaiseau, Figure 1. Overview of our controlled experimental setup. Usually, the teacher model is trained on expert data before being distilled into the student LM. In the controlled setup of this paper, the teacher is itself distilled from an additional oracle model. This oracle model allows us to measure the quality of the distillation process into the student, and to reveal teacher hacking. 1. Introduction Distillation for post-training LMs. Language models (LMs) have achieved remarkable success across wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as translation, summarization, and reasoning. Notably, large LMs demonstrate impressive generalization capabilities, but their high computational cost poses significant challenge, particularly when deployed on resource-constrained devices. Efficiency considerations motivate the training of smaller LMs, that would ideally provide similar performance at fraction of the computational cost. To this end, the most popular approach is knowledge distillation (KD) (Hinton et al., 2015), in which smaller student LM is trained to imitate the larger teacher LM. Distillation is increasingly studied (Agarwal et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024) and used, notably for the post-training pipelines of LMs (as demonstrated by Zephyr (Tunstall et al., 2023), Gemma-2 (Riviere et al., 2024), and DeepSeek-V3 (Liu et al., 2024a)), just before the final reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022) phase. Teacher as an imperfect proxy. However, key understudied limitation of KD is that the teacher model does not represent the ground-truth distribution but instead acts as 1 On Teacher Hacking in Language Model Distillation an imperfect proxy for it (Menon et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). This viewpoint draws parallels to well-studied phenomenon in RLHF known as reward hacking (Amodei et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023). Reward hacking is manifestation of Goodharts law arising when LMs over-optimize the reward model, trained to represent human preference, thus also an imperfect proxy for the true task objective. The consequences of reward hacking in RLHF can be significant, leading to models misleading humans and producing unsafe behaviors (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Wen et al., 2024). Teacher hacking. Inspired by the analogy with reward hacking in RLHF, we define teacher hacking as possible phenomenon during distillation in which the student LM learns to imitate the teacher, not by better approximating the true data distribution, but by exploiting imperfections in the teacher. This raises natural questions: (1) Does teacher hacking occur in practice? and if so, (2) when does it appear?, and (3) what strategies can mitigate it? Controlled experimental setup. To answer these questions, we propose controlled experimental setup. Specifically, we introduce an oracle model that represents the groundtruth; see Figure 1 for an illustration. In this setup, the distance between the student and oracle LMs serves as golden metric. Conversely, the distance between student and teacher LMs, optimized during the fine-tuning of the student, defines proxy metric. Our setup is semi-synthetic, in the sense that prompts are sampled from real datasets but responses are sampled from the oracle LM to learn the teacher, and from the teacher LM to learn the student. We summarize our main contributions as follows. We introduce and formally define the phenomenon of teacher hacking in LM distillation, providing novel controlled experimental framework to systematically measure its importance. We show that teacher hacking occurs when distillation is performed on fixed offline dataset. Notably, we empirically found that the proxy metric initially follows polynomial convergence law, and that teacher hacking emerges when the optimization process deviates from this law. We analyze strategies to mitigate teacher hacking. Notably, we show that teacher hacking is absent when using online data generation methods, sampling directly from the teacher or the student during distillation. We relate this success to increased diversity in the dataset. We then propose cheaper practical alternative strategies to mitigate teacher hacking, such as increasing the diversity across prompts or using larger amount of offline teacher-generated data. 2.

For two sets and B, (A) denotes the space of probability measures over A, and (AB) represents the space of conditional probability meas"

"Post-training of language models (LMs) increasingly relies on the following two stages: (i) knowledge distillation, where the LM is trained to imitate a larger teacher LM, and (ii) reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where the LM is aligned by optimizing a reward model. In the second RLHF stage, a well-known challenge is reward hacking, where the LM over-optimizes the reward model. Such phenomenon is in line with Goodhart's law and can lead to degraded performance on the true objective. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar phenomenon, that we call teacher hacking, can occur during knowledge distillation. This could arise because the teacher LM is itself an imperfect approximation of the true distribution. To study this, we propose a controlled experimental setup involving: (i) an oracle LM representing the ground-truth distribution, (ii) a teacher LM distilled from the oracle, and (iii) a student LM distilled from the teacher. Our experiments reveal the following insights. When using a fixed offline dataset for distillation, teacher hacking occurs; moreover, we can detect it by observing when the optimization process deviates from polynomial convergence laws. In contrast, employing online data generation techniques effectively mitigates teacher hacking. More precisely, we identify data diversity as the key factor in preventing hacking. Overall, our findings provide a deeper understanding of the benefits and limitations of distillation for building robust and efficient LMs."
