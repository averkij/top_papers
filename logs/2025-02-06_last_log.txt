However, evaluating these models real-world effectiveness is challenging. Many of todays most popular and widely used evaluation benchmarks are heavily focused on single language or single-file, well-defined tasks. For instance, HumanEval focuses on standalone coding tasks, evaluating models for generating single-function solutions without accounting for multi-file dependencies or broader project contexts[1]. SWE-bench introduces GitHub-based evaluations for resolving real-world issues but focuses on 12 specific Python libraries[2] and 17 JavaScript Repositories [3]. DevEval broadens the domain scope by introducing multi-file coding tasks that simulate the software development lifecycle, including software design and testing [4]. However, despite its breadth, DevEval does not explicitly evaluate model consistency across multiple runs, leaving critical gap in understanding LLM reliability for real-world applications. Moreover, study by [5] introduces the concept of self-consistency in Code LLMs, emphasizing that trustworthy model should generate consistent natural language specifications for the code it generates and vice versa. Their evaluation of eleven code LLMs reveals frequent failures in maintaining self-consistency, highlighting gap between traditional accuracy metrics and the models true understanding of the shared semantics 1 between natural and programming languages. This underscores the need for more robust evaluation frameworks that go beyond conventional metrics to assess the reliability and predictability of LLM-generated code. To address these limitations, the HackerRank-ASTRA (Assessment of Software Tasks in Real-world Applications) Benchmark offers comprehensive evaluation framework for multi-file, project-based software development problems. ASTRAs initial release (v1) focuses on frontend development, featuring frameworks such as Node.js, React.js, Angular.js, Django, Java Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails, and .NET. The benchmark evaluates new feature development, where both inputs and outputs are text-based. Metrics such as mean pass@1 and mean score assess model correctness, while median standard deviation across 32 runs (k = 32) provides insights into consistency and reliability. By simulating practical coding challenges, HackerRank-ASTRA aims to provide actionable insights into the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in addressing modern software engineering needs.HackerRank-ASTRA is benchmark built from HackerRanks proprietary library of multi-file, project-based software development problems. These problems were originally designed to assess the software development skills of human developers across wide range of skill domains in realistic, project-like settings. We observed that even advanced large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when solving these problems, which motivated the creation of this benchmark.The task requires models to take both the problem statements and relevant source code files as input, with the objective of generating the requested code as output. To assess consistency, the process is repeated multiple times, with each run initialized as new conversation to eliminate prior memory"

Evaluating the real-world applicability of large language models (LLMs) provides valuable insights for their development and use in software development tasks. Existing benchmarks often focus on standalone coding problems or specific libraries, overlooking multi-file, project-based scenarios and lacking a rigorous evaluation of consistency. The HackerRank-ASTRA Benchmark introduces project-based coding problems that mirror real-world scenarios. It evaluates model consistency through 32 runs (k = 32) and median standard deviation while incorporating taxonomy-level analysis to assess sub-skill capabilities. Initial evaluations on 65 problems show that the top three models -- o1, o1-preview, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022 -- achieved comparable average scores of 75%, with no statistically significant differences in performance. Notably, Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022 demonstrated the highest consistency across problems, with low variability (SD = 0.0497), which was statistically significant compared to other models, highlighting its reliability for real-world software development tasks.

Model merging, a method that combines the parameters and embeddings of multiple fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), offers a promising approach to enhance model performance across various tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. This paper introduces Activation-Informed Merging (AIM), a technique that integrates the information from the activation space of LLMs into the merging process to improve performance and robustness. AIM is designed as a flexible, complementary solution that is applicable to any existing merging method. It aims to preserve critical weights from the base model, drawing on principles from continual learning~(CL) and model compression. Utilizing a task-agnostic calibration set, AIM selectively prioritizes essential weights during merging. We empirically demonstrate that AIM significantly enhances the performance of merged models across multiple benchmarks. Our findings suggest that considering the activation-space information can provide substantial advancements in the model merging strategies for LLMs with up to 40\% increase in benchmark performance.
