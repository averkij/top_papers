Introduction Large language models (LMs) have become cornerstone of modern AI systems due to their ability to follow natural language instructions and flexibly perform huge range of tasks *Equal contribution . Correspondence to: Loubna Ben Allal <loubna@hf.co>, Leandro von Werra <leandro@hf.co>, Thomas Wolf <thomas@hf.co>. Preprint. Under review. 1 (Touvron et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020; Dubey et al., 2024; Groeneveld et al., 2024; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Young et al., 2024; Taylor et al., 2022). LLMs are, by their nature, large, in the sense that they are models with many parameters (more than 10 billion, by current conventions). This enormity results in enormous computational costs, both during training and for inference, which can prevent LLMs from being used in resource-constrained settings. To address this issue, flurry of recent work has aimed to produce performant small (3 billion parameters or less) LMs (Gunter et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024b; AI@Meta, 2024b; Team et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023b). These small LMs are computationally inexpensive and can be run on wider range of devices (e.g. mobile phones) while providing satisfactory performance on many important tasks. key factor in the performance and behavior of LMs is the data used to train them. While important for an LM of any size, data curation has an especially outsized influence for smaller models, as their limited capacity must be carefully optimized for learning core knowledge and fundamental capabilities rather than memorizing incidental facts (Abdin et al., 2024a; Rolnick et al., 2017). Most LMs are primarily trained on text crawled from the web (Radford et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020) and state-of-the-art pipelines include sophisticated filtering and processing stages that aim to improve data quality (Li et al., 2024c; Penedo et al., 2024b;a; Soldaini et al., 2024). Recently, it has become common to include specialized data from certain domains such as software code (Kocetkov et al., 2022; Lozhkov et al., 2024) and mathematics (Paster et al., 2023; Han et al., 2024), which can improve performance not only on those domains but also more generally on challenging tasks that require reasoning (Muennighoff et al., 2023; Aryabumi et al., 2024). Motivated by the above considerations, our contributions in this paper are as follows: First, we perform careful evaluation of existing web, code, math, and instructionfollowing datasets (Section 3) to help guide training data SmolLM2 design choices, ultimately training SmolLM2 via multistage manual rebalancing of different sources to maximize performance (Section 4). Such on-the-fly rebalancing is promising approach for large-scale training runs which can be sufficiently costly (around 1e23 FLOPs, or $250,000 USD worth of GPU compute for SmolLM2) to preclude running multiple full-scale training runs. Following standard practice, we also develop an instruction-tuned variant of SmolLM2 (Section 5). Additionally, after finding that existing datasets were too small and/or low-quality, we created the new datasets FineMath, Stack-Edu, and SmolTalk (for mathematics, code, and instruction-following respectively). Ultimately, we show that both the base and instruction-tuned variants of SmolLM2 are state-of-the-art among similarly sized models (Section 4.7 and Section 5.4). 2. Background Training modern LM typically begins with pretraining on large amount (e.g. trillions of tokens) of unstructured text. Pretraining helps the model fit the structure of language (Clark, 2019) and store factual knowledge (Petroni et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2020) and therefore has proven to be vital part of LM training, which made the composition of the pretraining dataset key consideration. The datahungry nature of pretraining has led to the use of largescale web scrapes (com; ope; ant) which in their raw form can lead to poorly performing LMs (Penedo et al., 2024b). Consequently, the primary means of curation for modern LM pretraining datasets involves designing sophisticated pipelines for automatically filtering and reformatting web texts (Penedo et al., 2024a;b; Soldaini et al., 2024; Soboleva et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024c) that aim to keep enough data to avoid detrimental repetition (Muennighoff et al., 2023) while discarding any data that is not high-quality. Apart from web text, including specialized data from certain domains code (Kocetkov et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a) and math (Paster et al., 2023; Han et al., 2024; Wang et al.; Azerbayev et al., 2023) in particular can improve model performance on tasks that involve reasoning and world knowledge (Muennighoff et al., 2023; Aryabumi et al., 2024; Lewkowycz e"

Text:"Token Assorted: Mixing Latent and Text Tokens for Improved Language Model Reasoning DiJia Su 1 Hanlin Zhu * 2 Yingchen Xu * 1 3 Jiantao Jiao 2 Yuandong Tian 1 Qinqing Zheng 1 Abstract Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning when trained on chainof-thought (CoT) data, where the step-by-step thought process is explicitly outlined by text tokens. However, this results in lengthy inputs where many words support textual coherence rather than core reasoning information, and processing these inputs consumes substantial computation resources. In this work, we propose hybrid representation of the reasoning process, where we partially abstract away the initial reasoning steps using latent discrete tokens generated by VQ-VAE, significantly reducing the length of reasoning traces. We explore the use of latent trace abstractions in two scenarios: 1) training the model from scratch for the Keys-Finding Maze problem, 2) fine-tuning LLMs on this hybrid data with an extended vocabulary including unseen latent tokens, for both logical and mathematical reasoning problems. To facilitate effective learning, we introduce simple training procedure that randomly mixes latent and text tokens, which enables fast adaptation to new latent tokens. Our approach consistently outperforms the baselines methods in various benchmarks, such as Math (+4.2%, Llama-3.2-1B), GSM8K (+4.1%, Llama3.2-3B), and Fresh-Gaokao-Math-2023 (+13.3%, Llama-3.1-8B) with an average reduction of 17% in reasoning traces length. 5 2 0 2 5 ] .

We present a fundamental discovery that challenges our understanding of how complex reasoning emerges in large language models. While conventional wisdom suggests that sophisticated reasoning tasks demand extensive training data (>100,000 examples), we demonstrate that complex mathematical reasoning abilities can be effectively elicited with surprisingly few examples. Through comprehensive experiments, our proposed model LIMO demonstrates unprecedented performance in mathematical reasoning. With merely 817 curated training samples, LIMO achieves 57.1% accuracy on AIME and 94.8% on MATH, improving from previous SFT-based models' 6.5% and 59.2% respectively, while only using 1% of the training data required by previous approaches. LIMO demonstrates exceptional out-of-distribution generalization, achieving 40.5% absolute improvement across 10 diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x more data, challenging the notion that SFT leads to memorization rather than generalization. Based on these results, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning capabilities can emerge through minimal but precisely orchestrated demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis posits that the elicitation threshold for complex reasoning is determined by two key factors: (1) the completeness of the model's encoded knowledge foundation during pre-training, and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples as "cognitive templates" that show the model how to utilize its knowledge base to solve complex reasoning tasks. To facilitate reproducibility and future research in data-efficient reasoning, we release LIMO as a comprehensive open-source suite at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/LIMO.

"We present a fundamental discovery that challenges our understanding of how complex reasoning emerges in large language models. While conventional wisdom suggests that sophisticated reasoning tasks demand extensive training data (>100,000 examples), we demonstrate that complex mathematical reasoning abilities can be effectively elicited with surprisingly few examples. Through comprehensive experiments, our proposed model LIMO demonstrates unprecedented performance in mathematical reasoning. With merely 817 curated training samples, LIMO achieves 57.1% accuracy on AIME and 94.8% on MATH, improving from previous SFT-based models' 6.5% and 59.2% respectively, while only using 1% of the training data required by previous approaches. LIMO demonstrates exceptional out-of-distribution generalization, achieving 40.5% absolute improvement across 10 diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x more data, challenging the notion that SFT leads to memorization rather than generalization. Based on these results, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning capabilities can emerge through minimal but precisely orchestrated demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis posits that the elicitation threshold for complex reasoning is determined by two key factors: (1) the completeness of the model's encoded knowledge foundation during pre-training, and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples as "cognitive templates" that show the model how to utilize its knowledge base to solve complex reasoning tasks. To facilitate reproducibility and future research in data-efficient reasoning, we release LIMO as a comprehensive open-source suite at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/LIMO."

While large language models have facilitated breakthroughs in many applications of artificial intelligence, their inherent largeness makes them computationally expensive and challenging to deploy in resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we document the development of SmolLM2, a state-of-the-art "small" (1.7 billion parameter) language model (LM). To attain strong performance, we overtrain SmolLM2 on ~11 trillion tokens of data using a multi-stage training process that mixes web text with specialized math, code, and instruction-following data. We additionally introduce new specialized datasets (FineMath, Stack-Edu, and SmolTalk) at stages where we found existing datasets to be problematically small or low-quality. To inform our design decisions, we perform both small-scale ablations as well as a manual refinement process that updates the dataset mixing rates at each stage based on the performance at the previous stage. Ultimately, we demonstrate that SmolLM2 outperforms other recent small LMs including Qwen2.5-1.5B and Llama3.2-1B. To facilitate future research on LM development as well as applications of small LMs, we release both SmolLM2 as well as all of the datasets we prepared in the course of this project.

Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning when trained on chainof-thought (CoT) data, where the step-by-step thought process is explicitly outlined by text tokens. However, this results in lengthy inputs where many words support textual coherence rather than core reasoning information, and processing these inputs consumes substantial computation resources. In this work, we propose a hybrid representation of the reasoning process, where we partially abstract away the initial reasoning steps using latent discrete tokens generated by VQ-VAE, significantly reducing the length of reasoning traces. We explore the use of latent trace abstractions in two scenarios: 1) training the model from scratch for the Keys-Finding Maze problem, 2) fine-tuning LLMs on this hybrid data with an extended vocabulary including unseen latent tokens, for both logical and mathematical reasoning problems. To facilitate effective learning, we introduce a simple training procedure that randomly mixes latent and text tokens, which enables fast adaptation to new latent tokens. Our approach consistently outperforms the baselines methods in various benchmarks.
