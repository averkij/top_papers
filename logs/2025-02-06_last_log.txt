Text:"Riddle Me This! Stealthy Membership Inference for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Ali Naseh University of Massachusetts Amherst Yuefeng Peng University of Massachusetts Amherst Anshuman Suri Northeastern University 5 2 0 2 1 ] . [ 1 6 0 3 0 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate grounded responses by leveraging external knowledge databases without altering model parameters. Although the absence of weight tuning prevents leakage via model parameters, it introduces the risk of inference adversaries exploiting retrieved documents in the models context. Existing methods for membership inference and data extraction often rely on jailbreaking or carefully crafted unnatural queries, which can be easily detected or thwarted with query rewriting techniques common in RAG systems. In this work, we present Interrogation Attack (IA), membership inference technique targeting documents in the RAG datastore. By crafting natural-text queries that are answerable only with the target documents presence, our approach demonstrates successful inference with just 30 queries while remaining stealthy; straightforward detectors identify adversarial prompts from existing methods up to 76 more frequently than those generated by our attack. We observe 2 improvement in TPR@1%FPR over prior inference attacks across diverse RAG configurations, all while costing less than $0.02 per document inference. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) in machine learning attempt to discern if given record was part of given models training data. MIAs thus have great utility for privacy auditing, copyright violations [31], and test-set contamination [37]. While Figure 1: ROC for Gemma-2 (2B) as generator, GTE as retriever, for NFCorpus dataset. Our attack (IA) consistently achieves near-perfect membership inference. MIAs generally relate to the information contained in the models parameters (with the model having seen some data during training),"
