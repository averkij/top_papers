Text:"Tencent Hunyuan Hunyuan3D 2.5: Towards High-Fidelity 3D Assets Generation with Ultimate Details Tencent Hunyuan3D https://3d.hunyuan.tencent.com https://github.com/Tencent/Hunyuan3D-In this report, we present Hunyuan3D 2.5, robust suite of 3D diffusion models aimed at generating high-fidelity and detailed textured 3D assets. Hunyuan3D 2.5 follows two-stages pipeline of its previous version Hunyuan3D 2.0, while demonstrating substantial advancements in both shape and texture generation. In terms of shape generation, we introduce new shape foundation model LATTICE, which is trained with scaled high-quality datasets, model-size, and compute. Our largest model reaches 10B parameters and generates sharp and detailed 3D shape with precise image-3D following while keeping mesh surface clean and smooth, significantly closing the gap between generated and handcrafted 3D shapes. In terms of texture generation, it is upgraded with phyiscal-based rendering (PBR) via novel multi-view architecture extended from Hunyuan3D 2.0 Paint model. Our extensive evaluation shows that Hunyuan3D 2.5 significantly outperforms previous methods in both shape and end-to-end texture generation. 5 2 0 2 9 1 ] . [ 1 4 0 5 6 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: High quality 3D assets generated by Hunyuan3D 2.5.3D generation has rapidly developed in recent years, becoming core driver of innovation and growth across various industries. From game development to embodied AI, from film special effects to virtual reality, the application scenarios of 3D models continue to expand, demonstrating their immense potential and value. With advancements in artificial intelligence, 3D generation has become more efficient and powerful, particularly in areas such as automated modeling and texturing, further simplifying the creative process and enhancing production efficiency. Notably, recent 3D shape diffusion models based on 3dshape2vecset (Zhang et al., 2023) have pioneered revolution in the 3D shape generation pipeline, as demonstrated by works such as CLAY (Zhang et al., 2024b), Hunyuan3D 2.0 (Zhao et al., 2025), and TripoSG (Li et al., 2025). Direct3D (Wu et al., 2024b),from another aspect, shown the potential of compressing and generating the shape via triplane. More recently, Trellis (Xiang et al., 2024) has emerged as promising pipeline for high-quality textured 3D generation, leveraging its invented structured 3D latents as representations. Nevertheless, existing models are still limited for generating complex objects with finegrained details as demonstrated in figure 2. It remains an open problem how we could generate high-fidelity and detailed shape while maintaining smooth surface and sharp edges. High-quality textures play crucial role in enhancing the visual realism and detail representation of 3D assets. Recently, Numerous texture generation methods based on multiview diffusion (Zhao et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2024b; Vainer et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024a; Tang et al., 2025; Long et al., 2024; Wang & Shi, 2023; Shi et al., 2023b;a) have emerged, alleviating global consistency issue of inpaintingbased methods (Huang et al., 2024a; Wu et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2024c; Ceylan et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2024a; Chen et al., 2023a; Richardson et al., 2023) and synchronization techniques (Liu et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2024a). However, challenges remain in generating highly consistent multiview images, which can lead to artifacts and seams during the fusion and baking stages. Moreover, traditional RGB textures can no longer meet the demands for photorealistic 3D asset generation, while PBR material generation solution is not available in open source community. This report presents Hunyuan3D 2.5, robust suite of 3D diffusion models aimed at generating high-fidelity and detailed textured 3D assets. Hunyuan3D 2.5 builds upon the twostage pipeline of its predecessor Hunyuan3D 2.0 (Zhao et al., 2025) and 2.1 (Hunyuan3D et al., 2025), while showcasing significant advancements in both shape generation and texture synthesis. Figure 2: Drawbacks of existing methods: failure at detail generation and incorrect PBR. In the first stage of shape generation, we introduce new shape foundation model LATTICE, which has been trained on large-scale, high-quality datasets with increased model size and computational resources. We found that this new model exhibits stable improvement when scaling up the model. Benifit from these characteristics, our largest model generates detailed and sharp 3D shape with precise alignment to corresponding images while maintaining clean and smooth surfaces, significantly closing the gap between generated and handcrafted 3D shapes. In the second stage of texture generation, we extend the Hunyuan3D 2.0 (Zhao et al., 2025) and 2.1 (Hunyuan3D et al., 2025) texture generation model into high-fidelity material generation framework. Adhering to the principled BRDF model, our approach produces multi-view albedo, roughness, and metallic maps simultaneously. This aims to precisely describe the surface reflection properties of generated 3D assets and accurately simulate geometric microsurface distributions, 2 Figure 3: Overview of Hunyuan3D 2.5 pipeline. It separates the 3D asset generation into two stages: first, it generates the shape, and then it creates the texture based on that shape. thereby achieving more realistic and detailed rendering results. Furthermore, we introduce dual-phase resolution enhancement strategy to strengthen texture-geometry coordination, thereby improving end-to-end visual quality. We perform extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations as well as user studies in terms of shape generation and end-to-end texture generation, across diverse range of in-the-wild input images. The results demonstrate that Hunyuan3D 2.5 outperforms state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source commercial models.Hunyuan3D 2.5 is an image-to-3D generation model, which follows the same overall architecture of Hunyuan3D 2.0 (Zhao et al., 2025), as shown in figure 3. In nutshell, the input image is first processed by an image processor to remove the background and perform proper resizing. Then, shape generation model is conditioned on the input image and generates the 3D mesh without texture. The mesh is further processed to extract normal, UV map, and etc. After that, texture generation model is called to generate the texture with previous outputs. 2.1 Detailed Shape Generation Hunyu"
