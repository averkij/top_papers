Text:"5 2 0 2 9 1 ] . [ 1 5 3 0 6 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r Vision-Guided Chunking Is All You Need: Enhancing RAG with Multimodal Document Understanding Vishesh Tripathi, Tanmay Odapally, Indraneel Das, Uday Allu, and Biddwan Ahmed AI Research Team, Yellow.ai Abstract Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have revolutionized information retrieval and question answering, but traditional text-based chunking methods struggle with complex document structures, multi-page tables, embedded figures, and contextual dependencies across page boundaries. We present novel multimodal document chunking approach that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to process PDF documents in batches while maintaining semantic coherence and structural integrity. Our method processes documents in configurable page batches with cross-batch context preservation, enabling accurate handling of tables spanning multiple pages, embedded visual elements, and procedural content. We evaluate our approach on our internal benchmark dataset of diverse PDF documents, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and downstream RAG performance. Our vision-guided approach achieves better quantitative performance on our internal benchmark compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing better preservation of document structure and semantic coherence. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [Lewis et al., 2020] has emerged as an important paradigm for enhancing large language models with external knowledge sources. The effectiveness of RAG systems fundamentally depends on the quality of document chunking - the process of segmenting documents into coherent, retrievable units. Traditional approaches rely on simple text extraction followed by rule-based or sliding-window chunking [Carbonell & Goldstein, 1998], which often fails to preserve semantic coherence and structural relationships in complex documents. Modern documents, particularly technical manuals, research papers, and business reports"
