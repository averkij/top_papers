Text:"5 2 0 2 9 1 ] . [ 1 9 4 3 6 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r Watermarking Autoregressive Image Generation Nikola Jovanović1,2,, Ismail Labiad1,3, Tomáš Souček1, Martin Vechev2, Pierre Fernandez1 1Meta FAIR, 2ETH Zurich, 3Université Paris-Saclay Work done during Meta internship. Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as promising approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work, we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking techniques to this setting. We identify key challenge: the lack of reverse cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations, neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) custom tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate, our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically grounded p-values. Correspondence: nikola.jovanovic@inf.ethz.ch, pfz@meta.com Code: https://github.com/facebookresearch/wmar Figure 1 We watermark autoregressively generated images together with text in theoretically principled way by adapting LLM watermarking. We identify and address the novel challenges present in this setting (Section 3) via custom (de)tokenizer finetuning procedure (Section 3.1) and watermark synchronization layer (Section 3.2). Autoregressive models are powerful frameworks for understanding and generating diverse content types. By converting multiple modalities into discrete representations via custom tokenizers [78, 97, 110], single transformer is able to seamlessly process multiple domains, including text, images [11, 15, 93, 102],"

A new method called Prompt Inversion from Logprob Sequences (PILS) recovers hidden prompts in language models by analyzing the low-dimensional subspace of the model's next-token probabilities, achieving higher recovery rates and better generalization than previous methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Language model inversion seeks to recover hidden prompts using only language model outputs. This capability has implications for security and accountability in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an API-protected language model's system message. We propose a new method -- prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) -- that recovers hidden prompts by gleaning clues from the model's next-token probabilities over the course of multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace. This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving 2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on 16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for logit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than previously known.

A novel watermarking technique for autoregressive image generation models achieves reliable detection through improved reverse cycle-consistency and synchronization layers.  					AI-generated summary 				 Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as a promising approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work, we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations, neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate, our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically grounded p-values.
