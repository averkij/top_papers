Text:"5 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 0 3 9 9 0 . 6 0 5 2 : r From Intention to Execution: Probing the Generalization Boundaries of Vision-Language-Action Models Irving Fang Juexiao Zhang Shengbang Tong Chen FengOne promise that Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold over traditional imitation learning for robotics is to leverage the broad generalization capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce versatile, generalist robot policies. However, current evaluations of VLAs remain insufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to the lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that incorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend to investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization capabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies on real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions, which creates barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this gap, we introduce unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across 10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this suite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that while VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high-level planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably translate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution observations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action execution. Moreover, fine-tuning on action data can erode the original VLMs generalist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code to serve as standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on closing the perception-to-action gap. More information, including the source code, can be found at https://ai4ce.github.io/INT-ACT/Building on the significant progress of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) [7, 13, 23, 30] in computer vision and multi-modal tasks, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) [2, 16, 19] models are emerging to transfer these generalist skills to embodied agents and robotics. The ultimate goal is to create robots that can interpret natural language instructions, perceive and plan under complex and diverse environments, and execute versatile behaviors, all under fewor zero-shot scenarios. This goal calls for strong generalization capability beyond the training and fine-tuning of robotics data. Early results are encouraging: VLAs can natively follow high-level language instructions in cluttered scenes and perform highly dexterous manipulation on challenging objects [2, 16, 19]. Moreover, since VLAs are typically pre-trained on large-scale cross-embodiment dataset [9], they can be fine-tuned on new tasks with novel configurations for quick adaptation, partially alleviating the data scarcity problem plaguing robotics research. Equal contribution Project Lead Preprint. Under review. Despite this progress, there is no consensus on how to systematically measure the generalization capability of VLAs, which is supposedly strong point of leveraging the modern VLMs over previous perceptual systems. Notably, the current evaluation procedure for VLA generally relies on: 1. Recent simulation benchmarks such as CALVIN [27], LIBERO [22] and SimplerEnv [20] are equipped with natural language instructions, enabling the evaluation of vision-language-action (VLA) models instruction-following capabilities, which differentiate them from the more traditional benchmarks such as RLBench [17] or RoboMimic [26] that focus primarily on low-level control and imitation, with limited or no support for diverse language-conditioned tasks. However, the variety of tasks is relatively limited, and VLAs generalization capability is not targeted. 2. Real-world robot setup as seen in [2, 16, 19]. While this type of evaluation offers endless flexibility and opportunities to test the generalization of VLA policy, it has considerably bigger barriers than any vision language benchmark due to the time and monetary commitment required. As result, it remains unclear to many how well the state-of-the-art VLA models can generalize beyond the robotics datasets they train on by leveraging the remarkable generalization capability of their built-in VLM. To fill this void, we propose unified probing suite comprising 50 simulationbased tasks organized into 10 categories that vary systematically along three categories: Object diversity: out-of-distribution (OOD) object, appearance, and affordances unseen during embodiment-finetuning. Language complexity: from templated commands (e.g., Put on B) to compositional, knowledge and reasoning-intensive instructions. Vision-language thinking: parsing various distractors that are challenging at the perception or planning level. In this work, we make two primary contributions: We introduce and open-source INT-ACT, comprehensive VLA generalization probing suite comprising 50 tasks across 3 major categories and 10 subcategories, substantially extending the scope of existing VLA benchmarks. Through extensive benchmarking, we uncover two key failure modes in current state-of-the-art VLA models: persistent and pronounced Intention-Action Gap, where strong semantic understanding under distribution shift fails to translate into reliable execution. Fragile multimodal generalization, particularly under language variations and compounding visual-language distribution shifts.In robotics, Robotic Foundation Models aim to equip embodied agents with similar generalist abilities by training on diverse robotics datasets like Open-X Embodiment [9]. Early works, such as RT-1 [3], Octo [29], and RDT [25], typically use separate pretrained encoders (e.g., T5 [37] for language, SigLIP [44] for vision) to encode multimodal inputs, and subsequently train imitation learning policies (e.g., diffusion policies [8]) to map encoded features to robot actions. Following the success of VLMs [1, 6, 7, 18, 30, 39], Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to integrate the powerful pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) directly, instead of leveraging only pretrained encoders. For instance, RT-2 [4] fine-tunes PaLM-E [11] and PaLI-X [6] on combined vision-language and robotics data via autoregressive token prediction, treating discretized robot actions as tokens.

A unified benchmark suite evaluates Vision-Language-Action models' generalization and motor execution capabilities, highlighting the disparity between perceptual understanding and precise action execution.  					AI-generated summary 				 One promise that Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold over traditional imitation learning for robotics is to leverage the broad generalization capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce versatile, "generalist" robot policies. However, current evaluations of VLAs remain insufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to the lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that incorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend to investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization capabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies on real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions, which creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this gap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across 10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this suite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that while VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high level planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably translate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution observations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action execution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's generalist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code to serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on closing the perception-to-action gap.
