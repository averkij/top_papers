Text:"Long-term Traffic Simulation with Interleaved Autoregressive Motion and Scenario Generation Xiuyu Yang* Shuhan Tan* Philipp Krähenbühl5 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 3 1 2 7 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r Figure 1. Long-term traffic simulation with InfGen and prior SOTA [31]. InfGen keeps scene layout realistic while [31] becomes empty.An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic longterm point-to-point trip that self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, unified nexttoken prediction model that performs interleaved closedloop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-theart in short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be released at https://orangesodahub.github.io/InfGen. 1. Introduction Traffic simulation is cornerstone of the extensive and safe development of self-driving systems. The ultimate goal of traffic simulation is to create realistic trip-level driving experiences that faithfully reflect real-world self-driving con- *Equal contribution. Work done while Xiuyu interned at UT Austin. ditions [1, 7, 9, 13, 30]. simulator should provide realistic model of the environment, the ego-vehicle, and all other traffic agents throughout the trip. Existing simulators easily handle an expansive static environment [1, 9, 30] and intricate ego-vehicle dynamics [7, 13]. However, they often lack stable long-term simulation of non-ego traffic agents. In this paper, we introduce InfGen, long-term traffic simulator: Given short (1 second) driving-log, InfGen simulates realistic traffic flow around the ego agent for up to 30 seconds. This long-term setting leads to new challenges. The ego agent may move outside its initial simulation area, leading to logged agents moving out of sight and becoming irrelevant. Furthermore, when the ego agents drive into new map area not covered in the log, these street areas have no agents. Gradually, scenario becomes sparser and eventually empty (Fig. 1 bottom row). This is clearly unrealistic. InfGen models this by combining closed-loop motion simulation with scene generation to remove exiting agents and spawn new agents according to the spatial scene layout. InfGen  (Fig. 2)  is unified autoregressive transformer with interleaved token prediction. It handles temporal motion simulation and spatial scene generation in unified model. We design set of tokenizers to convert task-specific behaviors of motion simulation and scenario generation into discrete tokens. We then add mode-control tokens to mark 1 recently, GIGAFLOW [7] shows strong agent performance emerges from large-scale self-play in simulation. For this direction, nuPlan [1] and WOSAC [14] provide data and benchmark for fair comparisons. All these works focus on simulating motions of agents existed in the history, leading to unrealistic scene layouts under long-term rollout. InfGen solves this issue with interleaved scene generation, maintaining realistic scene layout across the rollout horizon. Traffic Scenario Generation. This line of work focuses on generation realistic and interesting traffic scenarios. Early works like SceneGen [23] and TrafficGen [10] generates agent initial poses on an empty map. Another popular direction is to generate near-collision scenarios with adversarial optimization [4, 17, 29, 33, 35]. More recent works like LCTGen [24] enables better customizations of the generated scenarios in forms of text [24, 44], scenario queries [8] or cost functions [45]. SLEDGE [6] combine generative models with rule-based traffic simulation to synthesize dynamic driving scenarios. These works either focus on static scene layout initialization, or only generate short-term open-loop scenarios. In contract, InfGen conducts dynamic scenario layout generation during closedloop rollout, enabling stable long-term simulation. Concurrent works like SceneDiffuser++ [27] and ScenarioDreamer [19] introduces vectorized latent diffusion approach to generate realistic and diverse driving simulation environments. Interleaved Next-Token Prediction. Recent advances in vision-language models have sparked works that unify generation and understanding tasks with interleaved mixedmodal token sequences. For example, Chameleon [3] proposes to train LLMs on interleaved text and image tokens in any arbitrary sequences. This line of works show strong performance on traditional multimodal tasks, but also longform mixed modal generation that interleaves between image and text generation [3, 12, 28, 32, 37]. InfGen follows the same philosophy but focus on different pair of modalities: temporal agent motion and spatial agent layout. 3. Problem Formulation The goal of traditional traffic simulation [14] is to predict future agent trajectories given historical observations (with time span TH) and static map. Specifically, at timestep t0, we are given the static map and the history states of all the agents A0:t0 = {a1 }, where each agent ai has history states up to timestep t0. The standard task is to predict future agent states over fixed horizon , formulated as estimating the conditional distribution: p(At0+1:T M, A0:t0). Prior work [25, 31] factorize the simulation on the time axis and turn it to an autoregres- , . . . , aN , a2 0:t0 0:t0 0:t Figure 2. Overview of InfGen interleaved next-token-prediction process. Colors mark different token modalities. the task switch between the two tasks, indicating what the current task is and when to switch. This design allows us to convert each real log into single ordered sequence of tokens containing interleaved data of both tasks. We directly train InfGen with the next token prediction objective endto-end on real data. Noticeably, thanks to the next token prediction formulation, we can train InfGen on short-term driving logs and produce stable long-term rollouts, up to 6 longer than the training horizon (Fig. 1 top). We show detailed pipeline of InfGen in Fig. 3. We show in Section 5 that InfGen significantly outperforms prior SOTA models [31, 41] in 30-second long-term traffic simulation "

Text:"5 2 0 2 8 1 ] . [ 1 2 4 4 5 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r Hunyuan3D 2.1: From Images to High-Fidelity 3D Assets with Production-Ready PBR Material Tencent Hunyuan https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/Hunyuan3D-2.1 Figure 1: Gallery of 3D assets generated by Hunyuan3D 2.1.3D AI-generated content (AIGC) is passionate field that has significantly accelerated the creation of 3D models in gaming, film, and design. Despite the development of several groundbreaking models that have revolutionized 3D generation, the field remains largely accessible only to researchers, developers, and designers due to the complexities involved in collecting, processing, and training 3D models. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan3D 2.1 as case study in this tutorial. This tutorial offers comprehensive, step-by-step guide on processing 3D data, training 3D generative model, and evaluating its performance using Hunyuan3D 2.1, an advanced system for producing high-resolution, textured 3D assets. The system comprises two core components: the Hunyuan3D-DiT for shape generation and the Hunyuan3D-Paint for texture synthesis. We will explore the entire workflow, including data preparation, model architecture, training strategies, evaluation metrics, and deployment. By the conclusion of this tutorial, you will have the knowledge to finetune or develop robust 3D generative model suitable for applications in gaming, virtual reality, and industrial design.While recent breakthroughs in 2D image and video generationpowered by diffusion models [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]have revolutionized content creation, the field of 3D generative modeling lags behind. Current methods for 3D asset synthesis remain fragmented, with incremental progress in foundational techniques such as latent representation learning [7], geometric refinement [8, 9, 10], and texture synthesis [11, 12, 13]. Among these, CLAY [11] marks milestone as the first framework to demonstrate the viability of diffusion models for high-quality 3D generation. Yet, unlike the thriving open-source ecosystems in image ( e.g., Stable Diffusion [2]), language ( e.g., LLaMA [14]), and video ( e.g., HunyuanVideo [5], and Wan 2.1 [6]), the 3D domain lacks robust, scalable foundation model to drive widespread innovation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hunyuan3D 2.1, comprehensive 3D asset creation system to generate textured mesh from single image input. It is mainly built on two fully open-source foundation models: 1) Hunyuan3D-DiT: shape-generation model combining flow-based diffusion architecture with high-fidelity mesh autoencoder (Hunyuan3D-ShapeVAE); 2) Hunyuan3D-Paint: mesh-conditioned multi-view diffusion model for PBR material generation, producing high-quality, multi-channel-aligned, and view-consistent textures. For shape generation, we leverage Hunyuan3D-ShapeVAE and Hunyuan3D-DiT to achieve highquality and high-fidelity shape generation. Specifically, Hunyuan3D-ShapeVAE employs mesh surface importance sampling to enhance sharp edges and variational token length to improve intricate geometric details. Hunyuan3D-DiT inherits the recent advanced flow matching models [15, 3] to construct scalable and flexible diffusion model. For texture synthesis, Hunyuan3D-Paint introduces multi-view PBR diffusion that generates albedo, metallic, and roughness maps for meshes. Notably, Hunyuan3D-Paint incorporates spatial-aligned multi-attention module to align albedo and MR maps, 3D-aware RoPE to enhance cross-view consistency, and an illumination-invariant training strategy to produce light-free albedo maps robust to varying lighting conditions. Hunyuan3D 2.1 separates shape and texture generation into distinct stages, an more advanced strategy proven effective upon previous large reconstruction models [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. This modularity allows users to generate untextured meshes only or apply textures to custom assets, enhancing flexibility for industrial applications. We rigorously evaluate Hunyuan3D 2.1 against leading commercial and recent open-source models, e.g., Michelangelo [8], Craftsman 1.5 [24], Trellis [25], TripoSG [9], Step1X-3D [26] and Direct3DS2 [27]. Quantitative metrics and visual comparisons confirm its superiority in geometric detail preservation, texture-photo consistency, and human preference. This tutorial unpacks the architecture, data processing, training, and evaluation of Hunyuan3D 2.1, providing practitioners with the tools to harness its capabilities for diverse 3D generation tasks.In this section, we aim to describe the data processing for training the shape generation model and texture model. We start to introduce the dataset preparation, and then present how to obtain the relevant training and testing data for the shape generation model and texture model. 2.1 Dataset collection For shape generation, we collect 100K+ textured and untextured 3D data from public datasets and custom datasets. The public dataset comes mainly from ShapeNet [28], ModelNet40 [29], Thingi10K [30], and Objaverse [31, 32]. For texture synthesis, we filter 70K+ human-annotated high-quality data following strict curation protocols from Objaverse-XL [32]. 2 2.2 Data preprocessing for shape generation 2.2.1 Normalization The normalization process begins by calculating the axis-aligned bounding box for each 3D object, ensuring all subsequent operations work in standardized coordinate space. We apply uniform scaling to fit the object within unit cube centered at the origin, preserving aspect ratios while maintaining consistent scale across the entire dataset. This spatial normalization is particularly crucial for neural networks to learn consistent geometric patterns, as it eliminates size variations that could otherwise dominate the learned features. For point cloud data, the implementation involves centering the cloud by subtracting its centroid, then scaling all points by the maximum Euclidean distance from the center, as shown in the provided Python snippet. This approach guarantees that all objects occupy approximately the same volume in the normalized space while preserving their original geometric relationships. 2.2.2 Watertight The IGL library generates watertight surfaces by constructing signed distance field (SDF) from defective geometry. We initialize uniform 3D query grid encompassing the input mesh. For each query point Qg, IGL computes: SDF(q) = distance_to_mesh(q, V, ) (cid:125) (cid:123)(cid:122) nearest surface distance (cid:124) sign(ω(q)) (cid:123)(cid"

InfiniPot-V is a training-free, query-agnostic framework that compresses the key-value cache during video encoding to maintain a fixed memory cap for streaming video understanding, enhancing real-time performance and accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can reason over hour-long video, yet their key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with time--quickly exceeding the fixed memory of phones, AR glasses, and edge robots. Prior compression schemes either assume the whole video and user query are available offline or must first build the full cache, so memory still scales with stream length. InfiniPot-V is the first training-free, query-agnostic framework that enforces a hard, length-independent memory cap for streaming video understanding. During video encoding it monitors the cache and, once a user-set threshold is reached, runs a lightweight compression pass that (i) removes temporally redundant tokens via Temporal-axis Redundancy (TaR) metric and (ii) keeps semantically significant tokens via Value-Norm (VaN) ranking. Across four open-source MLLMs and four long-video and two streaming-video benchmarks, InfiniPot-V cuts peak GPU memory by up to 94%, sustains real-time generation, and matches or surpasses full-cache accuracy--even in multi-turn dialogues. By dissolving the KV cache bottleneck without retraining or query knowledge, InfiniPot-V closes the gap for on-device streaming video assistants.

InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model, enables stable long-term traffic simulation by interleaving closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other methods in long-term (30s) simulation.
