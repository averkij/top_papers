[ 1 2 4 8 4 2 . 5 0 5 2 : r a Harsh Chaudhari1,2, Jamie Hayes2*, Matthew Jagielski2*, Ilia Shumailov2*, Milad Nasr2 and Alina Oprea1 *Equal Contribution, 1Northeastern University, 2Google DeepMind Model distillation has become an essential technique for creating smaller, deployable language models that retain the capabilities of larger systems. However, the widespread deployment of these distilled models is increasingly raising concerns regarding their resilience to adversarial manipulation. This paper investigates the vulnerability of distilled language models to adversarial injection of biased content during training. More broadly, we demonstrate that an adversary can inject subtle biases into teacher model through minimal data poisoning during training, which not only propagates to the distilled student model but also becomes significantly amplified. We propose two distinct modes of propagation: Untargeted Propagation, where adversarial bias affects multiple tasks, and Targeted Propagation, which focuses on specific task while maintaining normal behavior elsewhere. With only 25 poisoned samples (0.25% poisoning rate), the student model generates biased responses 76.9% of the time in targeted propagation scenariohigher than the 69.4% observed in the teacher model. In case of Untargeted propagation, the adversarial bias appears 6.0 29.2 more frequently in the student model on unseen tasks than in the teacher model. We validate these findings across six bias types (including targeted advertisements, phishing links, narrative manipulations, and insecure coding practices), various distillation methods, and different data modalities spanning both text and code generation. Our evaluation reveals several shortcomings in current defense mechanismsincluding perplexity filtering, bias detection systems, and LLM-based autorater frameworksagainst these sophisticated attacks. These results expose significant security and trustworthiness vulnerabilities in disti"

Model distillation has become essential for creating smaller, deployable language models that retain larger system capabilities. However, widespread deployment raises concerns about resilience to adversarial manipulation. This paper investigates vulnerability of distilled models to adversarial injection of biased content during training. We demonstrate that adversaries can inject subtle biases into teacher models through minimal data poisoning, which propagates to student models and becomes significantly amplified. We propose two propagation modes: Untargeted Propagation, where bias affects multiple tasks, and Targeted Propagation, focusing on specific tasks while maintaining normal behavior elsewhere. With only 25 poisoned samples (0.25% poisoning rate), student models generate biased responses 76.9% of the time in targeted scenarios - higher than 69.4% in teacher models. For untargeted propagation, adversarial bias appears 6x-29x more frequently in student models on unseen tasks. We validate findings across six bias types (targeted advertisements, phishing links, narrative manipulations, insecure coding practices), various distillation methods, and different modalities spanning text and code generation. Our evaluation reveals shortcomings in current defenses - perplexity filtering, bias detection systems, and LLM-based autorater frameworks - against these attacks. Results expose significant security vulnerabilities in distilled models, highlighting need for specialized safeguards. We propose practical design principles for building effective adversarial bias mitigation strategies.

AReaL, a fully asynchronous reinforcement learning system, decouples generation and training to achieve higher GPU utilization and up to 2.57x training speedup for large language models on reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a trending paradigm for training large language models (LLMs), particularly for reasoning tasks. Effective RL for LLMs requires massive parallelization and poses an urgent need for efficient training systems. Most existing large-scale RL systems for LLMs are synchronous by alternating generation and training in a batch setting, where the rollouts in each training batch are generated by the same (or latest) model. This stabilizes RL training but suffers from severe system-level inefficiency. Generation must wait until the longest output in the batch is completed before model update, resulting in GPU underutilization. We present AReaL, a fully asynchronous RL system that completely decouples generation from training. Rollout workers in AReaL continuously generate new outputs without waiting, while training workers update the model whenever a batch of data is collected. AReaL also incorporates a collection of system-level optimizations, leading to substantially higher GPU utilization. To stabilize RL training, AReaL balances the workload of rollout and training workers to control data staleness, and adopts a staleness-enhanced PPO variant to better handle outdated training samples. Extensive experiments on math and code reasoning benchmarks show that AReaL achieves up to 2.57times training speedup compared to the best synchronous systems with the same number of GPUs and matched or even improved final performance. The code of AReaL is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/AReaL/.

"AReaL, a fully asynchronous reinforcement learning system, decouples generation and training to achieve higher GPU utilization and up to 2.57x training speedup for large language models on reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a trending paradigm for training large language models (LLMs), particularly for reasoning tasks. Effective RL for LLMs requires massive parallelization and poses an urgent need for efficient training systems. Most existing large-scale RL systems for LLMs are synchronous by alternating generation and training in a batch setting, where the rollouts in each training batch are generated by the same (or latest) model. This stabilizes RL training but suffers from severe system-level inefficiency. Generation must wait until the longest output in the batch is completed before model update, resulting in GPU underutilization. We present AReaL, a fully asynchronous RL system that completely decouples generation from training. Rollout workers in AReaL continuously generate new outputs without waiting, while training workers update the model whenever a batch of data is collected. AReaL also incorporates a collection of system-level optimizations, leading to substantially higher GPU utilization. To stabilize RL training, AReaL balances the workload of rollout and training workers to control data staleness, and adopts a staleness-enhanced PPO variant to better handle outdated training samples. Extensive experiments on math and code reasoning benchmarks show that AReaL achieves up to 2.57times training speedup compared to the best synchronous systems with the same number of GPUs and matched or even improved final performance. The code of AReaL is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/AReaL/."
