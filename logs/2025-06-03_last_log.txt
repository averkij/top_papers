Text:"5 2 0 2 1 3 ] . [ 1 2 1 5 0 0 . 6 0 5 2 : r Pro3D-Editor: Progressive-Views Perspective for Consistent and Precise 3D Editing YangZheng, Mengqi Huang, Nan Chen, Zhendong Mao{zy849900389,huangmq,chen_nan}@mail.ustc.edu.cn, {zdmao}@ustc.edu.cnText-guided 3D editing aims to precisely edit semantically relevant local 3D regions, which has significant potential for various practical applications ranging from 3D games to film production. Existing methods typically follow viewindiscriminate paradigm: editing 2D views indiscriminately and projecting them back into 3D space. However, they overlook the different cross-view interdependencies, resulting in inconsistent multi-view editing. In this study, we argue that ideal consistent 3D editing can be achieved through progressive-views paradigm, which propagates editing semantics from the editing-salient view to other editingsparse views. Specifically, we propose Pro3D-Editor, novel framework, which mainly includes Primary-view Sampler, Key-view Render, and Full-view Refiner. Primary-view Sampler dynamically samples and edits the most editing-salient view as the primary view. Key-view Render accurately propagates editing semantics from the primary view to other key views through its Mixture-of-View-Experts Low-Rank Adaption (MoVE-LoRA). Full-view Refiner edits and refines the 3D object based on the edited multi-views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in editing accuracy and spatial consistency. Project Page: https://shuoyueli4519.github.io/Pro3D-Editor.Text-guided 3D editing [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] aims to precisely edit specific local features of given 3D object based on the text guidance while preserving all other text-irrelevant features. Recently, this task has attracted significant attention as it facilitates diverse and personalized 3D asset synthesis, bringing various practical applications ranging from 3D games to film production. Unlike the wellstudied 2D editing [7, 8, 9], text-guided 3D editing presents greater challenges as it demands comprehensive understanding of real-world 3D structures to achieve both inter-view consistency (i.e., ensuring coherent appearance across views) and intra-view discrimination (i.e., enabling distinctive and view-specific edits for each view). Existing methods focus on lifting editing semantics from the 2D image plane to the 3D spatial space, which can be categorized into two streams, i.e., the iterative single-view stream and the parallel multi-views stream. The former stream [1, 10, 2] iteratively refines the 3D representation by leveraging gradients from individual view images until the 3D object is well-aligned with the textual guidance, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). For example, Vox-E [10] uses pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to obtain each views gradients and then repeatedly update the 3D object. The latter stream [3, 4, 5, 6] simultaneously edits multiple rendered images from fixed viewpoints and subsequently propagates these modifications onto the 3D object, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). For example, PrEditor3D [5] employs prompt-to-prompt image editing to modify rendered multi-view images from fixed viewpoints, and then update the 3D objects. In summary, the commonality of both streams is that they are view-indiscriminate, i.e., each view of the 3D object is edited indiscriminately. Preprint. Under review. Figure 1: We propose novel editing paradigm (top) for text-guided 3D editing. Compared with existing paradigms, it achieves spatial consistency in edited regions (d) and mitigates feature conflicts across views (e). Moreover, our paradigm enables more precise local 3D editing. However, the existing view-indiscriminate paradigm overlooks the different cross-view interdependencies induced by different editing instructions and therefore leads to view-conflicts, resulting in inconsistent 3D editing. Naturally, each view of the 3D object shows different editing salience depending on the editing instruction. For instance, "adding glasses" to 3D character primarily affects its frontal view with minimal impact on its rear one, while "adding ponytail" conversely. Therefore, the cross-view interdependence manifests as the editing interdependence across views, where an "editing-salient" view is more effective in guiding an "editing-sparse" one, while the reverse can only provide insufficient guidance and therefore lead to view-conflicts. As shown in Fig. 1(d), the existing iterative single-view stream indiscriminately samples random view to edit at each step, disregarding its editing salience, result in view-conflicts where both the front and back views erroneously display cat face (highlighted by the red bounding box). Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 1(e), the existing parallel multi-view stream indiscriminately samples several fixed views and edits each indiscriminately, ignoring the varying semantic salience of different views with respect to the editing instruction, thereby leading to conflicts among these edited views, such as pizza appearing in the frontal view but disappearing its rear one (highlighted by the red bounding box). To address these challenges, we propose novel progressive-views paradigm, which progressively samples and edits views from editing salient to sparse, enabling consistent and smooth editing process for arbitrary 3D objects and editing instructions. Compared with the iterative single-view stream, our paradigm edits views in descending order of salience, avoiding the conflicts caused by random view sampling (highlighted by the blue bounding box in Fig. 1(d)). Compared with the parallel multi-view stream, our paradigm first edits the salient views and then uses them to guide further sparse view editing, avoiding the conflicts caused by indiscriminately editing multiple views in parallel (highlighted by the blue bounding box in Fig. 1 (e)). Technically, we propose novel progressive 3D editing framework termed Pro3D-Editor, which constructs hierarchical "primary-view key-views full-views" editing pipeline based on the dynamic editing salience across different views. Specifically, the Pro3D-Editor consists of three successive modules: (1) Primary-view Sampler module dynamically samples and edits the most editing salient view as the primary view by calculating the salience score between each view and the editing signal, which is further linearly extrapolated with its corresponding negative view to amplify accuracy. (2) Key-view Render m"

SmolVLA is a compact, efficient vision-language-action model that achieves competitive performance at reduced computational costs and can be deployed on consumer-grade hardware.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-language models (VLMs) pretrained on large-scale multimodal datasets encode rich visual and linguistic knowledge, making them a strong foundation for robotics. Rather than training robotic policies from scratch, recent approaches adapt VLMs into vision-language-action (VLA) models that enable natural language-driven perception and control. However, existing VLAs are typically massive--often with billions of parameters--leading to high training costs and limited real-world deployability. Moreover, they rely on academic and industrial datasets, overlooking the growing availability of community-collected data from affordable robotic platforms. In this work, we present SmolVLA, a small, efficient, and community-driven VLA that drastically reduces both training and inference costs, while retaining competitive performance. SmolVLA is designed to be trained on a single GPU and deployed on consumer-grade GPUs or even CPUs. To further improve responsiveness, we introduce an asynchronous inference stack decoupling perception and action prediction from action execution, allowing higher control rates with chunked action generation. Despite its compact size, SmolVLA achieves performance comparable to VLAs that are 10x larger. We evaluate SmolVLA on a range of both simulated as well as real-world robotic benchmarks and release all code, pretrained models, and training data.

A progressive-views paradigm with Pro3D-Editor achieves consistent 3D editing by propagating semantics from key views to less edited ones.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-guided 3D editing aims to precisely edit semantically relevant local 3D regions, which has significant potential for various practical applications ranging from 3D games to film production. Existing methods typically follow a view-indiscriminate paradigm: editing 2D views indiscriminately and projecting them back into 3D space. However, they overlook the different cross-view interdependencies, resulting in inconsistent multi-view editing. In this study, we argue that ideal consistent 3D editing can be achieved through a progressive-views paradigm, which propagates editing semantics from the editing-salient view to other editing-sparse views. Specifically, we propose Pro3D-Editor, a novel framework, which mainly includes Primary-view Sampler, Key-view Render, and Full-view Refiner. Primary-view Sampler dynamically samples and edits the most editing-salient view as the primary view. Key-view Render accurately propagates editing semantics from the primary view to other key views through its Mixture-of-View-Experts Low-Rank Adaption (MoVE-LoRA). Full-view Refiner edits and refines the 3D object based on the edited multi-views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in editing accuracy and spatial consistency.

Token entropy patterns are crucial in RLVR, with high-entropy tokens significantly impacting reasoning performance and model optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e., forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20 rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71 on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models, highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the 80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to further improve LLM reasoning.
