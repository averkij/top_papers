Text:"LIFT the Veil for the Truth: Principal Weights Emerge after Rank Reduction for Reasoning-Focused Supervised Fine-Tuning Zihang Liu 1 Tianyu Pang 2 Oleg Balabanov 1 3 4 Chaoqun Yang 5 Tianjin Huang 6 7 Lu Yin 8 7 Yaoqing Yang 2 Shiwei Liu1. Introduction 5 2 0 2 1 ] . [ 1 2 7 7 0 0 . 6 0 5 2 : r Recent studies have shown that supervised finetuning of LLMs on small number of high-quality datasets can yield strong reasoning capabilities. However, full fine-tuning (Full FT), while powerful, is computationally expensive and susceptible to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, particularly when data is limited. Sparse fine-tuning, which previously achieved notable success by updating only small subset of model parameters, offers promising trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Yet, it has lagged behind in the LLM era due to the difficulty of identifying parameters truly critical for reasoning. In this work, we state that weights with the largest magnitude after low-rank approximation are critical weights for fine-tuning, which we call Principal Weights. Surprisingly, while magnitude-based sparse finetuning performs poorly as baseline on LLM fine-tuning, it becomes highly effective after rank reduction. These insights motivate our method: Low-rank Informed Sparse Fine-Tuning (LIFT). LIFT only updates the top 5% Principal Weights throughout training and consistently achieves better performance on reasoning tasks than Full FT, while maintaining memory efficiency on par with popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. In addition to strong performance on target domains such as arithmetic reasoning, LIFT also retains up to 20% more source-domain knowledge, compared to Full FT and LoRA. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zihanghliu/LIFT. 1University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA 2Dartmouth College, NH, USA 3International Computer Science Institute, CA, USA 4Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, CA, USA 5Tsinghua University, China 6University of Exeter, Exeter, UK 7Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands 8University of Surrey, Guildford, UK 9University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.

PMLR 267, 2025. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 Large language models have recently undergone revolutionary advancement in reasoning capabilities through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) (Ye et al., 2025; Muennighoff et al., 2025) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Guo et al., 2025; Face, 2025). Performing SFT on small, high-quality dataset delivers remarkable reasoning performance on math problems (Muennighoff et al., 2025). However, Full Fine-Tuning (Full FT) is prone to overfitting on limited training data (Chu et al., 2025) and incurs substantial computational costs due to the massive sizes of modern LLMs (Yin et al., 2023). On the other hand, Sparse Fine-Tuning (Sparse FT) (Guo et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021; Sung et al., 2021; Sanh et al., 2020a), standout approach for pre-LLM fine-tuning, has demonstrated promising performance by training only small subset of the base models parameters. However, the adoption of Sparse FT has significantly lagged behind its low-rank counterparts in LLMs, as it struggles to identify parameters truly critical to fine-tuning, and its memory overhead is the same as Full FT with irregular sparse patterns. In this paper, we propose Low-rank Informed Sparse FineTuning (LIFT), an effective and efficient approach for reasoning-focused LLM fine-tuning. LIFT builds on counter-intuitive finding: the most naive baseline for Sparse FT, i.e., magnitude-based fine-tuning, becomes remarkably effective after applying low-rank approximation. We hence identify the weights with the largest magnitude after rank reduction as Principal Weights. The process of obtaining Principal Weights is illustrated in Figure 1. Empirical results show that LIFT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods, Sparse FT methods, and Full FT on wide range of tasks. LIFT solves the challenges of Sparse FT in these ways: Prior Knowledge: LIFT identifies Principal Weights, which are critical for retaining pre-training knowledge and adapting to downstream tasks. The intuition aligns with recent findings that reasoning capacity is already in base models (Ye et al., 2025; Yue et al., 2025). LIFT further finds that this knowledge is encoded with Principal Weights and fine-tuning only these parameters is sufficient to achieve comparableor even superiorreasoning performance. Principal Weights Emerge after Rank Reduction for Reasoning-Focused Supervised Fine-Tuning Figure 1: Overview of LIFT. LIFT first performs SVD on the original weight matrix to obtain Rank-r approximation . It then selects the top-K parameters of with the highest magnitudes to create fine-tuning mask. This mask is then applied to the original weight matrix for fine-tuning. Memory Efficiency: LIFT offers significantly better memory efficiency than Full FT and is on par with LoRA. LIFT updates and stores only small subset of parameters during fine-tuning, leading to substantial memory savingsparticularly in optimizer states, which are reduced from 27GB in Full FT to just 1.3GB (<5%) on LLaMA-2-7B. Our analysis reveals that Principal Weights are more important for LLM fine-tuning compared to other weight selection criteria: Adding random perturbation to Principal Weights drastically affects model performance, substantially greater than other sparse selection metrics, both for pre-training knowledge and downstream tasks. In addition, the update matrix of LIFT has substantially larger magnitude than LoRA and Full FT, and substantially larger rank than that of LoRA, close to Full FT, enabling larger capacity to acquire new knowledge in fine-tuning. Furthermore, LIFT can strongly affect the principal eigenspace of the LLM, making significantly larger deviation than LoRA and Full FT, leading to better adaptation of the downstream tasks. We summarize our contributions as follows: We propose LIFT, memory-efficient Sparse Finetuning algorithm, that selects and fine-tunes Principal Weights, as parameters with the highest magnitude after low-rank approximation. LIFT has significantly lower memory overhead than Full FT (less than 5% memory for optimizer), similar to that of LoRA. We show that Principal Weights are crucial for retaining pre-trained knowledge a"

Normalized Attention Guidance (NAG) enhances diffusion models by providing effective negative guidance across regimes and modalities without retraining.  					AI-generated summary 				 Negative guidance -- explicitly suppressing unwanted attributes -- remains a fundamental challenge in diffusion models, particularly in few-step sampling regimes. While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) works well in standard settings, it fails under aggressive sampling step compression due to divergent predictions between positive and negative branches. We present Normalized Attention Guidance (NAG), an efficient, training-free mechanism that applies extrapolation in attention space with L1-based normalization and refinement. NAG restores effective negative guidance where CFG collapses while maintaining fidelity. Unlike existing approaches, NAG generalizes across architectures (UNet, DiT), sampling regimes (few-step, multi-step), and modalities (image, video), functioning as a universal plug-in with minimal computational overhead. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate consistent improvements in text alignment (CLIP Score), fidelity (FID, PFID), and human-perceived quality (ImageReward). Our ablation studies validate each design component, while user studies confirm significant preference for NAG-guided outputs. As a model-agnostic inference-time approach requiring no retraining, NAG provides effortless negative guidance for all modern diffusion frameworks -- pseudocode in the Appendix!

ComposeAnything improves text-to-image generation by using LLMs for 2.5D semantic layouts, enhancing object placement and coherence in diffusion-based models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generating images from text involving complex and novel object arrangements remains a significant challenge for current text-to-image (T2I) models. Although prior layout-based methods improve object arrangements using spatial constraints with 2D layouts, they often struggle to capture 3D positioning and sacrifice quality and coherence. In this work, we introduce ComposeAnything, a novel framework for improving compositional image generation without retraining existing T2I models. Our approach first leverages the chain-of-thought reasoning abilities of LLMs to produce 2.5D semantic layouts from text, consisting of 2D object bounding boxes enriched with depth information and detailed captions. Based on this layout, we generate a spatial and depth aware coarse composite of objects that captures the intended composition, serving as a strong and interpretable prior that replaces stochastic noise initialization in diffusion-based T2I models. This prior guides the denoising process through object prior reinforcement and spatial-controlled denoising, enabling seamless generation of compositional objects and coherent backgrounds, while allowing refinement of inaccurate priors. ComposeAnything outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the T2I-CompBench and NSR-1K benchmarks for prompts with 2D/3D spatial arrangements, high object counts, and surreal compositions. Human evaluations further demonstrate that our model generates high-quality images with compositions that faithfully reflect the text.

WebChoreArena, a new benchmark comprising 532 tasks, extends the scope of WebArena to more complex and tedious web browsing tasks, measuring advancements in LLM capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Powered by a large language model (LLM), a web browsing agent operates web browsers in a human-like manner and offers a highly transparent path toward automating a wide range of everyday tasks. As web agents become increasingly capable and demonstrate proficiency in general browsing tasks, a critical question emerges: Can they go beyond general browsing to robustly handle tasks that are tedious and complex, or chores that humans often avoid doing themselves? In this paper, we introduce WebChoreArena, a new fully reproducible benchmark comprising 532 carefully curated tasks designed to extend the scope of WebArena beyond general browsing to more labor-intensive and tedious tasks. WebChoreArena systematically integrates three key challenges: (i) Massive Memory tasks requiring accurate retrieval of large amounts of information in the observations, (ii) Calculation tasks demanding precise mathematical reasoning, and (iii) Long-Term Memory tasks necessitating long-term memory across multiple webpages. Built on top of the fully reproducible and widely adopted four WebArena simulation environments, WebChoreArena ensures strict reproducibility and enables fair, direct comparisons with the established WebArena benchmark, offering key insights into agent progress. Our experimental results demonstrate that as LLMs evolve, represented by GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, significant improvements in performance are observed on WebChoreArena. These findings suggest that WebChoreArena is well-suited to measure the advancement of state-of-the-art LLMs with greater clarity. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that even with Gemini 2.5 Pro, there remains substantial room for improvement compared to WebArena, highlighting the increased challenges posed by WebChoreArena.

A novel pipeline using GPT-4o-mini generates a large-scale dataset for hate speech detoxification, improving baseline model performance in style accuracy, content preservation, and fluency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Detoxification, the task of rewriting harmful language into non-toxic text, has become increasingly important amid the growing prevalence of toxic content online. However, high-quality parallel datasets for detoxification, especially for hate speech, remain scarce due to the cost and sensitivity of human annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-in-the-loop pipeline leveraging GPT-4o-mini for automated detoxification. We first replicate the ParaDetox pipeline by replacing human annotators with an LLM and show that the LLM performs comparably to human annotation. Building on this, we construct PARADEHATE, a large-scale parallel dataset specifically for hatespeech detoxification. We release PARADEHATE as a benchmark of over 8K hate/non-hate text pairs and evaluate a wide range of baseline methods. Experimental results show that models such as BART, fine-tuned on PARADEHATE, achieve better performance in style accuracy, content preservation, and fluency, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-generated detoxification text as a scalable alternative to human annotation.

"A novel pipeline using GPT-4o-mini generates a large-scale dataset for hate speech detoxification, improving baseline model performance in style accuracy, content preservation, and fluency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Detoxification, the task of rewriting harmful language into non-toxic text, has become increasingly important amid the growing prevalence of toxic content online. However, high-quality parallel datasets for detoxification, especially for hate speech, remain scarce due to the cost and sensitivity of human annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-in-the-loop pipeline leveraging GPT-4o-mini for automated detoxification. We first replicate the ParaDetox pipeline by replacing human annotators with an LLM and show that the LLM performs comparably to human annotation. Building on this, we construct PARADEHATE, a large-scale parallel dataset specifically for hatespeech detoxification. We release PARADEHATE as a benchmark of over 8K hate/non-hate text pairs and evaluate a wide range of baseline methods.

OmniResponse, a Multimodal Large Language Model, generates high-quality synchronized verbal and non-verbal listener responses using text as an intermediate modality.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we introduce Online Multimodal Conversational Response Generation (OMCRG), a novel task that aims to online generate synchronized verbal and non-verbal listener feedback, conditioned on the speaker's multimodal input. OMCRG reflects natural dyadic interactions and poses new challenges in achieving synchronization between the generated audio and facial responses of the listener. To address these challenges, we innovatively introduce text as an intermediate modality to bridge the audio and facial responses. We hence propose OmniResponse, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that autoregressively generates high-quality multi-modal listener responses. OmniResponse leverages a pretrained LLM enhanced with two novel components: Chrono-Text, which temporally anchors generated text tokens, and TempoVoice, a controllable online TTS module that produces speech synchronized with facial reactions. To support further OMCRG research, we present ResponseNet, a new dataset comprising 696 high-quality dyadic interactions featuring synchronized split-screen videos, multichannel audio, transcripts, and facial behavior annotations. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on ResponseNet demonstrate that OmniResponse significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of semantic speech content, audio-visual synchronization, and generation quality.

Leveraging low-rank approximation to identify critical weights for sparse fine-tuning of large language models enhances performance and efficiency compared to full fine-tuning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent studies have shown that supervised fine-tuning of LLMs on a small number of high-quality datasets can yield strong reasoning capabilities. However, full fine-tuning (Full FT), while powerful, is computationally expensive and susceptible to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, particularly when data is limited. Sparse fine-tuning, which previously achieved notable success by updating only a small subset of model parameters, offers a promising trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Yet, it has lagged behind in the LLM era due to the difficulty of identifying parameters truly critical for reasoning. In this work, we state that weights with the largest magnitude after low-rank approximation are critical weights for fine-tuning, which we call Principal Weights. Surprisingly, while magnitude-based sparse fine-tuning performs poorly as a baseline on LLM fine-tuning, it becomes highly effective after rank reduction. These insights motivate our method: Low-rank Informed Sparse Fine-Tuning (LIFT). LIFT only updates the top 5% Principal Weights throughout training and consistently achieves better performance on reasoning tasks than Full FT, while maintaining memory efficiency on par with popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. In addition to strong performance on target domains such as arithmetic reasoning, LIFT also retains up to 20% more source-domain knowledge, compared to Full FT and LoRA.

To address these limitations in LLMs, we present the Arabic Depth Mini Dataset (ADMD), a carefully curated collection of 490 challenging questions spanning ten major domains (42 sub-domains, see Figure 1. Using ADMD, we evaluate five leading language models: GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini Flash 1.5, CommandR 100B, and Qwen-Max. Our results reveal significant variations in model performance across different domains, with particular challenges in areas requiring deep cultural understanding and specialized knowledge. Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrated the highest overall accuracy at 30\%, showing relative strength in mathematical theory in Arabic, Arabic language, and islamic domains. This work provides both theoretical foundations and practical insights for improving Arabic language model evaluation, emphasizing the importance of cultural competence alongside technical capabilities.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in reasoning tasks, yet still struggle with complex problems requiring explicit self-reflection and self-correction, especially compared to their unimodal text-based counterparts. Existing reflection methods are simplistic and struggle to generate meaningful and instructive feedback, as the reasoning ability and knowledge limits of pre-trained models are largely fixed during initial training. To overcome these challenges, we propose Multimodal Self-Reflection enhanced reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (SRPO), a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework explicitly designed to enhance multimodal LLM reasoning. In the first stage, we construct a high-quality, reflection-focused dataset under the guidance of an advanced MLLM, which generates reflections based on initial responses to help the policy model learn both reasoning and self-reflection. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward mechanism within the GRPO framework that encourages concise and cognitively meaningful reflection while avoiding redundancy. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista, MathVision, MathVerse, and MMMU-Pro, using Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and Qwen-2.5-VL-32B demonstrate that SRPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving notable improvements in both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality.

Acquiring large-scale emotional speech data with strong consistency remains a challenge for speech synthesis. This paper presents MIKU-PAL, a fully automated multimodal pipeline for extracting high-consistency emotional speech from unlabeled video data. Leveraging face detection and tracking algorithms, we developed an automatic emotion analysis system using a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our results demonstrate that MIKU-PAL can achieve human-level accuracy (68.5% on MELD) and superior consistency (0.93 Fleiss kappa score) while being much cheaper and faster than human annotation. With the high-quality, flexible, and consistent annotation from MIKU-PAL, we can annotate fine-grained speech emotion categories of up to 26 types, validated by human annotators with 83% rationality ratings. Based on our proposed system, we further released a fine-grained emotional speech dataset MIKU-EmoBench(131.2 hours) as a new benchmark for emotional text-to-speech and visual voice cloning.
