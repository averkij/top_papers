Furthermore, we explore novel strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent robustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving state-ofthe-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our 8B-parameter opensource model surpasses previous leading systems such as WebDancer and WebSailor, establishing new performance standard for accessible, high-capability AI agents. Note: The term Cognitive Kernel (Zhang et al., 2024) refers to the core computational framework of the agent, designed to emulate the cognitive processes of the human mind. Equal Core ContributorsFigure 2: Technical roadmap showcasing prior innovations from Tencent AI Lab (Cognitive Kernel; Zhang et al., 2024, WebVoyager; He et al., 2024a, etc) and their integration to Cognitive KernelPro via three core components, agent framework development, agent data construction, and agent foundation model training. Yellow blocks highlight novel contributions in this work and the corresponding section numbers.The rapid advancement of Deep Research Agents (Monica.Im, 2025; OpenAI, 2025) has transformed the landscape of automated knowledge discovery and problem-solving. These agents, powered by large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), excel in tasks such as coding, web navigation, file processing, and complex reasoning. However, efforts toward fully open-source agent frameworks (Roucher et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025a; Li et al., 2025a) remain limited. Existing open-source implementations (Zhu et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025) often rely on proprietary tools like Jina Reader, FireCrawl, or Chunkr to achieve competitive performance, creating barriers to accessibility and reproducibility, or lack of multimodal or general agentic abilities (Wu et al., 2025a; Li et al., 2025a). This dependency on paid tools underscores the need for robust, fully opensource framework that maximizes the inherent capabilities of LLMs and VLMs without external dependencies. To address this gap, we propose Cognitive Kernel-Pro, multi-module, hierarchical agent framework designed to facilitate fully open-source agent development. Cognitive Kernel-Pro leverages Python code as its action space, harnessing the full reasoning and code-generation potential of modern LLMs. The framework adopts modular architecture, featuring main agent that orchestrates specialized sub-agents for web navigation, file handling, and tool invocation. Each module operates independently, ensuring modularity and extensibility while simplifying the collection of task-specific training data. By minimizing reliance on proprietary tools, Cognitive Kernel-Pro emphasizes the intrinsic capabilities of Agent Foundation Models. In addition to the framework, we introduce comprehensive training recipe tailored for Cognitive Kernel-Pro, covering diverse domains such as web navigation, file processing, code generation, and reasoning. Our approach includes the construction of verifiable agent query-answer pairs, ensuring high-quality training data. To enhance data collection, we incorporate intermediate process hints and employ hint-based rejection sampling, which significantly improves the quality and relevance of the collected data. This structured training methodology enables Cognitive Kernel-Pro to achieve robust performance across diverse tasks while maintaining full open-source compatibility."

"Cognitive Kernel-Pro is an open-source multi-module agent framework that enhances AI agent robustness and performance through data curation and novel test-time strategies, achieving state-of-the-art results.  					AI-generated summary 				 General AI Agents are increasingly recognized as foundational frameworks for the next generation of artificial intelligence, enabling complex reasoning, web interaction, coding, and autonomous research capabilities. However, current agent systems are either closed-source or heavily reliant on a variety of paid APIs and proprietary tools, limiting accessibility and reproducibility for the research community. In this work, we present Cognitive Kernel-Pro, a fully open-source and (to the maximum extent) free multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. Within Cognitive Kernel-Pro, we systematically investigate the curation of high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the construction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key domains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent robustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our 8B-parameter open-source model surpasses previous leading systems such as WebDancer and WebSailor, establishing a new performance standard for accessible, high-capability AI agents. Code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/CognitiveKernel-Pro"

MCIF is a multilingual, human-annotated benchmark for evaluating instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings using scientific talks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human annotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech, vision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open research and progress in MLLMs development.
