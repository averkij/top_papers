Text:"3D-R1: Enhancing Reasoning in 3D VLMs for Unified Scene Understanding Ting Huang1 Zeyu Zhang2 Hao Tang2 1Shanghai University of Engineering Science 2School of Computer Science, Peking University Equal contribution. Project lead. Corresponding author: bjdxtanghao@gmail.com. 5 2 0 J 1 3 ] . [ 1 8 7 4 3 2 . 7 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: 3D-R1 is an open-source generalist model that enhances the reasoning of 3D VLMs for unified scene understanding. Abstract Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we propose 3D-R1, foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of 3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct high-quality synthetic dataset with CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and data engine based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1. Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward functions: perception reward, semantic similarity reward and format reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision. Furthermore, we introduce dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10% across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding.

LLMs generate fewer hallucinations in Mandarin compared to Hindi and Farsi across multiple models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating text that closely resemble human writing. However, they often generate factually incorrect statements, a problem typically referred to as 'hallucination'. Addressing hallucination is crucial for enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs. While much research has focused on hallucinations in English, our study extends this investigation to conversational data in three languages: Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin. We offer a comprehensive analysis of a dataset to examine both factual and linguistic errors in these languages for GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0, DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3. We found that LLMs produce very few hallucinated responses in Mandarin but generate a significantly higher number of hallucinations in Hindi and Farsi.

"3D-R1 enhances 3D scene understanding through a high-quality synthetic dataset, reinforcement learning with GRPO, and dynamic view selection, achieving significant improvements in reasoning and generalization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of 3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1. Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10% across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding.
