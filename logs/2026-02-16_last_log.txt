ZwZ-4B/7B/8B demonstrate competitive performance compared with current SOTA MLLMs (e.g., Gemini-3-Flash, Kimi-K2.5, Qwen3-VL-235B). Abstract Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent Thinking-with-Images methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this regiongrounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves single-glance fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with dual-view protocol that quantifies the globalregional zooming gap. Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks (Figure 1), and also improve general multimodal cognition on ben"

Text:"MedXIAOHE: Comprehensive Recipe for Building Medical MLLMsSee Contributions section for full author list.We present MedXIAOHE, medical vision-language foundation model designed to advance generalpurpose medical understanding and reasoning in real-world clinical applications. MedXIAOHE achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse medical benchmarks and surpasses leading closed-source multimodal systems on multiple capabilities. To achieve this, we propose an entityaware continual pretraining framework that organizes heterogeneous medical corpora to broaden knowledge coverage and reduce long-tail gaps (e.g., rare diseases). For medical expert-level reasoning and interaction, MedXIAOHE incorporates diverse medical reasoning patterns via reinforcement learning and tool-augmented agentic training, enabling multi-step diagnostic reasoning with verifiable decision traces. To improve reliability in real-world use, MedXIAOHE integrates user-preference rubrics, evidence-grounded reasoning, and low-hallucination long-form report generation, with improved adherence to medical instructions. We release this report to document our practical design choices, scaling insights, and evaluation framework, hoping to inspire further research.

Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, compression problem (Sutskever, 2023). Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs. Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OneVision-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs shared 3D RoPE and is trained with large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics. Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not trade-off; they are positively correlated. By resolving the dichotomy between dense grids and sparse semantics, OV-Encoder redefines the performance frontier. When integrated into large multimodal models, it consistently outperforms strong vision backbones such as Qwen3-ViT and SigLIP2 across 16 image, video, and document understanding benchmarks, despite using substantially fewer visual tokens and pretraining data.

Frankenstein-Style Analysis Xirui Li1,, Ming Li1,, Tianyi Zhou2 1University of Maryland, 2Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence Co-first Author Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has become standard post-training stage for boosting visual reasoning in vision-language models, yet it remains unclear what capabilities RL actually improves compared with supervised fine-tuning as cold-start initialization (IN). End-to-end benchmark gains conflate multiple factors, making it difficult to attribute improvements to specific skills. To bridge the gap, we propose Frankenstein-style analysis framework, including: (i) functional localization via causal probing; (ii) update characterization via parameter comparison; and (iii) transferability test via model merging. Instead, RL induces consistent inference-time shift primarily in mid-to-late layers, and these mid-to-late refinements are both transferable (via merging) and necessary (via freezing) for RL gains. Overall, our results suggest that RLs reliable contribution in visual reasoning is not uniform enhancement of visual perception, but systematic refinement of mid-to-late transformer computation that improves vision-to-reasoning alignment and reasoning performance, highlighting the limitations of benchmark-only evaluation for understanding multimodal reasoning improvements.

Text:"2026-02-12 Intelligent AI Delegation Nenad Tomašev1, Matija Franklin1 and Simon Osindero1 1Google DeepMind 6 2 0 2 2 1 ] . [ 1 5 6 8 1 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks. To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation - sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties. The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web. Keywords: AI, agents, LLM, delegation, multi-agent, safety 1. Introduction heuristic multi-agent frameworks. As advanced AI agents evolve beyond queryresponse models, their utility is increasingly defined by how effectively they can decompose complex objectives and delegate sub-tasks. This coordination paradigm underpins applications ranging from personal use, where AI agents can act as personal assistants (Gabriel et al., 2024), to commercial, enterprise deployments where AI agents can provide support and automate workflows (Huang and Hughes, 2025; Shao et al., 2025; Tupe and Thube, 2025).

Text:"ABot-M0: VLA Foundation Model for Robotic Manipulation with Action Manifold LearningSee Contributions section for full author list.Building general-purpose embodied agents across diverse hardware remains central challenge in robotics, often framed as the one-brain, many-forms paradigm. Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, framework that builds systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pretraining improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning. Experiments show components operate independently with additive benefits. We will release all code and pipelines for reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Universal video understanding requires modeling fine-grained visual and audio information over time in diverse real-world scenarios. However, the performance of existing models is primarily constrained by videoinstruction data that represents complex audiovisual content as single, incomplete descriptions, lacking fine-grained organization and reliable annotation. To address this, we introduce: (i) ASID-1M, an open-source collection of one million structured, fine-grained audiovisual instruction annotations with singleand multi-attribute supervision; (ii) ASID-Verify, scalable data curation pipeline for annotation, with automatic verification and refinement that enforces semantic and temporal consistency between descriptions and the corresponding audiovisual content; and (iii) ASID-Captioner, video understanding model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the ASID-1M. Experiments across seven benchmarks covering audiovisual captioning, attribute-wise captioning, caption-based QA, and caption-based temporal grounding show that ASID-Captioner improves fine-grained caption quality while reducing hallucinations and improving instruction following. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models and is competitive with Gemini-3-Pro.

These results underscore the promising potential of next-generation autonomous scientific agents. The code and data are released in https://github.com/CMarsRover/SciAgentGYM. 1. Introduction Modern scientific reasoning increasingly relies on tool-assisted workflows, from molecular simulations to large-scale data analysis [23, 21]. Solving these scientific problems necessitates the deployment of tools, as solutions rarely emerge from direct inference but rather through extensive trial-anderror, where LLM agents must iteratively test hypotheses and refine strategies based on execution feedback [20]. For instance, as illustrated in Figure 1, an agent invokes chemistry tools for ligand selection, encounters an error, and recovers before producing the final answer. This marks paradigm shift for LLM agents from relying on internal parameterized knowledge toward reasoning through dynamic interaction and execution-based feedback. Despite this evolving requirement, existing scientific benchmarks predominantly target static question answering and fail to capture the interactive, tool-mediated nature of actual scientific workflows [12, 22]. Meanwhile, general tool-use evaluations rarely reflect the breadth of domainspecific scientific tools [27, 11]. With the surging interest in developing capable scientific agents [4], there is an urgent need for an evaluation framework that mirrors real-world scientific reasoning, where progress emerges through multi-turn, adaptive tool execution and iterative refinement. To bridge this gap, we introduce SciAgentGym (3), hierarchical interactive environment designed for grounding LLM agents in multi-turn tool-use scientific reasoning tasks.

Complementing the environment is SciAgentBench (4), rigorous evaluation suite constructed to quantify the gap between tool availability and tool mastery. Spanning 259 tasks and 1,134 sub-questions, the benchmark scales from elementary actions (L1) to highfidelity, long-horizon workflows (L3). This tiered structure enables us to isolate exactly where agents struggle in complex scientific problem-solving. Our comprehensive evaluation confirms that while tool-augmented agents outperform pure reasoning approaches, long-horizon scientific tool-use remains distinct bottleneck. Notably, even GPT-5 achieves only 41.3% overall success rate, with performance dropping sharply from 60.6% to 30.9% as interaction horizons increase. Fine-grained analysis reveals the root cause: weaker models frequently fall into persistent redundant tool calls, whereas stronger models manage to recover from initial errors, reflecting better adaptation under execution feedback. Current models lack fundamental understanding of the logical dependencies between scientific tools. Without explicit structural guidance, they fail to navigate the vast tool space of potential actions. Figure 1 Benchmarking multi-step scientific tooluse in SciAgentGym. representative trajectory where an LLM agent interacts with the environment to solve complex chemistry task. This example illustrates the core agent capabilities demonstrated within our environment: orchestrating domainspecific tools, recovering from errors, and synthesizing final outputs. Recognizing that standard training data lacks complex dependencies across diverse scientific tools, we design SciForge (5), data synthesis method that formalizes the tool environment from flat collection into dependency graph. By systematically sampling valid execution paths and synthesizing questions grounded in verified runtime traces, SciForge generates logic-aware training data. Fine-tuning on these trajectories enables our SciAgent-8B to gain +6.7%, outperforming the Qwen3-VL-235B-Instruct [29], while SciAgent-4B improves by +5.5%. These results demonstrate that scientific tool-use capabilities scale efficiently and exhibit positive cross-domain transfer. Our key contributions are summarized as follows: SciAgentGym: An extensible environment integrating 1,780 domain-specific tools across four scientific disciplines to ground agents in multi-turn reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents GeoAgent, model capable of reasoning closely with humans and deriving fine-grained address conclusions. Previous RL-based methods have achieved breakthroughs in performance and interpretability but still remain concerns because of their reliance on AI-generated chain-of-thought (CoT) data and training strategies, which conflict with geographic characteristics. To address these issues, we first introduce GeoSeek, new geolocation dataset comprising CoT data annotated by geographic experts and professional players. We further thoroughly explore the inherent characteristics of geographic tasks and propose geo-similarity reward and consistency reward assessed by consistency agent to assist training. This encourages the model to converge towards correct answers from geographic perspective while ensuring the integrity and consistency of its reasoning process. Experimental results show that GeoAgent outperforms existing methods and series of general VLLMs across multiple grains, while generating reasoning that closely aligns with humans.

While RL-tuned VLMs improve on visual reasoning benchmarks, they remain vulnerable to weak visual grounding, hallucinations, and over-reliance on textual cues. We show that simple, controlled textual perturbationsmisleading captions or incorrect chain-of-thought (CoT) tracescause substantial drops in robustness and confidence, and that these effects are more pronounced when CoT consistency is taken into account across open-source multimodal reasoning models. Entropy-based metrics further show that these perturbations reshape model uncertainty and probability mass on the correct option, exposing modelspecific trends in miscalibration. To better understand these vulnerabilities, we further analyze RL fine-tuning dynamics and uncover an accuracyfaithfulness trade-off: fine-tuning raises benchmark accuracy, but can simultaneously erode the reliability of the accompanying CoT and its robustness to contextual shifts. Although adversarial augmentation improves robustness, it does not by itself prevent faithfulness drift. Incorporating faithfulness-aware reward can restore alignment between answers and reasoning, but when paired with augmentation, training risks collapsing onto shortcut strategies and robustness remains elusive. Together, these findings highlight the limitations of accuracy-only evaluations and motivate training and assessment protocols that jointly emphasize correctness, robustness, and the faithfulness of visually grounded reasoning.

Our framework robustly handles extreme viewpoint changes and diverse lighting conditions while maintaining strict geometric-illumination consistency. Abstract Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have established new paradigm for image and video relighting. However, extending these capabilities to 4D relighting remains challenging, due primarily to the scarcity of paired 4D relighting training data and the difficulty of maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints. In this work, we propose Light4D, novel training-free framework designed to synthesize consistent 4D videos under target illumination, even under extreme viewpoint changes. First, we introduce Disentangled Flow Guidance, time-aware strategy that effectively injects lighting control into the latent space while preserving geometric integrity. Second, to reinforce temporal consistency, we develop Temporal Consistent Attention within the IC-Light architecture and further incorporate deterministic regularization to eliminate appearance flickering.

Text:"GeneralVLA: Generalizable VisionLanguageAction Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning Guoqing Ma1 Siheng Wang2 Zeyu Zhang2 Shan Yu1 Hao Tang2 1CASIA 2Peking University Equal contribution. Project lead. Corresponding author: bjdxtanghao@gmail.com. 6 2 0 2 4 ] . [ 1 5 1 3 4 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r AbstractLarge foundation models have shown strong openworld generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is that the models exhibit limited zero-shot capability, which hampers their ability to generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable VisionLanguageAction Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-theart methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA"

Region-to-Image Distillation enables fine-grained visual perception in MLLMs by training models to internally perform iterative zooming during inference, eliminating the need for repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding while maintaining high performance across multiple benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass. Our code is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/Zooming-without-Zooming.

MedXIAOHE achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse medical benchmarks and surpasses leading closed-source multimodal systems on multiple capabilities. To achieve this, we propose an entity-aware continual pretraining framework that organizes heterogeneous medical corpora to broaden knowledge coverage and reduce long-tail gaps (e.g., rare diseases). For medical expert-level reasoning and interaction, MedXIAOHE incorporates diverse medical reasoning patterns via reinforcement learning and tool-augmented agentic training, enabling multi-step diagnostic reasoning with verifiable decision traces. To improve reliability in real-world use, MedXIAOHE integrates user-preference rubrics, evidence-grounded reasoning, and low-hallucination long-form report generation, with improved adherence to medical instructions. We release this report to document our practical design choices, scaling insights, and evaluation framework, hoping to inspire further research."

Visual understanding can be improved by aligning architectures with information-theoretic principles of video compression, using sparsity-driven encoding that outperforms traditional approaches in efficiency and accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Hypothesis. Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, a compression problem. Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs.   Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OV-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs a shared 3D RoPE and is trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics.   Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not a trade-off; they are positively correlated. When integrated into LLM, it consistently outperforms strong vision backbones such as Qwen3-ViT and SigLIP2 across 16 image, video, and document understanding benchmarks, despite using substantially fewer visual tokens and pretraining data. Notably, on video understanding tasks, OV-Encoder achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over Qwen3-ViT. Codec-aligned, patch-level sparsity is a foundational principle, enabling OV-Encoder as a scalable engine for next-generation visual generalists.

Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has become a standard post-training stage for boosting visual reasoning in vision-language models, yet it remains unclear what capabilities RL actually improves compared with supervised fine-tuning as cold-start initialization (IN). End-to-end benchmark gains conflate multiple factors, making it difficult to attribute improvements to specific skills. To bridge the gap, we propose a Frankenstein-style analysis framework including: (i) functional localization via causal probing; (ii) update characterization via parameter comparison; and (iii) transferability test via model merging. Instead, RL induces a consistent inference-time shift primarily in mid-to-late layers, and these mid-to-late refinements are both transferable (via merging) and necessary (via freezing) for RL gains. Overall, our results suggest that RL's reliable contribution in visual reasoning is not a uniform enhancement of visual perception, but a systematic refinement of mid-to-late transformer computation that improves vision-to-reasoning alignment and reasoning performance, highlighting the limitations of benchmark-only evaluation for understanding multimodal reasoning improvements.

AI agents require adaptive frameworks for task decomposition and delegation that can dynamically respond to environmental changes and handle unexpected failures through structured authority transfer and trust mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks. To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties. The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.

ABot-M0 presents a unified framework for embodied agent development that standardizes diverse robotic data and employs action manifold learning to improve prediction efficiency and stability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Building general-purpose embodied agents across diverse hardware remains a central challenge in robotics, often framed as the ''one-brain, many-forms'' paradigm. Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, a framework that builds a systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning. Experiments show components operate independently with additive benefits. We will release all code and pipelines for reproducibility and future research.

A large-scale dataset and model for fine-grained audiovisual understanding are introduced, demonstrating improved caption quality and reduced hallucinations through structured annotations and supervised fine-tuning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Universal video understanding requires modeling fine-grained visual and audio information over time in diverse real-world scenarios. However, the performance of existing models is primarily constrained by video-instruction data that represents complex audiovisual content as single, incomplete descriptions, lacking fine-grained organization and reliable annotation. To address this, we introduce: (i) ASID-1M, an open-source collection of one million structured, fine-grained audiovisual instruction annotations with single- and multi-attribute supervision; (ii) ASID-Verify, a scalable data curation pipeline for annotation, with automatic verification and refinement that enforces semantic and temporal consistency between descriptions and the corresponding audiovisual content; and (iii) ASID-Captioner, a video understanding model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the ASID-1M. Experiments across seven benchmarks covering audiovisual captioning, attribute-wise captioning, caption-based QA, and caption-based temporal grounding show that ASID-Captioner improves fine-grained caption quality while reducing hallucinations and improving instruction following. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models and is competitive with Gemini-3-Pro.

SciAgentGym and SciAgentBench enable evaluation of scientific tool-use capabilities, while SciForge improves agent performance through dependency graph modeling of tool interactions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Scientific reasoning inherently demands integrating sophisticated toolkits to navigate domain-specific knowledge. Yet, current benchmarks largely overlook agents' ability to orchestrate tools for such rigorous workflows. To bridge this gap, we introduce SciAgentGym, a scalable interactive environment featuring 1,780 domain-specific tools across four natural science disciplines, supported by a robust execution infrastructure. Complementing this, we present SciAgentBench, a tiered evaluation suite designed to stress-test agentic capabilities from elementary actions to long-horizon workflows. Our evaluation identifies a critical bottleneck: state-of-the-art models struggle with complex scientific tool-use. Even for a leading model like GPT-5, success rates drop sharply from 60.6% to 30.9% as interaction horizons extend, primarily due to failures in multi-step workflow execution. To address this, we propose SciForge, a data synthesis method that models the tool action space as a dependency graph to generate logic-aware training trajectories. By fine-tuning on these trajectories, our SciAgent-8B outperforms the significantly larger Qwen3-VL-235B-Instruct while exhibiting positive cross-domain transfer of scientific tool-use capabilities. These results underscore the promising potential of next-generation autonomous scientific agents.

Авторы выявили критическую проблему: современные большие модели резко теряют эффективность при выполнении многошаговых научных рабочих процессов, особенно когда горизонт взаимодействия расширяется. Для решения этой проблемы предложен метод SciForge, который моделирует пространство действий инструментов как граф зависимостей для генерации логически обоснованных обучающих траекторий.

Field Least-Energy Actor-Critic (FLAC) addresses challenges in maximum entropy reinforcement learning with iterative generative policies by using kinetic energy as a proxy for policy stochasticity regulation through a generalized Schrödinger bridge formulation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Iterative generative policies, such as diffusion models and flow matching, offer superior expressivity for continuous control but complicate Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning because their action log-densities are not directly accessible. To address this, we propose Field Least-Energy Actor-Critic (FLAC), a likelihood-free framework that regulates policy stochasticity by penalizing the kinetic energy of the velocity field. Our key insight is to formulate policy optimization as a Generalized Schrödinger Bridge (GSB) problem relative to a high-entropy reference process (e.g., uniform). Under this view, the maximum-entropy principle emerges naturally as staying close to a high-entropy reference while optimizing return, without requiring explicit action densities. In this framework, kinetic energy serves as a physically grounded proxy for divergence from the reference: minimizing path-space energy bounds the deviation of the induced terminal action distribution. Building on this view, we derive an energy-regularized policy iteration scheme and a practical off-policy algorithm that automatically tunes the kinetic energy via a Lagrangian dual mechanism. Empirically, FLAC achieves superior or comparable performance on high-dimensional benchmarks relative to strong baselines, while avoiding explicit density estimation.

A vision-language-action model for robotics combines large-scale pretraining with specialized training techniques to enable real-time execution and high-performance manipulation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this report, we introduce Xiaomi-Robotics-0, an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model optimized for high performance and fast and smooth real-time execution. The key to our method lies in a carefully designed training recipe and deployment strategy. Xiaomi-Robotics-0 is first pre-trained on large-scale cross-embodiment robot trajectories and vision-language data, endowing it with broad and generalizable action-generation capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the visual-semantic knowledge of the underlying pre-trained VLM. During post-training, we propose several techniques for training the VLA model for asynchronous execution to address the inference latency during real-robot rollouts. During deployment, we carefully align the timesteps of consecutive predicted action chunks to ensure continuous and seamless real-time rollouts. We evaluate Xiaomi-Robotics-0 extensively in simulation benchmarks and on two challenging real-robot tasks that require precise and dexterous bimanual manipulation. Results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all simulation benchmarks. Moreover, Xiaomi-Robotics-0 can roll out fast and smoothly on real robots using a consumer-grade GPU, achieving high success rates and throughput on both real-robot tasks. To facilitate future research, code and model checkpoints are open-sourced at https://xiaomi-robotics-0.github.io

GeoAgent achieves superior geolocation reasoning performance through a specialized dataset and reward mechanisms that ensure geographic accuracy and reasoning consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents GeoAgent, a model capable of reasoning closely with humans and deriving fine-grained address conclusions. Previous RL-based methods have achieved breakthroughs in performance and interpretability but still remain concerns because of their reliance on AI-generated chain-of-thought (CoT) data and training strategies, which conflict with geographic characteristics. To address these issues, we first introduce GeoSeek, a new geolocation dataset comprising CoT data annotated by geographic experts and professional players. We further thoroughly explore the inherent characteristics of geographic tasks and propose a geo-similarity reward and a consistency reward assessed by a consistency agent to assist training. This encourages the model to converge towards correct answers from a geographic perspective while ensuring the integrity and consistency of its reasoning process. Experimental results show that GeoAgent outperforms existing methods and a series of general VLLMs across multiple grains, while generating reasoning that closely aligns with humans.

Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning has become a key technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks, motivating its extension to vision language models (VLMs). While RL-tuned VLMs improve on visual reasoning benchmarks, they remain vulnerable to weak visual grounding, hallucinations, and over-reliance on textual cues. We show that simple, controlled textual perturbations--misleading captions or incorrect chain-of-thought (CoT) traces--cause substantial drops in robustness and confidence, and that these effects are more pronounced when CoT consistency is taken into account across open-source multimodal reasoning models. Entropy-based metrics further show that these perturbations reshape model uncertainty and probability mass on the correct option, exposing model-specific trends in miscalibration. To better understand these vulnerabilities, we further analyze RL fine-tuning dynamics and uncover an accuracy-faithfulness trade-off: fine-tuning raises benchmark accuracy, but can simultaneously erode the reliability of the accompanying CoT and its robustness to contextual shifts. Although adversarial augmentation improves robustness, it does not by itself prevent faithfulness drift. Incorporating a faithfulness-aware reward can restore alignment between answers and reasoning, but when paired with augmentation, training risks collapsing onto shortcut strategies and robustness remains elusive. Together, these findings highlight the limitations of accuracy-only evaluations and motivate training and assessment protocols that jointly emphasize correctness, robustness, and the faithfulness of visually grounded reasoning.

Research reveals that specific attention layers in audio diffusion models control distinct musical concepts, enabling precise manipulation of audio features through activation steering.  					AI-generated summary 				 Audio diffusion models can synthesize high-fidelity music from text, yet their internal mechanisms for representing high-level concepts remain poorly understood. In this work, we use activation patching to demonstrate that distinct semantic musical concepts, such as the presence of specific instruments, vocals, or genre characteristics, are controlled by a small, shared subset of attention layers in state-of-the-art audio diffusion architectures. Next, we demonstrate that applying Contrastive Activation Addition and Sparse Autoencoders in these layers enables more precise control over the generated audio, indicating a direct benefit of the specialization phenomenon. By steering activations of the identified layers, we can alter specific musical elements with high precision, such as modulating tempo or changing a track's mood.

"Research reveals that specific attention layers in audio diffusion models control distinct musical concepts, enabling precise manipulation of audio features through activation steering.  					AI-generated summary 				 Audio diffusion models can synthesize high-fidelity music from text, yet their internal mechanisms for representing high-level concepts remain poorly understood. In this work, we use activation patching to demonstrate that distinct semantic musical concepts, such as the presence of specific instruments, vocals, or genre characteristics, are controlled by a small, shared subset of attention layers in state-of-the-art audio diffusion architectures. Next, we demonstrate that applying Contrastive Activation Addition and Sparse Autoencoders in these layers enables more precise control over the generated audio, indicating a direct benefit of the specialization phenomenon. By steering activations of the identified layers, we can alter specific musical elements with high precision, such as modulating tempo or changing a track's mood."

Light4D enables consistent 4D video synthesis under target illumination through disentangled flow guidance and temporal consistent attention mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have established a new paradigm for image and video relighting. However, extending these capabilities to 4D relighting remains challenging, due primarily to the scarcity of paired 4D relighting training data and the difficulty of maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints. In this work, we propose Light4D, a novel training-free framework designed to synthesize consistent 4D videos under target illumination, even under extreme viewpoint changes. First, we introduce Disentangled Flow Guidance, a time-aware strategy that effectively injects lighting control into the latent space while preserving geometric integrity. Second, to reinforce temporal consistency, we develop Temporal Consistent Attention within the IC-Light architecture and further incorporate deterministic regularization to eliminate appearance flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, robustly handling camera rotations from -90 to 90.

Code2Worlds enables 4D dynamic scene generation by formulating it as language-to-simulation code generation with a dual-stream architecture and physics-aware closed-loop refinement.  					AI-generated summary 				 Achieving spatial intelligence requires moving beyond visual plausibility to build world simulators grounded in physical laws. While coding LLMs have advanced static 3D scene generation, extending this paradigm to 4D dynamics remains a critical frontier. This task presents two fundamental challenges: multi-scale context entanglement, where monolithic generation fails to balance local object structures with global environmental layouts; and a semantic-physical execution gap, where open-loop code generation leads to physical hallucinations lacking dynamic fidelity. We introduce Code2Worlds, a framework that formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation. First, we propose a dual-stream architecture that disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. Second, to ensure dynamic fidelity, we establish a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism in which a PostProcess Agent scripts dynamics, coupled with a VLM-Motion Critic that performs self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code. Evaluations on the Code4D benchmark show Code2Worlds outperforms baselines with a 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness, while uniquely generating physics-aware dynamics absent in prior static methods.

GeneralVLA is a hierarchical vision-language-action model that enables zero-shot robotic manipulation through knowledge-guided trajectory planning without requiring real-world data collection.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is that the models exhibit limited zero-shot capability, which hampers their ability to generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce a 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/GeneralVLA.

"GeneralVLA is a hierarchical vision-language-action model that enables zero-shot robotic manipulation through knowledge-guided trajectory planning without requiring real-world data collection.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is that the models exhibit limited zero-shot capability, which hampers their ability to generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce a 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/GeneralVLA.
