However, most sim-real co-training methods rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which treats simulation as static source of demonstrations and does not exploit large-scale closed-loop interaction. Consequently, realworld gains and generalization are often limited. In this paper, we propose an RL-based sim-real Co-training (RL-Co) framework that leverages interactive simulation while preserving real-world capabilities. Our method follows generic two-stage design: we first warm-start the policy with SFT on mixture of real and simulated demonstrations, then fine-tune it with reinforcement learning in simulation while adding an auxiliary supervised loss on real-world data to anchor the policy and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our framework on four real-world tabletop manipulation tasks using two representative VLA architectures, OpenVLA and π0.5, and observe consistent improvements over real-only fine-tuning and SFT-based cotraining, including +24% real-world success on OpenVLA and +20% on π0.5. Beyond higher success rates, RL co-training yields stronger generalization to unseen task variations and substantially improved real-world data efficiency, providing practical and scalable pathway for leveraging simulation to enhance real-robot deployment.

Text:"CoPE-VideoLM: Codec Primitives For Efficient Video Language Models Sayan Deb Sarkar1,2,, Rémi Pautrat2, Ondrej Miksik2, Marc Pollefeys2,3, Iro Armeni1, Mahdi Rad2, Mihai Dusmanu2 1Stanford University, 2Microsoft Spatial AI Lab, 3ETH Zurich Part of work done at Microsoft Equal Supervision Video Language Models (VideoLMs) empower AI systems to understand temporal dynamics in videos. To fit to the maximum context window constraint, current methods use keyframe sampling which can miss both macro-level events and micro-level details due to the sparse temporal coverage. Furthermore, processing full images and their tokens for each frame incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives (specifically motion vectors and residuals) which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning. Our approach reduces the time-to-first-token by up to 86% and token usage by up to 93% compared to standard VideoLMs. Moreover, by varying the keyframe and codec primitive densities we are able to maintain or exceed performance on 14 diverse video understanding benchmarks spanning general question answering, temporal reasoning, long-form understanding, and spatial scene understanding.

Text:"DICE: Diffusion Large Language Models Excel at Generating CUDA Kernels Haolei Bai 1 Lingcheng Kong 1 2 Xueyi Chen 1 Jianmian Wang 3 Zhiqiang Tao 3 Huan Wang 1 https://deadlykitten4.github.io/DICE/ 6 2 0 2 2 1 ] . [ 1 5 1 7 1 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aDiffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, owing to their capacity for parallel token generation. This paradigm is particularly well-suited for code generation, where holistic structural planning and non-sequential refinement are critical. Despite this potential, tailoring dLLMs for CUDA kernel generation remains challenging, obstructed not only by the high specialization but also by the severe lack of highquality training data. To address these challenges, we construct CuKe, an augmented supervised finetuning dataset optimized for high-performance CUDA kernels. On top of it, we propose biphase curated reinforcement learning (BiC-RL) framework consisting of CUDA kernel infilling stage and an end-to-end CUDA kernel generation stage. Leveraging this training framework, we introduce DICE, series of diffusion large language models designed for CUDA kernel generation, spanning three parameter scales, 1.7B, 4B, and 8B. Extensive experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that DICE significantly outperforms both autoregressive and diffusion LLMs of comparable scale, establishing new state-of-the-art for CUDA kernel generation. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have shown powerful ability in range of language tasks, and the dominant paradigm for LLMs is based on autoregressive modeling (Achiam et al., 2023; Grattafiori et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025; Comanici et al., 2025) for long time. Recently, diffusion large language models (dLLMs) (Nie et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2025b; 1Westlake University 2The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 3Rochester Institute of Technology. Correspondence to: Huan Wang <wanghuan@westlake.edu.cn>. Preprint. February 13, 2026. Peng et al., 2025) have emerged as compelling alternative, achieving comparable or even better performance than similarly sized AR LLMs and faster inference speed. Different from the token-by-token generation mechanism introduced by AR LLMs, dLLMs mask the generated sequence and then refine the sequence through iterative denoising steps, which can account for global information and provide remarkably fast inference speed (DeepMind, 2025; Labs et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025). Although dLLMs are rarely designed explicitly for code generation, their native bidirectional attention and iterative refinement paradigm align well with the inherently nonsequential nature of code generation (Gong et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025d; Ni et al., 2025b), which often demands repeated back-and-forth refinement (Xie et al., 2025a). Commercial dLLMs, such as Gemini Diffusion (DeepMind, 2025), Mercury Coder (Labs et al., 2025), and Seed Diffusion (Song et al., 2025), have demonstrated that diffusionbased code models not only match AR LLMs in accuracy across wide range of standard code evaluation benchmarks, but also deliver substantially faster inference speed. Despite the remarkable abilities shown by open-source dLLMs designed for code generation (Gong et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2025b; Peng et al., 2025), the specialized and computationally intensive task of kernel generation remains underexplored in the dLLM field, in stark contrast to the fruitful explorations on AR LLMs (Ouyang et al., 2025; Baronio et al., 2025; Fisches et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025c). Recent studies (Ni et al., 2025a; Prabhudesai et al., 2025) demonstrate the superior data efficiency of dLLMs, especially under data-bound conditions. Given the scarcity of high-quality kernel data (Kong et al., 2025), dLLMs are uniquely positioned to leverage their architectural advantages for this task. Aiming to bridge the gap, this paper introduces DICE, series of dLLMs tailored for CUDA kernel generation, spanning parameter sizes of 1.7B, 4B, and 8B. Our key contributions are summarized as follows: We propose BiC-RL, new reinforcement learning paradigm for the CUDA kernel generation task that features hierarchical progression from easy to hard across both the CUDA kernel data and task complexity. DICE: Diffusion Large Language Models Excel at Generating CUDA Kernels Figure 1. Overview of DICE. The framework enhances CUDA kernel generation robustness in dLLMs by leveraging TraceRL. This hierarchical approach integrates: (1) Bi-phase Curated Reinforcement Learning framework, progressive RL training strategy that consists of kernel infilling and end-to-end kernel generation stages to ensure functional correctness and high performance of generated CUDA kernels, and (2) Data Scheduling, transitioning training data from basic single operations to complex whole-model structures during the two RL stages. valid reward will only be returned when the generated CUDA kernel can be compiled and functions correctly. We introduce CuKe, specifically curated supervised fine-tuning dataset that contains large number of highperformance CUDA kernels. Leveraging BiC-RL, we present DICE, which is the first specialized dLLM designed for CUDA kernel generation, to our best knowledge. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that DICE achieves strong performance against both autoregressive and diffusion LLMs. 2. Preliminary 2.1. Autoregressive Language Models Autoregressive LLMs estimate the probability of sequence = [x1, x2, . . . , xL] by factorizing the joint distribution into conditional probabilities: p(x) = (cid:89) ℓ=1 p(xℓ x<ℓ; θ), (1) where θ denotes the model parameters and x<ℓ represents the prefix of preceding tokens. During inference, the model predicts xℓ conditioned on the previous context in strictly left-to-right manner. The inherent sequential dependency introduces significant inference latency, particularly for long sequences. Furthermore, this rigid generation process diverges from iterative human programming workflows (Li et al., 2025a), which often involve non-linear refinement. These limitations necessitate the exploration of alternative generation paradigms that align more effectively with the generation requirements of kernel programming. 2.2. Block Diffusion Language Models The block diffusion mechanism, also named semiautoregressive diffusion decoding, has been widely adopted by several works (Arriola et al., 2025; Fathi et al"

[ 1 3 6 1 4 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract Large language model (LLM) inference is often bounded by memory footprint and memory bandwidth in resource-constrained deployments, making quantization fundamental technique for efficient serving. While post-training quantization (PTQ) maintains high fidelity at 4-bit, it deteriorates at 2-3 bits. Fundamentally, existing methods enforce shape-invariant quantization grid (e.g., the fixed uniform intervals of UINT2) for each group, severely restricting the feasible set for error minimization. To address this, we propose Bit-Plane Decomposition Quantization (BPDQ), which constructs variable quantization grid via bit-planes and scalar coefficients, and iteratively refines them using approximate second-order information while progressively compensating quantization errors to minimize output discrepancy. In the 2-bit regime, BPDQ enables serving Qwen2.5-72B on single RTX 3090 with 83.85% GSM8K accuracy (vs. 90.83% at 16-bit). Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis showing that the variable grid expands the feasible set, and that the quantization process consistently aligns with the optimization objective in Hessian-induced geometry.

Feature Activation Coverage measures data diversity in an interpretable feature space and enables diversity-driven data synthesis that improves downstream performance across multiple language model architectures.  					AI-generated summary 				 The diversity of post-training data is critical for effective downstream performance in large language models (LLMs). Many existing approaches to constructing post-training data quantify diversity using text-based metrics that capture linguistic variation, but such metrics provide only weak signals for the task-relevant features that determine downstream performance. In this work, we introduce Feature Activation Coverage (FAC) which measures data diversity in an interpretable feature space. Building upon this metric, we further propose a diversity-driven data synthesis framework, named FAC Synthesis, that first uses a sparse autoencoder to identify missing features from a seed dataset, and then generates synthetic samples that explicitly reflect these features. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves both data diversity and downstream performance on various tasks, including instruction following, toxicity detection, reward modeling, and behavior steering. Interestingly, we identify a shared, interpretable feature space across model families (i.e., LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen), enabling cross-model knowledge transfer. Our work provides a solid and practical methodology for exploring data-centric optimization of LLMs.

Reinforcement learning-based sim-real co-training framework improves vision-language-action policy performance through interactive simulation and real-world data anchoring.  					AI-generated summary 				 Simulation offers a scalable and low-cost way to enrich vision-language-action (VLA) training, reducing reliance on expensive real-robot demonstrations. However, most sim-real co-training methods rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which treats simulation as a static source of demonstrations and does not exploit large-scale closed-loop interaction. Consequently, real-world gains and generalization are often limited. In this paper, we propose an \textit{RL}-based sim-real \textit{Co}-training (RL-Co) framework that leverages interactive simulation while preserving real-world capabilities. Our method follows a generic two-stage design: we first warm-start the policy with SFT on a mixture of real and simulated demonstrations, then fine-tune it with reinforcement learning in simulation while adding an auxiliary supervised loss on real-world data to anchor the policy and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our framework on four real-world tabletop manipulation tasks using two representative VLA architectures, OpenVLA and π_{0.5}, and observe consistent improvements over real-only fine-tuning and SFT-based co-training, including +24% real-world success on OpenVLA and +20% on π_{0.5}. Beyond higher success rates, RL co-training yields stronger generalization to unseen task variations and substantially improved real-world data efficiency, providing a practical and scalable pathway for leveraging simulation to enhance real-robot deployment.

"Reinforcement learning-based sim-real co-training framework improves vision-language-action policy performance through interactive simulation and real-world data anchoring.  					AI-generated summary 				 Simulation offers a scalable and low-cost way to enrich vision-language-action (VLA) training, reducing reliance on expensive real-robot demonstrations. However, most sim-real co-training methods rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which treats simulation as a static source of demonstrations and does not exploit large-scale closed-loop interaction. Consequently, real-world gains and generalization are often limited. In this paper, we propose an \textit{RL}-based sim-real \textit{Co}-training (RL-Co) framework that leverages interactive simulation while preserving real-world capabilities. Our method follows a generic two-stage design: we first warm-start the policy with SFT on a mixture of real and simulated demonstrations, then fine-tune it with reinforcement learning in simulation while adding an auxiliary supervised loss on real-world data to anchor the policy and mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Video Language Models (VideoLMs) empower AI systems to understand temporal dynamics in videos. To fit to the maximum context window constraint, current methods use keyframe sampling which can miss both macro-level events and micro-level details due to the sparse temporal coverage. Furthermore, processing full images and their tokens for each frame incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives (specifically motion vectors and residuals) which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through a pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning. Our approach reduces the time-to-first-token by up to 86% and token usage by up to 93% compared to standard VideoLMs. Moreover, by varying the keyframe and codec primitive densities we are able to maintain or exceed performance on 14 diverse video understanding benchmarks spanning general question answering, temporal reasoning, long-form understanding, and spatial scene understanding.

Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) for CUDA kernel generation achieve superior performance through a specialized dataset and reinforcement learning framework.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, owing to their capacity for parallel token generation. This paradigm is particularly well-suited for code generation, where holistic structural planning and non-sequential refinement are critical. Despite this potential, tailoring dLLMs for CUDA kernel generation remains challenging, obstructed not only by the high specialization but also by the severe lack of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we construct CuKe, an augmented supervised fine-tuning dataset optimized for high-performance CUDA kernels. On top of it, we propose a bi-phase curated reinforcement learning (BiC-RL) framework consisting of a CUDA kernel infilling stage and an end-to-end CUDA kernel generation stage. Leveraging this training framework, we introduce DICE, a series of diffusion large language models designed for CUDA kernel generation, spanning three parameter scales, 1.7B, 4B, and 8B. Extensive experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that DICE significantly outperforms both autoregressive and diffusion LLMs of comparable scale, establishing a new state-of-the-art for CUDA kernel generation.

Bit-Plane Decomposition Quantization (BPDQ) improves low-bit quantization by using variable quantization grids derived from bit-planes and scalar coefficients, achieving better accuracy than traditional methods in resource-constrained LLM inference.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language model (LLM) inference is often bounded by memory footprint and memory bandwidth in resource-constrained deployments, making quantization a fundamental technique for efficient serving. While post-training quantization (PTQ) maintains high fidelity at 4-bit, it deteriorates at 2-3 bits. Fundamentally, existing methods enforce a shape-invariant quantization grid (e.g., the fixed uniform intervals of UINT2) for each group, severely restricting the feasible set for error minimization. To address this, we propose Bit-Plane Decomposition Quantization (BPDQ), which constructs a variable quantization grid via bit-planes and scalar coefficients, and iteratively refines them using approximate second-order information while progressively compensating quantization errors to minimize output discrepancy. In the 2-bit regime, BPDQ enables serving Qwen2.5-72B on a single RTX 3090 with 83.85% GSM8K accuracy (vs. 90.83% at 16-bit). Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis showing that the variable grid expands the feasible set, and that the quantization process consistently aligns with the optimization objective in Hessian-induced geometry.

В отличие от традиционных методов, которые используют фиксированную сетку квантизации, предложенный подход применяет переменную сетку, построенную на основе битовых плоскостей и скалярных коэффициентов. Метод итеративно улучшает параметры квантизации, используя информацию второго порядка и компенсируя ошибки на каждом шаге. Эксперименты показывают, что BPDQ достигает высокой точности даже при 2-битной квантизации, позволяя запускать модели размером 72B на одном потребительском GPU.",
