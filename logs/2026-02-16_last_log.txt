Date: February 16, 2026 Correspondence: Benyu Zhang at byzhang@meta.comLarge Language Models (LLMs) represent promising frontier for recommender systems, offering advanced sequence modeling capabilities and extensive world knowledge that can transcend the limitations of traditional embedding-table architectures Kang and McAuley (2018); Zhai et al. (2024). By representing users, items, and interactions within unified linguistic space, LLMs can leverage textual descriptions to generate more sophisticated, content-aware, and explainable recommendations Rajput et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2024); He et al. (2025). The development of such systems at scale, however, requires the establishment of predictable scaling lawsindispensable instruments for navigating the substantial investments in data, computation, and engineering that modern LLM development demands Hoffmann et al. (2022). Yet, despite their established significance in NLP, no robust scaling laws have been established for the continual pre-training (CPT) of LLMs within the recommendation domain Zhou et al. (2025a); He et al. (2025), compelling researchers to depend on costly trial-and-error methodologies. Prior work on scaling LLMs for recommendation has taken model-centric Yan et al. (2025), distillationcentric Lai et al. (2025), or system-centric approaches, while still relying on raw user interaction logs as the primary data source. However, such logs are characterized by systemic flaws: noise, sparsity, andmost criticallypervasive biases including position bias, popularity bias, and exposure bias Chen et al. (2021); Dooley et al. (2023). Recent theoretical and empirical work has shown that scaling laws only manifest when data has sufficient quality and diversity Yang et al. (2024); Allen-Zhu and Li (2024a). Indeed, the PLUM framework He et al. (2025) encountered suboptimal scaling behavior where 3B parameter model failed to consistently outperform its 900M counterparta clear symptom of training on information-poor, structurally biased data.1 from deficient data paradigm. Rather than designing models robust to data imperfections, we shift focus to constructing high-quality, pedagogical data engineered to teach the model the principles of recommendation in structured, unbiased manner. We introduce novel, layered synthetic data framework that systematically decouples true user preference signals from system-induced artifacts. Layer 1 establishes foundational knowledge through item-text alignment and collaborative filtering data, while Layer 2 generates unbiased user interaction histories via graph-based random walks that have no intrinsic concept of position or presentation order. We provide powerful, direct evidence for the utility of this framework. First, standard sequential recommendation models (GRU4Rec Hidasi et al. (2016), NARM Li et al. (2017), STAMP Gao et al. (2025), and SASRec Kang and McAuley (2018)) trained on our synthetic data achieve significantly higher Recall@K than models trained on real data across all cutoff points, demonstrating that our data captures more generalizable user preference patterns. Second, we empirically demonstrate, for the first time, robust power-law scaling for LLMs continually pre-trained on this data. Across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters trained on 163B tokens, we observe consistent scaling behavior characterized by the law L(D) = + Dα. Third, ablation studies reveal an asymmetric synergy between data layers: including collaborative filtering data alongside user interaction histories reduces asymptotic UIH loss by 31% (L = 0.66 vs. 0.95), while the reverse transfer does not holddemonstrating that our layered curriculum provides complementary, non-redundant learning signals. Our quantitative analysis reveals clear hierarchy of learning efficiency across data modalities. User Interaction History (UIH) data exhibits exceptional scaling exponents (α 0.450.59), indicating the model continues to benefit substantially from additional training tokens. Collaborative Filtering (CF) data shows strong scaling (α 0.35), followed by Item-Text alignment (α 0.15). In addition, our experiment has shown introducing CF data helped the learning of UIH data. These findings establish foundational methodology for reliable, predictable LLM development in the recommendation domain, providing practitioners with the first quantitative roadmap for resource allocation and performance forecasting. This paper makes the following principal contributions: layered synthetic data framework that transforms noisy, biased user interaction logs into high-quality curriculum. Layer 1 grounds semantic and collaborative knowledge through item-text alignment and association-rule data; Layer 2 ge"

A novel layered framework generates high-quality synthetic data for large language models in recommender systems, demonstrating superior performance and predictable scaling laws compared to traditional methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a promising frontier for recommender systems, yet their development has been impeded by the absence of predictable scaling laws, which are crucial for guiding research and optimizing resource allocation. We hypothesize that this may be attributed to the inherent noise, bias, and incompleteness of raw user interaction data in prior continual pre-training (CPT) efforts. This paper introduces a novel, layered framework for generating high-quality synthetic data that circumvents such issues by creating a curated, pedagogical curriculum for the LLM. We provide powerful, direct evidence for the utility of our curriculum by showing that standard sequential models trained on our principled synthetic data significantly outperform (+130% on recall@100 for SasRec) models trained on real data in downstream ranking tasks, demonstrating its superiority for learning generalizable user preference patterns. Building on this, we empirically demonstrate, for the first time, robust power-law scaling for an LLM that is continually pre-trained on our high-quality, recommendation-specific data. Our experiments reveal consistent and predictable perplexity reduction across multiple synthetic data modalities. These findings establish a foundational methodology for reliable scaling LLM capabilities in the recommendation domain, thereby shifting the research focus from mitigating data deficiencies to leveraging high-quality, structured information.

"A novel layered framework generates high-quality synthetic data for large language models in recommender systems, demonstrating superior performance and predictable scaling laws compared to traditional methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a promising frontier for recommender systems, yet their development has been impeded by the absence of predictable scaling laws, which are crucial for guiding research and optimizing resource allocation. We hypothesize that this may be attributed to the inherent noise, bias, and incompleteness of raw user interaction data in prior continual pre-training (CPT) efforts. This paper introduces a novel, layered framework for generating high-quality synthetic data that circumvents such issues by creating a curated, pedagogical curriculum for the LLM. We provide powerful, direct evidence for the utility of our curriculum by showing that standard sequential models trained on our principled synthetic data significantly outperform (+130% on recall@100 for SasRec) models trained on real data in downstream ranking tasks, demonstrating its superiority for learning generalizable user preference patterns. Building on this, we empirically demonstrate, for the first time, robust power-law scaling for an LLM that is continually pre-trained on our high-quality, recommendation-specific data. Our experiments reveal consistent and predictable perplexity reduction across multiple synthetic data modalities. These findings establish a foundational methodology for reliable scaling LLM capabilities in the recommendation domain, thereby shifting the research focus from mitigating data deficiencies to leveraging high-quality, structured information."
