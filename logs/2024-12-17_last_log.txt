In the sequence transformation part, efficient algorithms aim to compress element dependency information in limited state, while effective sequence transformation algorithms aim to store all element dependencies. Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) Architecture is popular in modern language modeling, it directly captures the relationship between any two elements in the sequence by calculating the causal mask matrix, which can effectively handle long-distance dependency problems. However, the architecture has major drawback: the quadratic complexity of the Quadratic Causal Self-Attention in the sequence transformation part limits the ability to handle long contexts. State Space Model (Dao and Gu 2024) Architecture came into being, it balances the quadratic and linear calculation methods of relevant elements by calculating the semiseparable matrix, which can achieve linear scaling of sequence length during training and maintain constant state size during generation. However, the architecture also has major drawback: the dependency state of the State Space Duality in the sequence transformation part does not expand with the sequence length to cause dependency bias. In the state transformation part, efficient algorithms aim to sparsely activate knowledge parameters related to elements, while effective algorithms aim to densely activate knowledge parameters related to elements. Gated Multi-Layer Perceptron (Shazeer 2020) consists of Linear layer with dense activation and an activation function, it controls the flow of information through gate units, which can suppress the output of certain neurons. However, the structure has major drawback: each output unit of the Linear layer receives information from all input units, causing the computational complexity to increase with the number of units, leading to difficult to expand. Then series of sparse mixture of experts structures appeared, among which the most efficient is the Mixture of Million Experts (He 2024) mainly composed of embedding layers and activation functions, which maintains computational efficiency through parameter-efficient expert retrieval. However, the structure also has major drawback: one input unit of the Embedding layer only activates one output unit, causing the sharing ratio to not increase with the number of units, leading to redundancy to stored. Algorithm and Architecture. Experiment and Analysis. 1 Figure 1: Wonderful Matrices Architecture. Shows the matrices used in the Wonderful Matrices Architecture, including the Rotary Position Embedding Matrix, State Space Duality Matrix, Dynamic Mask Attention Matrix, Cross Domain Mixture of Experts Matrix, and the process of using these matrices. To build model that is both efficient and effective, the key is to balance the combination relationship between different sequence transformations and state transformations. Our main goal is to integrate the State Space Duality algorithm with the Quadratic Causal Self-Attention algorithm, combining the Linear layer with dense activation and the Embedding layer with sparse activation to overcome their respective limitations. Although this hybrid algorithm foundation model architecture will lose some of the extreme excellence of specific tasks, it will have more comprehensive capabilities. Position Encoding. The key to combining the State Space Duality algorithm and the Quadratic Causal Self-Attention algorithm is to integrate the position information. In Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023), the position information is implicitly provided by causal convolution, and then the matrix skip connect the input and output of the state space algorithm to re-extend the discrete position information. In Mamba2 (Dao and Gu 2024), it is mentioned that the cumulative product of the gate can be directly used to allow two positions to interact with each other as the position information of the state space algorithm. However, convolution operations for position encoding are time-consuming, and recursive position encoding can only be applied to State Space Duality and cannot be applied to Quadratic Causal Self-Attention. Therefore, we prove the availability of Rotary Position Embedding (Su et al. 2021) in State Space Duality to unify the position encoding. Selective Transformation. Another key to combining the State Space Duality algorithm with the Quadratic Causal In the State Space Duality algorithm, selective filtering of Self-Attention algorithm is the same transformation state. sequence state information is achieved through gate matrix, which is equivalent to trainable dynamic mask. In the Quadratic Causal Self-Attention algorithm, future information leakage is prevented by predefined causal mask, which is static mask that relies entirely on human design for additional information filtering. Therefore, we propose dynamic mask"

Instruction tuning has been widely used to unleash the complete potential of large language models. Notably, complex and diverse instructions are of significant importance as they can effectively align models with various downstream tasks. However, current approaches to constructing large-scale instructions predominantly favour powerful models such as GPT-4 or those with over 70 billion parameters, under the empirical presumption that such larger language models (LLMs) inherently possess enhanced capabilities. In this study, we question this prevalent assumption and conduct an in-depth exploration into the potential of smaller language models (SLMs) in the context of instruction evolution. Extensive experiments across three scenarios of instruction evolution reveal that smaller language models (SLMs) can synthesize more effective instructions than LLMs. Further analysis demonstrates that SLMs possess a broader output space during instruction evolution, resulting in more complex and diverse variants. We also observe that the existing metrics fail to focus on the impact of the instructions. Thus, we propose Instruction Complex-Aware IFD (IC-IFD), which introduces instruction complexity in the original IFD score to evaluate the effectiveness of instruction data more accurately.

In order to make the foundation model more efficient and effective, our idea is combining sequence transformation and state transformation. First, we prove the availability of rotary position embedding in the state space duality algorithm, which reduces the perplexity of the hybrid quadratic causal self-attention and state space duality by more than 4%, to ensure that the combining sequence transformation unifies position encoding. Second, we propose dynamic mask attention, which maintains 100% accuracy in the more challenging multi-query associative recall task, improving by more than 150% compared to quadratic causal self-attention and state space duality, to ensure that the combining sequence transformation selectively filters relevant information. Third, we design cross domain mixture of experts, which makes the computational speed of expert retrieval with more than 1024 experts 8 to 10 times faster than the mixture of experts, to ensure that the combining state transformation quickly retrieval mixture. Finally, we summarize these matrix algorithms that can form the foundation model: Wonderful Matrices, which can be a competitor to popular model architectures.

While haircut indicates distinct personality, existing avatar generation methods fail to model practical hair due to the general or entangled representation. We propose StrandHead, a novel text to 3D head avatar generation method capable of generating disentangled 3D hair with strand representation. Without using 3D data for supervision, we demonstrate that realistic hair strands can be generated from prompts by distilling 2D generative diffusion models. To this end, we propose a series of reliable priors on shape initialization, geometric primitives, and statistical haircut features, leading to a stable optimization and text-aligned performance. Extensive experiments show that StrandHead achieves the state-of-the-art reality and diversity of generated 3D head and hair. The generated 3D hair can also be easily implemented in the Unreal Engine for physical simulation and other applications. The code will be available at https://xiaokunsun.github.io/StrandHead.github.io.

Instruction-following is a fundamental capability of language models, requiring the model to recognize even the most subtle requirements in the instructions and accurately reflect them in its output. Such an ability is well-suited for and often optimized by preference learning. However, existing methods often directly sample multiple independent responses from the model when creating preference pairs. Such practice can introduce content variations irrelevant to whether the instruction is precisely followed (e.g., different expressions about the same semantic), interfering with the goal of teaching models to recognize the key differences that lead to improved instruction following. In light of this, we introduce SPaR, a self-play framework integrating tree-search self-refinement to yield valid and comparable preference pairs free from distractions. By playing against itself, an LLM employs a tree-search strategy to refine its previous responses with respect to the instruction while minimizing unnecessary variations. Our experiments show that a LLaMA3-8B model, trained over three iterations guided by SPaR, surpasses GPT-4-Turbo on the IFEval benchmark without losing general capabilities. Furthermore, SPaR demonstrates promising scalability and transferability, greatly enhancing models like GLM-4-9B and LLaMA3-70B. We also identify how inference scaling in tree search would impact model performance. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-coai/SPaR.
