[ 1 4 9 0 2 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r aLarge Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across trainingfree, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLMs effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities. 1. Introduction Transformer-based models (Vaswani et al., 2017) have exhibited exceptional performance across wide range of 1Huawei Noahs Ark Lab 2The University of Hong Kong 3Center of Excellence for Generative AI, KAUST 4Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tubingen. Correspondence to: Han Shi <shi.han@huawei.com>. Technical Report Figure 1. The loss comparison between vanilla Transformer and proposed SepLLM. SepLLM achieves lower loss at different computation costs and different training time consistently. tasks, including natural language processing (Zhang et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2020), computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), and scientific machine learning (Geneva & Zabaras, 2022). However, vanilla Transformers that rely on next-token prediction face significant computational challenges, particularly when scaling to larger models and longer contexts. These computational inefficiencies significantly impact both inference speed and training time. The core challenge underlying these efficiency issues is the self-attention module, which exhibits quadratic complexity with respect to the number of input tokens. Research on efficient Transformers in LLMs primarily follows two major directions. The first approach focuses on linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Schlag et al., 2021), replacing the vanilla self-attention module with alternatives that achieve linear complexity. However, these architectural modifications are significantly different from traditional self-attention, preventing direct utilization of powerful pretrained Transformer models. The second approach emphasizes KV cache optimization (Xiao et al., 2024a; Zhu et al., 2024; Xiao et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024b), aiming to eliminate redundant KV cache to accommodate longer input contexts. For example, Xiao et al. (2024a) introduced an adaptive mechanism that selectively retains essential tokens and their key values based on cumulative attention scores. Similarly, Zhu et al. (2024) proposed token selection strategy with controlled sparsity, achieving near-lossless acceleration. While promising, these training-free methods adapt poorly to the training stage, resulting in discrepancies between training and inference performance. StreamingLLM (Xiao Accelerating LLMs by Compressing One Segment into One Separator est attention weights. Such empirical findings motivate us to propose SepLLM, simple yet effective framework to accelerate inference. Through targeted masking experiments on well-trained LLMs, we demonstrate that separator tokens contain crucial information and are essential for model performance. This finding suggests that sequences are initially segmented by separators, with segment information being compressed into these frequently attended separator tokens while redundant specific tokens are discarded. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate SepLLMs effectiveness across various tasks and datasets, examining performance in training-free, training-fromscratch, and post-training settings. We have made our implementation publicly available at sepllm.github.io. Our codebase supports efficient multinode distributed training with accelerated attention module Sep-Attention and also includes numerous existing Fusion Operators to accelerate the training process, such as fused rope (Su et al., 2023), fused layer norm, etc. 2. Related Work KV Cache Compression. Recent research has focused on overcoming LLMs limitations in processing extensive contextual inputs. FastGen (Ge et al., 2024) proposes an adaptive KV cache management method, optimizing memory usage by customizing retention strategies for different attention heads. SnapKV (Li et al., 2024b) enhances efficiency through KV cache compression, utilizing attention scores to select and cluster significant positions. H2O (Zhang et al., 2024b) implements dynamic token retention policy, balancing recent and historically important information to optimize memory use. StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2024b) expands LLMs capabilities to handle infinite sequence lengths without fine-tuning, by reserving attention sinks and local tokens. QuickLLaMA (Li et al., 2024a) proposes to evict the query-aware KV caches for inference acceleration. PyramidInfer (Yang et al., 2024) and PyramidKV (Zhang et al., 2024a) modify the KV cache capacity throughout various layers, with larger allocation in the lower sections and reduced amount in the upper portions. However, most works in this category cannot be applied into training phase. Sparse Attention. Sparse attention involves creating sparse attention matrices by limiting attention to predefined patterns, such as local windows or fixed-stride block patterns. Beltagy et al. (2020) combine dilated local window attention with task-specific global attention. BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) p"

Text:"WHISPER-GPT: HYBRID REPRESENTATION AUDIO LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL Stanford University, Stanford CA, 94305 4 2 0 2 6 1 ] . [ 1 9 4 4 1 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r ABSTRACT We propose WHISPER-GPT: generative large language model (LLM) for speech and music that allows us to work with continuous audio representations and discrete tokens simultaneously as part of single architecture. There has been huge surge in generative audio, speech, and music models that utilize discrete audio tokens derived from neural compression algorithms, e.g. ENCODEC. However, one of the major drawbacks of this approach is handling the context length. It blows up for high-fidelity generative architecture if one has to account for all the audio contents at various frequencies for the next token prediction. By combining continuous audio representation like the spectrogram and discrete acoustic tokens, we retain the best of both worlds: Have all the information needed from the audio at specific time instance in single token, yet allow LLM to predict the future token to allow for sampling and other benefits discrete space provides. We show how our architecture improves the perplexity and negative log-likelihood scores for the next token prediction compared to token-based LLM for speech and music. 1 Index Terms Hybrid LLMs, Whisper, GPT 1. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK Transformers and LLMs have exponentially surged the advancements in artificial intelligence across fields and modalities. Initially designed for machine translation [1], they were quickly adopted for variety of fields such as text [2], raw audio waveforms[3, 4], acoustic and music tokens [5, 6, 7], videos[8] to name few. It quickly superseded widely popular convolutional architectures too for audio [9, 10] and vision [11] perception. With the recent Gemini family combining modalities from the ground up [12] or multi-modal models like Chameleon [13], the future will bring in even more exciting advancements toward AGI that will allow architectures to "

Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

We propose WHISPER-GPT: A generative large language model (LLM) for speech and music that allows us to work with continuous audio representations and discrete tokens simultaneously as part of a single architecture. There has been a huge surge in generative audio, speech, and music models that utilize discrete audio tokens derived from neural compression algorithms, e.g. ENCODEC. However, one of the major drawbacks of this approach is handling the context length. It blows up for high-fidelity generative architecture if one has to account for all the audio contents at various frequencies for the next token prediction. By combining continuous audio representation like the spectrogram and discrete acoustic tokens, we retain the best of both worlds: Have all the information needed from the audio at a specific time instance in a single token, yet allow LLM to predict the future token to allow for sampling and other benefits discrete space provides. We show how our architecture improves the perplexity and negative log-likelihood scores for the next token prediction compared to a token-based LLM for speech and music.
