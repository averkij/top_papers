[ 1 4 7 9 1 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r EMMA-X: An Embodied Multimodal Action Model with Grounded Chain of Thought and Look-ahead Spatial Reasoning Qi Sun1*, Pengfei Hong1*, Tej Deep Pala1, Vernon Y.H. Toh1, U-Xuan Tan1, Deepanway Ghosal1, Soujanya PoriaGITHUB: https://github.com/declare-lab/Emma-X MODEL: https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/Emma-Xreinforcement Traditional learning-based robotic control methods are often taskspecific and fail to generalize across diverse environments or unseen objects and instructions. Visual Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong scene understanding and lack the ability planning capabilities but to generate actionable policies tailored to specific robotic embodiments. To address this, Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged, yet they face challenges in long-horizon spatial reasoning and grounded task planning. In this work, we propose the Embodied Multimodal Action Model with Grounded Chain of Thought and Look-ahead Spatial Reasoning, EMMA-X. EMMA-X leverages our constructed hierarchical embodiment dataset based on BridgeV2, containing 60,000 robot manipulation trajectories auto-annotated with grounded task reasoning and spatial guidance. Additionally, we introduce trajectory segmentation strategy based on gripper states and motion trajectories, which can help mitigate hallucination in grounding subtask reasoning generation. Experimental results demonstrate that EMMA-X achieves superior competitive baselines, particularly in real-world robotic tasks requiring spatial reasoning. performance overThe robotic policy model aims to generate sequences of low-level action manipulation policies for robots. Traditional reinforcement learningbased robotic control methods often focus on narrowly defined tasks within fixed environments (Ma et al., 2024), hindering their ability to generalize beyond task-specific training data and limiting their tion and task, they lack long-horizon spatial reasoning on how robots should move next. We hypothesize that the completion of subgoals or subtasks can be enhanced if the VLA incorporates look-ahead spatial reasoning, such as inferring the grippers future 2D position and the 3D movement plans necessary for the gripper to reach that position. In particular, we train the VLA model to predict future position gt+k of the gripper as checkpoints and use them to devise high-level movement plan β(gt, gt+k). This plan informs the immediate action at at the current state st, ensuring decisions are both reactive to the present and aligned with long-term objectives. Similar to delivery driver planning route with key landmarks to make purposeful driving decisions, this approach optimizes task completion by balancing foresight and adaptability. Additionally, another limitation in task reasoning provided by ECoT(Zawalski et al., 2024) is the absence of visual grounding when augmenting reasoning data using Gemini. We observe that Gemini frequently hallucinates due to lack of holistic understanding of the setup and environment. As shown in Figure 1, the image shows that the robot already started to grasp the pot cover, while the task reasoning indicates the subtask is still Move to silver pot cover", which conflicts with the following reasoning they provided. In this work, we introduce the Embodied Multimodal Action Model with Grounded Chain of Thought Reasoning, EMMA-X. We develop hierarchical embodiment dataset based on BridgeV2, consisting of 60,000 robot manipulation trajectories. For each state of given trajectory, we generate detailed spatial reasoning grounded in the environment and task reasoning, such as the plans of how the robot should perform the subtask. As shown in Figure 1, we also generate the 2D gripper position, and 3D spatial movements of the gripper to transit to future states, which enable the VLA model to reason long-horizon plan for accomplishing the task. Furthermore, we utilize Gemini (Team et al., 2023) to generate grounded task reasoning for each observed state. To avoid the abovementioned reasoning conflict problem of task reasoning in ECoT, we propose novel trajectory segmentation strategy, which leverages the opening and closing states of the gripper and the motion trajectory of the robot arm to segment the sequence of states into distinct segments. By grounding, we mean that, unlike Figure 1: Comparison of our EMMA-X with ECoT in task reasoning. While both approaches utilize Gemini, our method also incorporates image sequence input, whereas ECoT relies solely on text input. We also illustrate an example of spatial reasoning. applicability (Brohan et al., 2023b; Chi et al.). Recent advancements in foundation models for vision and language have highlighted the remarkable scene-understanding and task-planning capabilities (Radford et al., 2021; Zhai et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023). These Visual-Language Models (VLMs) excel at breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps through chain-of-thought reasoning and demonstrate significant potential in planning. Despite their strengths, VLMs are not inherently designed to directly generate policies applicable to specific embodiment configurations in robotics. This limitation has spurred the emergence of Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models, which aim to bridge this gap by leveraging multimodal inputs to produce adaptive and generalized robotic actions for complex, multi-task scenarios (Brohan et al., 2023a; Kim et al., 2024; Octo Model Team et al., 2024). However, most of the existing VLA models often exhibit muscle memory response patterns, struggling to perceive scene variation and understand instructions as humans do when handling complex tasks or ambiguous commands. Zawalski et al. (2024) attempts to address this issue through visual and task reasoning, including the bounding box of the object, task segmentation, and the direction of predicted action, etc. Although they equip VLAs with an understanding of the current situaECoT, which prompts Gemini to generate subtask reasoning based solely on textual descriptions, our approach incorporates visual images segmented using the aforementioned strategy. As shown in Figure 1, our method can accurately provide the subtask Grasping the pot cover" corresponding to the current robotic state. This illustrates that our strategy significantly reduces Geminis hallucination issues by requiring it to construct visual understanding of the environment, rather than relying solely on textual descriptions of "

Video face swapping is becoming increasingly popular across various applications, yet existing methods primarily focus on static images and struggle with video face swapping because of temporal consistency and complex scenarios. In this paper, we present the first diffusion-based framework specifically designed for video face swapping. Our approach introduces a novel image-video hybrid training framework that leverages both abundant static image data and temporal video sequences, addressing the inherent limitations of video-only training. The framework incorporates a specially designed diffusion model coupled with a VidFaceVAE that effectively processes both types of data to better maintain temporal coherence of the generated videos. To further disentangle identity and pose features, we construct the Attribute-Identity Disentanglement Triplet (AIDT) Dataset, where each triplet has three face images, with two images sharing the same pose and two sharing the same identity. Enhanced with a comprehensive occlusion augmentation, this dataset also improves robustness against occlusions. Additionally, we integrate 3D reconstruction techniques as input conditioning to our network for handling large pose variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance in identity preservation, temporal consistency, and visual quality compared to existing methods, while requiring fewer inference steps. Our approach effectively mitigates key challenges in video face swapping, including temporal flickering, identity preservation, and robustness to occlusions and pose variations.

Traditional reinforcement learning-based robotic control methods are often task-specific and fail to generalize across diverse environments or unseen objects and instructions. Visual Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong scene understanding and planning capabilities but lack the ability to generate actionable policies tailored to specific robotic embodiments. To address this, Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged, yet they face challenges in long-horizon spatial reasoning and grounded task planning. In this work, we propose the Embodied Multimodal Action Model with Grounded Chain of Thought and Look-ahead Spatial Reasoning, Emma-X. Emma-X leverages our constructed hierarchical embodiment dataset based on BridgeV2, containing 60,000 robot manipulation trajectories auto-annotated with grounded task reasoning and spatial guidance. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory segmentation strategy based on gripper states and motion trajectories, which can help mitigate hallucination in grounding subtask reasoning generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Emma-X achieves superior performance over competitive baselines, particularly in real-world robotic tasks requiring spatial reasoning.

"Traditional reinforcement learning-based robotic control methods are often task-specific and fail to generalize across diverse environments or unseen objects and instructions. Visual Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong scene understanding and planning capabilities but lack the ability to generate actionable policies tailored to specific robotic embodiments. To address this, Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged, yet they face challenges in long-horizon spatial reasoning and grounded task planning. In this work, we propose the Embodied Multimodal Action Model with Grounded Chain of Thought and Look-ahead Spatial Reasoning, Emma-X. Emma-X leverages our constructed hierarchical embodiment dataset based on BridgeV2, containing 60,000 robot manipulation trajectories auto-annotated with grounded task reasoning and spatial guidance. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory segmentation strategy based on gripper states and motion trajectories, which can help mitigate hallucination in grounding subtask reasoning generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Emma-X achieves superior performance over competitive baselines, particularly in real-world robotic tasks requiring spatial reasoning."

The increasing demand for immersive AR/VR applications and spatial intelligence has heightened the need to generate high-quality scene-level and 360{\deg} panoramic video. However, most video diffusion models are constrained by limited resolution and aspect ratio, which restricts their applicability to scene-level dynamic content synthesis. In this work, we propose the DynamicScaler, addressing these challenges by enabling spatially scalable and panoramic dynamic scene synthesis that preserves coherence across panoramic scenes of arbitrary size. Specifically, we introduce a Offset Shifting Denoiser, facilitating efficient, synchronous, and coherent denoising panoramic dynamic scenes via a diffusion model with fixed resolution through a seamless rotating Window, which ensures seamless boundary transitions and consistency across the entire panoramic space, accommodating varying resolutions and aspect ratios. Additionally, we employ a Global Motion Guidance mechanism to ensure both local detail fidelity and global motion continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior content and motion quality in panoramic scene-level video generation, offering a training-free, efficient, and scalable solution for immersive dynamic scene creation with constant VRAM consumption regardless of the output video resolution.
