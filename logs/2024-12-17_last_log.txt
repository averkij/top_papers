Text:"Kunchang Li ByteDance causalfusion.git4 2 0 2 6 1 ] . [ 1 5 9 0 2 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r aWe introduce Causal Diffusion as the autoregressive (AR) counterpart of Diffusion models. It is next-token(s) forecasting framework that is friendly to both discrete and continuous modalities and compatible with existing nexttoken prediction models like LLaMA and GPT. While recent works attempt to combine diffusion with AR models, we show that introducing sequential factorization to diffusion model can substantially improve its performance and enables smooth transition between AR and diffusion generation modes. Hence, we propose CausalFusion - decoderonly transformer that dual-factorizes data across sequential tokens and diffusion noise levels, leading to state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet generation benchmark while also enjoying the AR advantage of generating an arbitrary number of tokens for in-context reasoning. We further demonstrate CausalFusions multimodal capabilities through joint image generation and captioning model, and showcase CausalFusions ability for zero-shot in-context image manipulations. We hope that this work could provide the community with fresh perspective on training multimodal models over discrete and continuous data. 1. Introduction Autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models are two powerful paradigms for data distribution modeling. AR models, also known as the next token prediction approach, dominate language modeling and are considered central to the success of large language models (LLMs) [5, 16, 46, 47, 61, 62]. On the other hand, diffusion models [13, 26, 29, 44], or scorebased generative models [37, 54], have emerged as the leading approach for visual generation, driving unprecedented progress in the era of visual content generation [4, 17, 50]. The intrinsic distinction between AR and diffusion models lies in their approach to data distribution factorization. AR models treat data as an ordered sequence, factorizing it along the sequential axis, where the probability of each token is conditioned on all preceding tokens. This factorization enables the AR paradigm to generalize effectively and efficiently across arbitrary number of tokens, making it Figure 1. Illustration of Dual-Factorization. The arrow line indicates CausalFusions generation path, moving from one state to the next by jointly generating along the sequential and noise-level dimension at each step. Compared to DiT, our In-context DiT substantially improves results with fewer parameters. CausalFusion further enhances performance without changing the architecture or parameter count. Results were trained on IN1K for 240 epochs. CausalFusion adopts arbitrary AR steps for image generation, but each step only diffuses partial tokens, resulting in similar (or slightly lower) computational complexity. well-suited for long-sequence reasoning and in-context generation. In contrast, diffusion models factorize data along the noise-level axis, where the tokens at each step are refined (denoised) version of themselves from the previous step. As result, the diffusion paradigm is generalizable to arbitrary number of data refinement steps, enabling iterative quality improvement with scaled inference compute. While AR and diffusion models each excel within their respective domains, their distinct factorization approaches reveal complementary potential. Although recent studies [21, 72, 75] have attempted to integrate AR and diffusion within sin- (a) Samples generated by CausalFusion-XL/2, ImageNet 512512, 800 epoch, DDPM 250 steps, CFG=4.0 (b) Zero-shot image editing results generated by CausalFusion-XL/2, ImageNet 512512, 800 epoch. We first generate the original image (those on the left), then mask out its centre region, top-half, or bottom-half, and regenerate the image with new class conditions. Details are discussed in Sec 6. Figure 2. Visualization results. All samples are generated by models trained only on ImageNet-1K class-conditional generation task, demonstrating CausalFusions zero-shot image manipulation ability. See more visualization results in Appendix D. gle model, they typically treat these paradigms as separate modes, missing the potential benefits of jointly exploring them within 2-D factorization plane. To this end, we introduce CausalFusion, flexible framework that integrates both sequential and noise-level data factorization to unify their advantages. The degree of factorization along these two axesnamely, the AR step and diffusion stepis adjustable, enabling CausalFusion to revert seamlessly to the traditional AR or diffusion paradigms at either extreme. To enhance its generality, CausalFusion is designed to predict any number of tokens at any AR step, with any pre-defined sequence order and any level of inference compute, thereby minimizing the inductive biases presented in existing generative models. As shown in Figure 1, this approach provides broad spectrum between the AR and diffusion paradigms, allowing smooth interpolation within two endpoints during both training and inference. Specifically, we explore CausalFusion in image generation and multimodal generation scenarios, where we observe that the level of training difficulties significantly influences the overall effectiveness of CausalFusion. Difficulties of generative tasks in CausalFusion: Both AR and diffusion paradigms present unique challenges based on difficulties of their specific generative stages. In diffusion models, the effectiveness of training depends heavily on proper loss weighting across noise levels [22, 26], as higher noise levels are more difficult and usually provide more valuable signals than lower noise levels. Similarly, AR models are susceptible to error accumulation [3] as early-stage predictions are made with limited visible context, making them more error-prone. Optimizing CausalFusion thus requires balancing across these varying task difficulties to optimize training signal impact and ensure sufficient exploration across the entire factorization plane. In this paper, we formally examine the difficulties of generative tasks within CausalFusion. We show that, in addition to the noise levels in diffusion and the amount of visible context in AR, the total number of AR steps, which controls the interpolation between AR and diffusion, also plays critical role in shaping training difficulties. Driven by these factors, we develop scalable and versatile model based on the CausalFusion framework. Starting from the Di"

Recent advancements in visual generative models have enabled high-quality image and video generation, opening diverse applications. However, evaluating these models often demands sampling hundreds or thousands of images or videos, making the process computationally expensive, especially for diffusion-based models with inherently slow sampling. Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools. Experiments show that Evaluation Agent reduces evaluation time to 10% of traditional methods while delivering comparable results. The Evaluation Agent framework is fully open-sourced to advance research in visual generative models and their efficient evaluation.

We introduce Causal Diffusion as the autoregressive (AR) counterpart of Diffusion models. It is a next-token(s) forecasting framework that is friendly to both discrete and continuous modalities and compatible with existing next-token prediction models like LLaMA and GPT. While recent works attempt to combine diffusion with AR models, we show that introducing sequential factorization to a diffusion model can substantially improve its performance and enables a smooth transition between AR and diffusion generation modes. Hence, we propose CausalFusion - a decoder-only transformer that dual-factorizes data across sequential tokens and diffusion noise levels, leading to state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet generation benchmark while also enjoying the AR advantage of generating an arbitrary number of tokens for in-context reasoning. We further demonstrate CausalFusion's multimodal capabilities through a joint image generation and captioning model, and showcase CausalFusion's ability for zero-shot in-context image manipulations. We hope that this work could provide the community with a fresh perspective on training multimodal models over discrete and continuous data.

Automatic black-and-white image sequence colorization while preserving character and object identity (ID) is a complex task with significant market demand, such as in cartoon or comic series colorization. Despite advancements in visual colorization using large-scale generative models like diffusion models, challenges with controllability and identity consistency persist, making current solutions unsuitable for industrial application.To address this, we propose ColorFlow, a three-stage diffusion-based framework tailored for image sequence colorization in industrial applications. Unlike existing methods that require per-ID finetuning or explicit ID embedding extraction, we propose a novel robust and generalizable Retrieval Augmented Colorization pipeline for colorizing images with relevant color references. Our pipeline also features a dual-branch design: one branch for color identity extraction and the other for colorization, leveraging the strengths of diffusion models. We utilize the self-attention mechanism in diffusion models for strong in-context learning and color identity matching. To evaluate our model, we introduce ColorFlow-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for reference-based colorization. Results show that ColorFlow outperforms existing models across multiple metrics, setting a new standard in sequential image colorization and potentially benefiting the art industry. We release our codes and models on our project page: https://zhuang2002.github.io/ColorFlow/.

This paper addresses a challenging question: How can we efficiently create high-quality, wide-scope 3D scenes from a single arbitrary image? Existing methods face several constraints, such as requiring multi-view data, time-consuming per-scene optimization, low visual quality in backgrounds, and distorted reconstructions in unseen areas. We propose a novel pipeline to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale reconstruction model that uses latents from a video diffusion model to predict 3D Gaussian Splattings for the scenes in a feed-forward manner. The video diffusion model is designed to create videos precisely following specified camera trajectories, allowing it to generate compressed video latents that contain multi-view information while maintaining 3D consistency. We train the 3D reconstruction model to operate on the video latent space with a progressive training strategy, enabling the efficient generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes. Extensive evaluations across various datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing methods for single-view 3D scene generation, particularly with out-of-domain images. For the first time, we demonstrate that a 3D reconstruction model can be effectively built upon the latent space of a diffusion model to realize efficient 3D scene generation.

"This paper addresses a challenging question: How can we efficiently create high-quality, wide-scope 3D scenes from a single arbitrary image? Existing methods face several constraints, such as requiring multi-view data, time-consuming per-scene optimization, low visual quality in backgrounds, and distorted reconstructions in unseen areas. We propose a novel pipeline to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale reconstruction model that uses latents from a video diffusion model to predict 3D Gaussian Splattings for the scenes in a feed-forward manner. The video diffusion model is designed to create videos precisely following specified camera trajectories, allowing it to generate compressed video latents that contain multi-view information while maintaining 3D consistency. We train the 3D reconstruction model to operate on the video latent space with a progressive training strategy, enabling the efficient generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes. Extensive evaluations across various datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing methods for single-view 3D scene generation, particularly with out-of-domain images. For the first time, we demonstrate that a 3D reconstruction model can be effectively built upon the latent space of a diffusion model to realize efficient 3D scene generation."
