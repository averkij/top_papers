Text:"Efficient Generative Modeling with Residual Vector Quantization-Based Tokens Jaehyeon Kim * 1 Taehong Moon * 2 Keon Lee 2 Jaewoong Cho 2 4 2 0 2 6 1 ] . [ 2 8 0 2 0 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r Abstract We explore the use of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) for high-fidelity generation in vectorquantized generative models. This quantization technique maintains higher data fidelity by employing more in-depth tokens. However, increasing the token number in generative models leads to slower inference speeds. To this end, we introduce ResGen, an efficient RVQ-based discrete diffusion model that generates high-fidelity samples without compromising sampling speed. Our key idea is direct prediction of vector embedding of collective tokens rather than individual ones. Moreover, we demonstrate that our proposed token masking and multi-token prediction method can be formulated within principled probabilistic framework using discrete diffusion process and variational inference. We validate the efficacy and generalizability of the proposed method on two challenging tasks across different modalities: conditional image generation on ImageNet 256256 and zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that ResGen outperforms autoregressive counterparts in both tasks, delivering superior performance without compromising sampling speed. Furthermore, as we scale the depth of RVQ, our generative models exhibit enhanced generation fidelity or faster sampling speeds compared to similarly sized baseline models. The project page can be found at https://resgen-genai.github.io. 1. Introduction Recent advancements in deep generative models have shown significant success in high-quality, realistic data generation across multiple domains, including language modeling (Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Reid et al., 2024), image generation (Rombach et al., 2022; Saharia *Equal contribution 1NVIDIA 2KRAFTON.

We explore the use of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) for high-fidelity generation in vector-quantized generative models. This quantization technique maintains higher data fidelity by employing more in-depth tokens. However, increasing the token number in generative models leads to slower inference speeds. To this end, we introduce ResGen, an efficient RVQ-based discrete diffusion model that generates high-fidelity samples without compromising sampling speed. Our key idea is a direct prediction of vector embedding of collective tokens rather than individual ones. Moreover, we demonstrate that our proposed token masking and multi-token prediction method can be formulated within a principled probabilistic framework using a discrete diffusion process and variational inference. We validate the efficacy and generalizability of the proposed method on two challenging tasks across different modalities: conditional image generation} on ImageNet 256x256 and zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that ResGen outperforms autoregressive counterparts in both tasks, delivering superior performance without compromising sampling speed. Furthermore, as we scale the depth of RVQ, our generative models exhibit enhanced generation fidelity or faster sampling speeds compared to similarly sized baseline models.

ResGen позволяет генерировать высококачественные образцы без снижения скорости сэмплирования. Ключевая идея заключается в прямом предсказании векторного вложения коллективных токенов, а не отдельных. Авторы демонстрируют эффективность метода на задачах условной генерации изображений и синтеза речи по тексту. Результаты показывают, что ResGen превосходит авторегрессивные аналоги по качеству и скорости генерации.",
