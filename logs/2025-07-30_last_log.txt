[ 1 8 5 0 2 2 . 7 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Equipped with reinforcement learning, X-Omni integrates image and language modeling in unified autoregressive framework, enabling it to generate high-quality images following complex instructions and render long text in both English and Chinese.Numerous efforts have been made to extend the next token prediction paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create unified approach for both image generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of discrete autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image and language generation. Our framework comprises semantic image tokenizer, unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using 7B language model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.The next token prediction paradigm in language modeling has catalyzed the ongoing AI revolution [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This intuitiveness stems from languages inherent properties: tokens are discrete and sequentially structured. In the image domain, pioneering works like iGPT and DALL-E attempted to replicate this paradigm for image generation by discretizing images into sequential tokens and generating content through per-step token prediction. Notably, DALL-E demonstrated the feasibility of generating impressive images from text inputs. However, the image quality produced by early DALL-E remained limited. Despite subsequent efforts to enhance qualitysuch as those in [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]generated images still exhibited relatively low fidelity. This limitation is likely attributable to cumulative errors arising from the sequential generation of image tokens. It is presumably due to this issue that the field has experienced swift transition toward the adoption of diffusion models for this task [16, 17, 18, 19]. Unfortunately, the architectural and modeling heterogeneity of these approaches presents challenges for integrating robust semantic capabilities into image generation. While various hybrid designs [20, 21, 22, 23] have been proposed to address this issue, the inherent cross-modal modeling mismatch remains barrier, resulting in suboptimal solutions. Notably, recent research interest has shifted toward jointly training image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with autoregressive objectives [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32], which has further exacerbated this modeling mismatch. In this work, we advocate for discrete autoregressive framework for image generation that unifies the modeling of text and images, thereby facilitating better knowledge transfer and capability sharing across vision and language modalities. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning can significantly mitigate the limitations of autoregressive methods. When paired with carefully designed reward models, reinforcement learning enables automatic refinement of generative models effectively reducing cumulative errors and producing tokens that align more closely with diffusion decoders. As illustrated in Figure 2(c), the autoregressive generative models after supervised fine-tuning (SFT) produce relatively low-quality outputs, characterized by incorrect text generation, distorted body features, and failure to follow intricate instructions. During the reinforcement learning process, the aesthetic quality of generated images is gradually enhanced, and the ability to adhere to instructions and the capacity to render long texts improve steadily. Figure 1 presents additional examples generated by our proposed method, which demonstrate high-quality visual appearances, robust capability in following complex instructions, and accurate rendering of long texts in both English and Chinese. Another key feature of our design lies in the adoption of semantic encoderssuch as SigLIP 2to generate discrete tokens, choice that also lends itself naturally to image understanding tasks. Figure 2: During the reinforcement learning process, X-Omnis image generation reward quickly surpassed the best-of-N results achieved by the SFT model (SFT BoN) and demonstrated steady improvement. This progress was reflected in the models text rendering capabilities, the aesthetic quality of the generated images, and its ability to follow instructions, all of which improved gradually. Combining with the isomorphic autoregressive modeling shared between image and text generation, we can seamlessly integrate the two core tasks of image generation and image understanding within unified network. In contrast to recent works that rely on heterogeneous image encoders [21, 30, 33], our approach eliminates the need to re-extract semantic embeddings from generated images for understanding purposes during multi-turn joint image understanding and generation. This makes the overall architecture substantially more streamlined and efficient. We refer to this network as X-Omni. Through this work, we aim to redirect research attention back to discrete autoregressive methods for image generation.Continuous tokens versus discrete tokens. Recent advancements in next-token prediction have showcased remarkable capabilities in both language and image understanding tasks, "

Text:"Evaluating Deep Learning Models for African Wildlife Image Classification: From DenseNet to Vision Transformers Lukman Jibril Aliyu Arewa Data Science Academy Kano, Nigeria lukman.j.aliyu@gmail.com Umar Sani Muhammad Azman University Kano, Nigeria Bilqisu Ismail Arewa Data Science Academy Kano, Nigeria Nasiru Muhammad Arewa Data Science Academy Kano, Nigeria Almustapha A. Wakili Towson University Maryland, USA Seid Muhie Yimam Universitat Hamburg Hamburg, Germany Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad Imperial College London London, United Kingdom Mustapha Abdullahi Arewa Data Science Academy Kano, Nigeria AbstractWildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image classification using deep learning has emerged as promising tool for biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents comparative study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we evaluate the performance of DenseNet201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and Vision Transformer ViTH/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost, raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN (DenseNet-201) was integrated into Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in conservation settings. This work contributes to Africangrounded AI research by offering practical insights into model selection, dataset preparation, and responsible deployment of deep learning tools for wildlife conservation.

MaPPO, a framework for preference optimization, enhances alignment of large language models with human preferences by integrating prior reward knowledge into a Maximum a Posteriori objective, improving performance across various benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds, Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective. This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO.

"MaPPO, a framework for preference optimization, enhances alignment of large language models with human preferences by integrating prior reward knowledge into a Maximum a Posteriori objective, improving performance across various benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds, Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective. This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency."

A new dataset and baseline method for motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation are introduced, addressing challenges in motion understanding.  					AI-generated summary 				 This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS), which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid foundation for future research in this direction.

A comparative study of deep learning models for wildlife image classification highlights trade-offs between accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability, with DenseNet-201 and Vision Transformer ViT-H/14 performing best among evaluated models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using a public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost, raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN (DenseNet-201) was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in conservation settings. This work contributes to African-grounded AI research by offering practical insights into model selection, dataset preparation, and responsible deployment of deep learning tools for wildlife conservation.
