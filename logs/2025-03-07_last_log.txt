[ 1 5 2 7 4 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r aWe rigorously establish bipartite mutual information scaling law in natural language that governs long-range dependencies. This scaling law, which we show is distinct from and scales independently of the conventional twopoint mutual information, is the key to understanding long-context language modeling. Using this scaling law, we formulate the Long-context Language Modeling (L2M) condition, which relates models capacity for effective long context length modeling to the scaling of its latent state size for storing past information. Our results are validated through experiments on both transformers and state space models. This work establishes theoretical foundation that guides the development of large language models toward longer context lengths. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, achieving remarkable capabilities across wide range of tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a;b). Recent advances, particularly with models like GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2024), Claude-3.5, LLaMA-3 (Grattafiori et al., 2024), and DeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024), have demonstrated breakthroughs in tasks from code generation to mathematical problem solving, from text summarization to creative writing (Stiennon et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2022; Gou et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). These models have become increasingly powerful and versatile, pushing the boundaries of whats possible in natural language processing and marking significant steps toward artificial general intelligence (Bubeck et al., 2023; Ge et al., 2023; Kosinski, 2023). 1{chenzhuo, omayne, jinzhta, diluo, soljacic}@mit.edu 2NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions 3Massachusetts Institute of Technology 4Polytechnic University of Catalonia 5Harvard University 6University of California, Los Angeles. Correspondence to: Zhuo Chen <chenzhuo@mit.edu>. Preprint. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). Figure 1. Illustration of the central idea of our paper. (a) random block of text of length is divided into two parts and . (b) The (bipartite) mutual information between the random variables and has power-law scaling with respect to the length. (c) Autoregressive neural networks parameterize conditional distributions q(yx) = (yxℓ, z) via hidden state that caches past information. (d) We formulate the Long-context Language Modeling (L2M) condition, which states that models state size for storing past information must grow at least as the power-law scaling of the bipartite mutual information for effective long context length modeling. In pushing these advances further, the ability to handle long contexts has become increasingly crucial. This ability is the key to document-level understanding, multi-turn dialogue, and complex reasoning. Models like GPT-o1 and DeepSeekR1 often generate extensive chains of thought, sometimes spanning thousands of tokens to solve complex problems (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024). However, processing long contexts remains significant challenge. While transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success and recent advances like DeepSeek have dramatically improved the efficiency (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024), they still suffer from the intrinsic computational cost quadratic in sequence length, resulting in challenges in long sequence length generation. Although various architectures have been proposed to address the quadratic scaling (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2022a; Zhu et al., 2021; Beltagy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2023; Gu & Dao, 2024; Dao & Gu, 2024; Peng et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2024), fundamental gap persists in our theoretical understanding of how their effectiveness for capL2M: Mutual Information Scaling Law for Long-Context Language Modeling turing long-range dependencies scales. In spite of existing efforts to characterize these dependencies through various statistical measures (Ebeling & Poschel, 1994a; Debowski, 2011; Bentz et al., 2017; Futrell et al., 2019) theories guiding practical efficient architecture design have not yet been formulated. In this work, we address the challenges of understanding long-context language modeling through the following contributions  (Fig. 1)  . 1. We establish bipartite mutual information scaling law, based on the relaxed Hilberg conjecture (Hilberg, 1990; Łukasz Debowski, 2015), which governs the true long-range dependencies of natural language and is the key to understanding long-context language modeling, fundamentally distinct from conventional two-point mutual information scaling. 2. We validate this new scaling law across various natural language datasets using state-of-the-art LLMs, including both LLaMA (Grattafiori et al., 2024) and DeepSeek (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024) models, revealing strongly consistent power-law growth behavior. 3. We formulate the Long-context Language Modeling (L2M) condition and prove that models state size for storing past information must scale faster than the bipartite mutual information scaling for effective long context length modeling, which is further empirically verified with transformer and state space models trained on varying sequence lengths. Our theoretical foundation for understanding LLMs capability for long sequence length modeling provides crucial insights and quantitative analysis for improving LLM architectures, enabling more effective long-context applications, and guiding the development of more capable and scalable AI systems. 2. Related Works 2.1. Mutual Information Estimation and Application in Machine Learning Mutual information estimation and optimization have been extensively studied in machine learning, with approaches including variational bounds (Poole et al., 2019), neural estimators (Belghazi et al., 2021), nearest-neighbor methods (Kraskov et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2015), and various upper bounds (Cheng et al., 2020). It has wide applications in feature selection (Brown et al., 2012), representation learning (Tschannen et al., 2020), disentanglement (Chen et al., 2016), and generative modeling (Hjelm et al., 2019). 2.2.

"We rigorously establish a bipartite mutual information scaling law in natural language that governs long-range dependencies. This scaling law, which we show is distinct from and scales independently of the conventional two-point mutual information, is the key to understanding long-context language modeling. Using this scaling law, we formulate the Long-context Language Modeling (L^2M) condition, which relates a model's capacity for effective long context length modeling to the scaling of its latent state size for storing past information. Our results are validated through experiments on both transformers and state space models. This work establishes a theoretical foundation that guides the development of large language models toward longer context lengths."
