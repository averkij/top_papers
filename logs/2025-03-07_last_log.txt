We introduce FuseChat-3.0, a suite of large language models (LLMs) developed by integrating the strengths of heterogeneous source LLMs into more compact target LLMs. Our source models include the powerful Gemma-2-27B-it, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. For target models, we focus on three widely-used smaller variants-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9B-it, and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct-along with two ultra-compact options, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. To leverage the diverse capabilities of these source models, we develop a specialized data construction protocol tailored to various tasks and domains. The FuseChat-3.0 training pipeline consists of two key stages: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the target and source model distributions, and (2) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to apply preferences from multiple source LLMs to fine-tune the target model. The resulting FuseChat-3.0 models exhibit significant performance gains across tasks such as instruction following, general knowledge, mathematics, and coding. As illustrated in Figure 1, using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as the target model, our fusion approach achieves an average improvement of 6.8 points across 14 benchmarks. Moreover, it demonstrates remarkable gains of 37.1 points and 30.1 points on the instruction-following benchmarks AlpacaEval-2 and Arena-Hard, respectively. Our code, models, and datasets are available at https://github.com/SLIT-AI/FuseChat-3.0.

Inference-Time Scaling has been critical to the success of recent models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1. However, many techniques used to train models for inference-time scaling require tasks to have answers that can be verified, limiting their application to domains such as math, coding and logical reasoning. We take inspiration from how humans make first attempts, ask for detailed feedback from others and make improvements based on such feedback across a wide spectrum of open-ended endeavors. To this end, we collect data for and train dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that are capable of performing inference-time scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. In our setup, one model generates an initial response, which are given feedback by a second model, that are then used by a third model to edit the response. We show that performance on Arena Hard, a benchmark strongly predictive of Chatbot Arena Elo can be boosted by scaling the number of initial response drafts, effective feedback and edited responses. When scaled optimally, our setup based on 70B models from the Llama 3 family can reach SoTA performance on Arena Hard at 92.7 as of 5 Mar 2025, surpassing OpenAI o1-preview-2024-09-12 with 90.4 and DeepSeek R1 with 92.3.

"Inference-Time Scaling has been critical to the success of recent models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1. However, many techniques used to train models for inference-time scaling require tasks to have answers that can be verified, limiting their application to domains such as math, coding and logical reasoning. We take inspiration from how humans make first attempts, ask for detailed feedback from others and make improvements based on such feedback across a wide spectrum of open-ended endeavors. To this end, we collect data for and train dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that are capable of performing inference-time scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. In our setup, one model generates an initial response, which are given feedback by a second model, that are then used by a third model to edit the response. We show that performance on Arena Hard, a benchmark strongly predictive of Chatbot Arena Elo can be boosted by scaling the number of initial response drafts, effective feedback and edited responses. When scaled optimally, our setup based on 70B models from the Llama 3 family can reach SoTA performance on Arena Hard at 92.7 as of 5 Mar 2025, surpassing OpenAI o1-preview-2024-09-12 with 90.4 and DeepSeek R1 with 92.3."
