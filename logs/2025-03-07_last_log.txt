Videos, code, and dataset available at https: //sites.google.com/view/pokechamp-llm.Prior work in reinforcement learning has achieved significant success, attaining superhuman performance in wide range of games, including Chess, Go, and Poker, through extensive imitation learning and self-play (Campbell et al., 2002; Silver et al., 2017, 2016; Brown & Sandholm, 2019, 2018; Vinyals et al., 2019; Berner et al., 2019). However, these approaches typically require substantial task-specific training and engineering. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs), which often function as generalist agents, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains. Language agents can leverage prior knowledge of game strategies and generalize to new situations without additional training. Despite their promise, recent studies highlight limitations in the planning capabilities of text-based language agents (Topsakal & Harper, 2024). These agents frequently underperform compared to hardcoded heuristic bots in game environments (Küttler et al., 2020) and struggle to grasp basic game mechanics (Hu et al., 2024b). To overcome these challenges and further investigate the potential of LLMs in complex game *Department of Computer Science, Princeton University; sethkarten@princeton.edu. Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Princeton University; an4978@princeton.edu Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Princeton University; chij@princeton.edu 1 Figure 1: PokéChamp achieves the 70%-90% percentile of players and 1300-1500 Elo rating against real players. Higher Elo and percentile denote better performance. environments, this paper focuses on fast-paced, strategy-rich, and challenging two-player competitive gamePokémon battles. Pokémon battles present unique and formidable challenge for AI systems. With over 1000 Pokémon species, each possessing unique abilities, moves, typing, and stats, the state space complexity is estimated to be on the order of 10354 for the first turn alone (The-Third-Build, 2022). The game features partial observability, where information about the opponents team is gradually revealed through gameplay, maintains this vast search space throughout the battle. Furthermore, Pokémon battles can last anywhere from 6 to over 100 turns, making exhaustive tree search over all possible branches computationally intractable. We argue that an informative prior can help constrain minimax search to the space of human strategies. LLMs, trained on diverse datasets that include Pokémon-related information, offer promising foundation for this approach. To harness the potential of LLMs effectively, we seek to develop an agent capable of: 1. Proposing strategic actions to provide diverse and human-like strategies. 2. Accurately modeling the opponent based on their move history, team composition, and skill level. 3. Evaluating and reflecting internally on planned game trajectories. To achieve these objectives, we introduce PokéChamp, competitive language agent that achieves human-expert level performance in two-player turn-based Pokémon battles. PokéChamp leverages large language model to power minimax tree search algorithm by replacing three of its key modules with LLMs: (1) player action sampling, (2) opponent modeling, and (3) value function estimation. This enables our agent to effectively utilize gameplay history and human knowledge to reduce the search space and tackle partial observability. Within our framework, the LLM functions as black box, allowing for flexibility in selecting any frontier model based on budget and computational resources. Our approach does not require additional training or fine-tuning of LLM on Pokémon-specific data, relying instead on the LLMs pre-existing knowledge and our novel integration with game-theoretic planning algorithms. To enable effective planning, we developed world model that approximates game transition and addresses the challenges of partial observability and intricate game mechanics. This world model incorporates one-step lookahead that mathematically computes core game dynamics and leverages historical data from real player games to estimate likely stats for the opponents team. Our Pokémon battling dataset, containing over 3 2 million games across various skill levels and game modes, provides rich source of information for opponent modeling and strategy development. We evaluate PokéChamp through comprehensive set of experiments designed to assess its performance across various competitive scenarios. Our evaluation includes arena-style comparisons against established Pokémon bots, encompassing both heuristic-based approaches and the state-of-the-art LLM-based agent PokéLLMon (H"

[ 1 0 3 1 4 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) have significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as sequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long videos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for Multimodal LLMs), novel architecture incorporating dedicated temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques, our approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks (more than 5% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the computation costs by up to 8 and the dec"

Text:"The Best of Both Worlds: Integrating Language Models and Diffusion Models for Video Generation Aoxiong Yin * 1 Kai Shen * 2 Yichong Leng 2 Xu Tan 2 Xinyu Zhou 2 Juncheng Li 1 Siliang TangRecent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation have been driven by two competing paradigms: autoregressive language models and diffusion models. However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through coarse-tofine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving 14,000 compression ratio; (2) language model that generates semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) streaming diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos. Experiments show that LanDiff, 5B model, achieves score of 85.43 on the VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art opensource models Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Keling, and Hailuo. Furthermore, our model also achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation, surpassing other open-source models in this field.

Introduction Text-to-video (T2V) (Blattmann et al., 2023; Kondratyuk et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Yang et al., 2024b) has made significant progress in recent years, becoming an important research direction in the fields of computer vision *Equal contribution 1College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China 2Moonshot AI, Beijing, China. Correspondence to: Xu Tan <tanxu@moonshot.cn>, Juncheng Li <junchengli@zju.edu.cn>. Figure 1. The rate-distortion curve illustrates how visual distortion decreases as the number of transmitted bits increases. With just small number of bits representing high-level semantic features, we can already achieve relatively low visual distortion. Building on this information-theoretic insight, LanDiff combines the strengths of both paradigms: LLMs efficiently generate compact semantic features in the first stage, followed by diffusion models that add perceptual details in the second stage, before final decoding to pixels via VAE. Data from Ho et al. (2020), illustration is conceptual. and artificial intelligence. Recent works in T2V models have primarily revolved around two predominant paradigms: autoregressive large language model (LLM)-based (Kondratyuk et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a) frameworks and diffusion-based architectures (Blattmann et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024b). However, each paradigm has their own advantages and limitations, as shown in Table 1. Table 1. The comparison between LLM based and diffusion based T2V systems. The advantages and disadvantages are marked by and Methods , respectively.

The comparison between LanDiff and previous large-scale T2V systems. The compression rates of LLM-based and diffusionbased models are illustrated using VideoPoet (Kondratyuk et al., 2024) and CogVideoX (Yang et al., 2024b) as examples, respectively. LLM Diffusion LanDiff Models Highlight Semantic Information? Progressive Refinement? Causal Modeling? High Visual Quality? Compression Ratio Long video Generation? 256 1024 14000 semantics through vector quantization, effectively prioritizing conceptual abstraction and narrative coherence. However, this discretization inherently sacrifices low-level visual fidelity due to information compression, resulting in low reconstruction quality. In contrast, diffusion-based approaches employ continuous latent representations to preserve much more perceptual details, enabling superior reconstruction quality at the cost of diluted semantic interpretability, as hierarchical features remain entangled in the latent space. From generative modeling perspective, LLM-based systems adopt autoregressive modeling to enforce causal dependencies between video frames, ensuring strong temporal coherence. However, the autoregressive generation inherently risks error propagation across time steps, where inaccuracies in early predictions amplify during decoding. In contrast, diffusion-based methods employ non-autoregressive generation, refining outputs in parallel through iterative denoising steps. Although this design mitigates error accumulation and enhances generation flexibility, the absence of explicit causal constraints often leads to temporal inconsistencies or semantic hallucinations. In this work, we propose hybrid architecture that synergizes the strengths of both Language models and Diffusion models, named LanDiff, through coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. As shown in Figure 1, inspired by the human creation of video which will generate the high-level storyline first and then add low-level visual details based on the storyline to form the video, we design two-stage video generation process with the number of bits gradually increasing and carefully design the autoregressive model and the diffusion model to be responsible for different stages of T2V generation, so as to play to their strengths and avoid their weaknesses. In detail, 1) at the low-bit position semantic feature, the low-bit information ensures that the token sequence is not too long, and the high-level information makes it easier for the model to capture the overall semantic entity motion of the video, so as to play to the strengths of the autoregressive model and avoid its weaknesses. Thus we use LLM to generate coarse-grained video in the first stage; 2 2) at the high-bit position perceptual feature, since we have already obtained the coarse-grained with rich semantic and time-serial information, we only need to "

As large language models are increasingly responsible for online content, concerns arise about the impact of repeatedly processing their own outputs. Inspired by the "broken telephone" effect in chained human communication, this study investigates whether LLMs similarly distort information through iterative generation. Through translation-based experiments, we find that distortion accumulates over time, influenced by language choice and chain complexity. While degradation is inevitable, it can be mitigated through strategic prompting techniques. These findings contribute to discussions on the long-term effects of AI-mediated information propagation, raising important questions about the reliability of LLM-generated content in iterative workflows.

We introduce Pok\'eChamp, a minimax agent powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for Pok\'emon battles. Built on a general framework for two-player competitive games, Pok\'eChamp leverages the generalist capabilities of LLMs to enhance minimax tree search. Specifically, LLMs replace three key modules: (1) player action sampling, (2) opponent modeling, and (3) value function estimation, enabling the agent to effectively utilize gameplay history and human knowledge to reduce the search space and address partial observability. Notably, our framework requires no additional LLM training. We evaluate Pok\'eChamp in the popular Gen 9 OU format. When powered by GPT-4o, it achieves a win rate of 76% against the best existing LLM-based bot and 84% against the strongest rule-based bot, demonstrating its superior performance. Even with an open-source 8-billion-parameter Llama 3.1 model, Pok\'eChamp consistently outperforms the previous best LLM-based bot, Pok\'ellmon powered by GPT-4o, with a 64% win rate. Pok\'eChamp attains a projected Elo of 1300-1500 on the Pok\'emon Showdown online ladder, placing it among the top 30%-10% of human players. In addition, this work compiles the largest real-player Pok\'emon battle dataset, featuring over 3 million games, including more than 500k high-Elo matches. Based on this dataset, we establish a series of battle benchmarks and puzzles to evaluate specific battling skills. We further provide key updates to the local game engine. We hope this work fosters further research that leverage Pok\'emon battle as benchmark to integrate LLM technologies with game-theoretic algorithms addressing general multiagent problems.

Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) have significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as sequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long videos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for Multimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques, our approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks (more than 5\% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the computation costs by up to 8times and the decoding latency by 2.4-2.9times for the fixed numbers of input frames.

However, many existing methods treat frames independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long videos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for Multimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques, our approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks (more than 5\% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the computation costs by up to 8times and the decoding latency by 2.4-2.9times for the fixed numbers of input frames.

Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation have been driven by two competing paradigms: autoregressive language models and diffusion models. However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through coarse-to-fine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) a semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving a sim14,000times compression ratio; (2) a language model that generates semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) a streaming diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos. Experiments show that LanDiff, a 5B model, achieves a score of 85.43 on the VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art open-source models Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Keling, and Hailuo. Furthermore, our model also achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation, surpassing other open-source models in this field. Our demo can be viewed at https://landiff.github.io/.
