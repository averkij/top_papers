INTRODUCTION ixture of Experts (MoE) [1] is an advanced deep learning framework that effectively enhances model efficiency and strengthens its predictive capabilities. This architecture features sophisticated gating mechanism that orchestrates constellation of finely tuned expert networks, each excelling with distinct data subsets. With the dynamic This work was supported by the National Science and Technology Major Project (2022ZD0115502), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52172382, 52472426).

(e-mail: yjyang@mail.dlut.edu.cn; lilinhui@dlut.edu.cn; lianjing@dlut.edu.cn ). allocation mechanism, it can enhance the model's computational efficiency while maintaining an optimal performance. Existing MoE methods are confronted with certain challenges. In terms of performance, they are fundamentally grounded in the concept of ensemble learning [2] . In this manner, dense model is essentially isolated into multiple sub-models. Each sub-model contains an independent subspace, which allows model to learn multiple different representations in parallel across multiple subspaces [3] . However, in this approach, the sub-models can only achieve indirect and limited interaction through downstream aggregator, resulting in relatively insufficient global information exchange capability. From an efficiency perspective, exist MoE methods are primarily applied to MLP blocks. They have not been effectively extended to attention efficiency improvements. Moreover, they seldom succeed in achieving parallel computing, nor in optimizing efficiency based on cuda computing process. block, which constrains further To address the aforementioned issues, we propose Union-ofExperts (UoE). The idea of UoE is inspired and influenced by Megatron-LM [4] which implements an efficient intra-layer model parallelism. We apply this mechanism on MoE method, to decompose both MLPs and attention blocks into several experts while maintaining its intrinsic nature. In this paradigm, each expert evolves to become one part of whole model rather than an individual. The enhanced collaboration promotes collective intelligence and knowledge sharing, which in turn enhances model performance. Fig. 1 illustrates comparison between model parallelism, MoE and our proposed UoE. tensor, thereby effectively exploit We also develop group of routing mechanism, which contains selection strategies for input data and experts. In data selection strategy, we split each input sample into patches, and select no more than patches for each expert as input. In this configuration, expert only receive one part of the sample as locality of input information while maintaining fine-grained data routing strategy. In expert selection strategy, we route each input sample to top of experts. This strategy is conducive to enhancing model stability as activated experts can observe the input sequence in comprehensive view. Combining the two mechanisms allows for dynamically and precisely removing the parts of samples and experts that are not beneficial to final results, which helps to optimize computational efficiency while preserving and even enhancing model performance. the We applied the proposed routing mechanism to equivalent decomposed attention experts and MLP experts to build the fundamental architecture of UoE. UoEs architecture consists of Fig. 1. The comparison between Model Parallelism, Mixture-of-Experts and our proposed Union-of-Experts. Model parallelism partitions the model equivalent modules for distributed computation. Mixture-of-Experts employs multiple independent experts and selectively activates subset for the output. Union-of-Experts integrates the equivalent decomposition strategy of model parallelism into MoE framework, making the activated experts as union equivalent to single model of the same scale. Selective Multi-Head Attention (SMHA) and Union-of-MLPExperts (UoME). SMHA maintains the multi-head design of Multi-Head Attention mechanism, which achieves selective routing mechanism while enabling the model to learn diverse represen"

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enhances model performance while maintaining computational efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. However, expert in exist MoE paradigm works as an individual, thereby lacking high-quality expert interactions. Moreover, they have not been effectively extended to attention block, which constrains further efficiency improvements. To tackle these issues, we propose Union-of-Experts (UoE), which decomposes transformer into an equitant group of experts, and then implement dynamic routing on input data and experts. Our approach advances MoE design with three key innovations: (1) We conducted equitant expert decomposition on both MLP blocks and attention blocks based on matrix partition in tensor parallelism. (2) We developed two routing paradigms: patch wise data selection and expert selection, to apply routing across different levels. (3) We design the architecture of UoE model, including Selective Multi-Head Attention (SMHA) and Union-of-MLP-Experts (UoME). (4) We develop parallel implementation of UoE's routing and computation operation, and optimize efficiency based on the hardware processing analysis. The experiments demonstrate that the model employed with UoE surpass Full Attention, state-of-art MoEs and efficient transformers in several tasks across image and natural language domains. The source codes are available at https://github.com/YujiaoYang-work/UoE.

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in machine translation, demonstrating impressive performance across diverse languages. However, translationese, characterized by overly literal and unnatural translations, remains a persistent challenge in LLM-based translation systems. Despite their pre-training on vast corpora of natural utterances, LLMs exhibit translationese errors and generate unexpected unnatural translations, stemming from biases introduced during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we systematically evaluate the prevalence of translationese in LLM-generated translations and investigate its roots during supervised training. We introduce methods to mitigate these biases, including polishing golden references and filtering unnatural training instances. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that these approaches significantly reduce translationese while improving translation naturalness, validated by human evaluations and automatic metrics. Our findings highlight the need for training-aware adjustments to optimize LLM translation outputs, paving the way for more fluent and target-language-consistent translations. We release the data and code at https://github.com/yafuly/LLM_Translationese.
