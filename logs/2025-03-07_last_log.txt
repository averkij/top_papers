Despite their success, LLMs can generate hallucinated outputsstatements that appear plausible but factually inaccurate or unsupported. Such hallucinations can undermine user trust and lead to potentially harmful consequences, especially in high-stake applications (Zhang et al., 2023; Pal et al., 2023). Therefore, to be truly trustworthy, an LLM must not only generate text that is consistent with user prompts but also possess the ability to detect hallucinations and alert users when they occur. 1Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA 2School of Software Technology, Zhejiang University, China. Correspondence to: Yixuan Li <sharonli@cs.wisc.edu>. Figure 1. T-SNE visualization (Van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008) of the last-token embeddings from the final layer of LLaMA-3.1-8B on the TruthfulQA test set. (a) Pre-trained models embeddings exhibit significant overlap, whereas (b) adding TSV to latent states of an intermediate LLM layer effectively separates the embeddings of truthful and hallucinated data. Recent work has explored leveraging the latent space of LLMs to identify hallucinations (Burns et al., 2023; Azaria & Mitchell, 2023; Marks & Tegmark, 2024; Yin et al., 2024a; Du et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024; Kossen et al., 2024). These approaches typically rely on the embeddings of off-the-shelf LLMs to classify outputs as truthful or hallucinated. However, pre-trained LLMs are optimized for linguistic coherence using next-token prediction objective, often prioritizing fluency and syntactic correctness over factual accuracy (Radford et al., 2019). As result, their internal representations, while powerful for general text generation, can fail to provide clear separation between truthful and hallucinated content (see real-world example in Figure 1a). This motivates key question: How can we shape the latent space of an LLM for hallucination detection? Instead of fine-tuning the LLMs, which is computationally expensive and alters the models parameters (Gekhman et al., 2024), we propose learning lightweight vector, called Truthfulness Separator Vector (TSV). As illustrated in Figure 1b, this learnable vector is introduced during inference and adjusting the internal representations of the LLM to enhance the separation between truthful and hallucinated generations, without modifying the models parameters. TSV focuses on reshaping the latent space for classifying halluci1 How to Steer LLM Latents for Hallucination Detection? nated responses, fundamentally different objective from mitigating hallucinated generations (Li et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b; Marks & Tegmark, 2024). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploration of steering representations for hallucination detection. Learning TSV is appealing yet challenging due to the lack of large-scale human-labeled datasets with truthfulness annotations for LLM generation, which are costly and timeintensive to create. To overcome this, we propose twostage training framework. In the initial stage, small exemplar set of labeled data is used to guide the learning process. The objective in this stage is to encourage the steered embeddings to form compact clusters around class prototypes, representing truthful and hallucinated generations. In the second stage, we augment the training data by leveraging unlabeled LLM generations, which are freely available for deployed LLM systems through user queries and interactions (Du et al., 2024). To assign pseudo-labels to these unlabeled samples, we propose an optimal transportbased algorithm, which aligns unlabeled data embeddings with class prototypes by minimizing transport costs while accounting for the imbalanced class proportions. Furthermore, confidence-based sample selection is then used to include only the most reliable pseudo-labeled samples in the training process. Together, these stages enable TSV to effectively separate truthful and hallucinated representations while significantly reducing the reliance on human labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of our method across diverse datasets. On the challenging TruthfulQA benchmark (Lin et al., 2022a), our approach achieves significant +12.8% improvement in hallucination detection accuracy (AUROC) compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our method reaches performance comparable to the fully-supervised upper bound (e.g., 84.2% vs. 85.5% on TruthfulQA), while using small labeled exemplar set with only 32 examples. TSV also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, maintaining competitive performance when applied to unseen datasets. Our key contributions are summarized as follows: 1. We propose the Truthfulness Separator Vector (TSV), lightweight approach to separate truthful and hallucinated representations without fine-tuning the LLMs, which is largely unexplored in hallucination detection. 2. We develop an optimal transport-based pseudo-labeling framew"

Hallucinations in LLMs pose a significant concern to their safe deployment in real-world applications. Recent approaches have leveraged the latent space of LLMs for hallucination detection, but their embeddings, optimized for linguistic coherence rather than factual accuracy, often fail to clearly separate truthful and hallucinated content. To this end, we propose the Truthfulness Separator Vector (TSV), a lightweight and flexible steering vector that reshapes the LLM's representation space during inference to enhance the separation between truthful and hallucinated outputs, without altering model parameters. Our two-stage framework first trains TSV on a small set of labeled exemplars to form compact and well-separated clusters. It then augments the exemplar set with unlabeled LLM generations, employing an optimal transport-based algorithm for pseudo-labeling combined with a confidence-based filtering process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSV achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data, exhibiting strong generalization across datasets and providing a practical solution for real-world LLM applications.
