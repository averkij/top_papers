Training dynamics for 1.2B dense models with Pre-Norm, HybridNorm and HybridNorm under 1T training tokens. We present the training loss, validation loss, and downstream performance on HellaSwag and ARC-Easy (0.8 EMA smoothed), demonstrating that HybridNorm achieves superior performance. long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms, which have made them the preferred choice for variety of tasks, including language modeling, machine translation, and image processing (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). However, as transformer models become deeper and more complex, ensuring stable training remains significant challenge. One critical factor that influences training stability is the choice of normalization methods, which is crucial for mitigating issues such as internal covariate shift and gradient instability (Xiong et al., 2020). Effectively addressing these challenges is crucial for fully harnessing the potential of deep transformer models in large-scale applications. In transformers, Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) (Ba et al., 2016) plays central role in stabilizing training by normalizing the activations within each layer. The two predominant strategies for applying LayerNorm are Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-Norm) and Post-Layer Normalization HybridNorm: Towards Stable and Efficient Transformer Training via Hybrid Normalization Figure 2. Illustrations of different transformer layer structures: (a) Post-Norm architecture; (b) Pre-Norm architecture; (c) Pre-Norm with QK-Norm architecture; (d) HybridNorm architecture. (Post-Norm), each with its respective benefits and trade-offs. In the Pre-Norm architecture, normalization is applied before the residual addition, resulting in more prominent identity path that facilitates faster convergence and more stable gradients (Xiong et al., 2020). This design is particularly advantageous when training deep models, as it helps mitigate gradient-related issues that can arise during backpropagation. However, while Pre-Norm can stabilize training, it often leads to inferior final performance compared to Post-Norm (Xie et al., 2023). In contrast, PostNorm applies normalization after the residual connection, resulting in stronger regularization effects, which contribute to improved model performance. This approach has been shown to improve the generalization ability of transformers, particularly in very deep networks (Wang et al., 2024). Despite the benefits of each approach, there is an inherent trade-off between training stability and final model performance. Pre-Norm structures typically stabilize training but may underperform in terms of generalization, while PostNorm architectures provide better performance but can be more difficult to train, especially in deep models. To reconcile these trade-offs, we propose hybrid normalization method that applies QKV normalization in the attention mechanism and Post-Norm in the feed-forward network (FFN), which is named as HybridNorm. The QKV normalization in the attention mechanism stabilizes the flow of information between layers by normalizing the query, key, and value components, while Post-Norm in the FFN ensures effective depth in the deeper layers of the transformer. Through extensive experiments on large-scale models, we validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results show that the hybrid normalization method significantly outperforms both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm across multiple benchmarks, providing stable training process and improved model performance. Specifically, our method achieves superior results in the context of LLMs, where the benefits of both normalization schemes are most pronounced. We believe that this hybrid approach offers promising solution for enhancing the training stability and performance of deep transformer architectures, particularly in the rapidly evolving field of LLMs. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. We propose HybridNorm, novel hybrid normalization structure that combines the advantages of Pre-Norm and Post-Norm, offering simple yet effective solution to enhancing performance in large transformer models. Our method is designed to exploit the strengths of both normalization approaches, ensuring robust convergence during training and superior final performance. We provide an empirical analysis of the proposed hybrid normalization method, demonstrating its potential benefits in terms of gradient flow stability, regularization effects, and model robu"

Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks through the utilization of long Chain-of-thought (CoT). However, these models often suffer from hallucinations and inefficiencies due to their reliance solely on internal reasoning processes. In this paper, we introduce START (Self-Taught Reasoner with Tools), a novel tool-integrated long CoT reasoning LLM that significantly enhances reasoning capabilities by leveraging external tools. Through code execution, START is capable of performing complex computations, self-checking, exploring diverse methods, and self-debugging, thereby addressing the limitations of LRMs. The core innovation of START lies in its self-learning framework, which comprises two key techniques: 1) Hint-infer: We demonstrate that inserting artificially designed hints (e.g., ``Wait, maybe using Python here is a good idea.'') during the inference process of a LRM effectively stimulates its ability to utilize external tools without the need for any demonstration data. Hint-infer can also serve as a simple and effective sequential test-time scaling method; 2) Hint Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (Hint-RFT): Hint-RFT combines Hint-infer and RFT by scoring, filtering, and modifying the reasoning trajectories with tool invocation generated by a LRM via Hint-infer, followed by fine-tuning the LRM. Through this framework, we have fine-tuned the QwQ-32B model to achieve START. On PhD-level science QA (GPQA), competition-level math benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24, AIME25), and the competition-level code benchmark (LiveCodeBench), START achieves accuracy rates of 63.6%, 95.0%, 66.7%, 47.1%, and 47.3%, respectively. It significantly outperforms the base QwQ-32B and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art open-weight model R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and the proprietary model o1-Preview.

"Transformers have become the de facto architecture for a wide range of machine learning tasks, particularly in large language models (LLMs). Despite their remarkable performance, challenges remain in training deep transformer networks, especially regarding the location of layer normalization. While Pre-Norm structures facilitate easier training due to their more prominent identity path, they often yield suboptimal performance compared to Post-Norm. In this paper, we propose HybridNorm, a straightforward yet effective hybrid normalization strategy that integrates the advantages of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches. Specifically, HybridNorm employs QKV normalization within the attention mechanism and Post-Norm in the feed-forward network (FFN) of each transformer block. This design not only stabilizes training but also enhances performance, particularly in the context of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments in both dense and sparse architectures show that HybridNorm consistently outperforms both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of HybridNorm as a more stable and effective technique for improving the training and performance of deep transformer models. %Code will be made publicly available. Code is available at https://github.com/BryceZhuo/HybridNorm."
