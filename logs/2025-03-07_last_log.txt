To address the key technical challenges of 1) developing robust visual-audio models for egocentric data, 2) enabling identity recognition, and 3) facilitating long-context question answering over extensive temporal information, we introduce EgoBulter, an integrated system comprising EgoGPT and EgoRAG. EgoGPT is an omni-modal model trained on egocentric datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on egocentric video understanding. EgoRAG is retrievalbased component that supports answering ultra-long-context questions. Our experimental studies verify their working mechanisms and reveal critical factors and bottlenecks, guiding future improvements. By releasing our datasets, models, and benchmarks, we aim to stimulate further research in egocentric AI assistants. 1 1. Introduction Imagine future where an AI assistant seamlessly integrates into daily life, offering personalized food suggestions based on your habits and reminding you of purchases made after work, all through comprehensive analysis of your potential needs not only from your activities but also those of your family. Such an assistant would greatly enhance both personal and interpersonal efficiency, offering meaningful, life-oriented assistance and delivering actionable insights. Realizing this vision requires significant advancements in understanding ultra-long-term behavior patterns and the intricate dynamics of social interactionsareas where current egocentric vision systems and datasets still fall short [2, 3]. While existing datasets like Epic-Kitchen [4] and Ego4D [5] support numerous valuable tasks, they are limited by relatively short recording durations and predominantly monographic perspective. These limitations hinder their ability to capture comprehensive habits and the intricate dynamics of social interactions. Overcoming these challenges requires dataset that spans extended activities, integrates multimodal data, and incorporates multi-person perspectives to reflect the complexity of real-life experiences. In response to these challenges, we initiated the Project EgoLife. As shown in Figure 1, over one week, six participants shared fully instrumented living environment, recording approximately eight hours of egocentric multimodal video daily using Meta Aria glasses [1]. This resulted in the EgoLife dataset, rich 300-hour collection of egocentric, multimodal, and multi-view data, augmented with synchronized third-person perspectives captured from 15 additional cameras [6] and two mmWave devices [7] (see Figure 2 showing their arrangements). The dataset provides an unprecedented resource for studying long-duration activities, interpersonal dynamics, and contextual interactions, with rich annotations including audio transcript and visualaudio narrations at various time granularity. Building on the EgoLife dataset, we introduce the EgoLifeQA benchmark, set of long-context, life-oriented Figure 2. 3D reconstruction of the shared house using Aria MultiMPS [1], showcasing the locations of 15 Exo cameras in the common area and 2 mmWave devices (highlighted in red) on the second floor. Color-coded 10-minute participant traces are also displayed. 2 question-answering tasks that assess the effectiveness of personalized AI assistance. These tasks address practical, everyday needs such as locating misplaced items, recalling past events, tracking health habits, analyzing social interactions, and making timely recommendations. By enabling contextaware responses to questions like Where are the scissors, and who used them last?, How much water did consume today?, or Based on todays consumption, what should purchase or restock later?, EgoLifeQA aims to inspire methods that provide intelligent, anticipatory support, simplifying daily activities and enhancing the user experience. Addressing the novel tasks posed by the EgoLifeQA requires innovative technical contributions to tackle key challenges: 1) developing robust omni-modal models that integrate both visual and audio data specifically for egocentric contexts, 2) achieving accurate recognition and tracking of individuals, and 3) enabling ultra-long-context (weeklevel) question answering over extensive temporal sequences. To meet these objectives, we present EgoButler, an integrated system comprising EgoGPT, lightweight personalized vision-audio-language model fine-tuned on egocentric datasets for state-of-the-art multimodal video understanding, and EgoRAG - retrieval-augmented generation module supports long-context question answering. Our comprehensive evaluations identify crucial factors and highlight existing bottlenecks, offering valuable insights and paving the"

Next, for the first time, we extend audio understanding to long audio segments (30 secs to 5 mins) and propose LongAudio, large and novel dataset for training ALMs on long audio captioning and question-answering tasks. Finetuning AF2 on LongAudio leads to exceptional performance on our proposed LongAudioBench, an expert annotated benchmark for evaluating ALMs on long audio understanding capabilities.

Introduction Understanding non-speech sounds, non-verbal speech, and music (collectively referred to as audio in this paper) is essential for real-world applications such as detecting anomalies in industrial environments, recognizing emotional cues, and improving assistive technologies for the impaired.

Figure 1: Audio Flamingo 2 versus previous SOTA ALMs on audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks (values normalized). AF2 outperforms all baselines and has smaller model footprints. demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through language, extending these systems to comprehend audio is key to building intelligent systems capable of reasoning with contextual auditory cues (Kong et al., 2024). Verbal speech, inherently tied to language, benefits significantly from (L)LM advancements (Watanabe et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2024a); however, the potential to enhance perception and reasoning over non-verbal audio remains largely underexplored (Ghosh et al., 2024c). Audio-Language Models (ALMs) extend language models with audio understanding capabilities. Contrastive Language-Audio Pre-training (CLAP) (Elizalde et al., 2023a) was among the first encoderonly ALMs to bridge audio and language with contrastive learning. Building on this, subsequent efforts introduced Large ALMs (LALMs), which integrate audio encoders with pre-trained decoder-based LLMs, enabling open-ended Audio Question Answering (AQA) and free-form response generation (Gong et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2024; Ghosh et al., 2024c). However, despite these developments, even the most advanced LALMs continue to underperform on expertlevel reasoning tasks compared to foundational tasks like event classification. For example, Gemini-1.5-Pro (Team et al., 2024), one of the most advanced models, achieves only 54.4% and 48.5% on the MMAU sound and music Audio Flamingo 2: An Audio-Language Model with Long-Audio Understanding and Expert Reasoning Abilities subsets (Sakshi et al., 2024), benchmark for evaluating expert-level audio reasoning. This underscores the challenges of improving an LLMs ability to understand and reason over audio, which we attribute to the lack of highquality training data and robust audio representations. Main Contributions: In this paper, we propose Audio Flamingo 2 (AF2), parameter-efficient ALM that combines 3B-parameter small decoder LM with 203Mparameter audio encoder, achieving state-of-the-art audio understanding and reasoning capabilities. There are three major innovations in our method: (1) Data: Recent studies highlight that improving data quality can rival or even surpass the performance gains achieved by scaling compute and model size (Abdin et al., 2024). To this end, we propose AudioSkills (Section 4.1), large-scale, skill-specific AQA training dataset featuring complex, reasoning-intensive questions paired with each audio. We design questions that target seven distinct skills, with the primary aim of improving finegrained reasoning capabilities in ALMs. (2) Audio Encoding: We propose AF-CLAP (Section 3.1), where we scale CLAP training to over 8M audio-caption pairs, incorporating synthetic data, and propose an improved contrastive loss for better representational quality and robustness. (3) Training Strategy: We propose novel 3-stage curriculum training strategy (Section 5) for improved performance. Additionally, for the first time, we extend audio understanding to long audios, moving beyond 30-second clips to audios lasting up to 5 minutes. To enable the model to comprehend and reason over long audio, we introduce LongAudio, novel dataset comprising over 260k carefully curated AQA instances with audios ranging from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. LongAudio spans 10+ audio categories and supports 6 tasks, including captioning and 5 reasoning-based QA tasks. Next, we introduce LongAudioBench, an expert-annotated benchmark for evaluating ALMs on long audio understanding. AF2, trained on LongAudio, significantly outperforms our baseline. In summary, our main contributions are: 1. We present Audio Flamingo 2, SOTA ALM with advanced audio understanding and reasoning capabilities. 2. We propose innovations in data generation, architecture design, representation learning, and training strategies. 3. We introduce the long audio understanding task and create dedicated training and evaluation datasets to drive progress in this area. 4. Audio Flamingo 2 outperforms larger and proprietary LALMs across over 20 benchmarks, despite being smaller and trained exclusively on public datasets. 5. We conduct systematic ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of each design choice. 2.

However, toxic language and negative interactions can hinder the participation and retention of contributors and alienate newcomers. Proactive moderation strategies aim to prevent toxicity from occurring by addressing conversations that have derailed from their intended purpose. This study aims to understand and predict conversational derailment leading to toxicity on GitHub. To facilitate this research, we curate novel dataset comprising 202 toxic conversations from GitHub with annotated derailment points, along with 696 non-toxic conversations as baseline. Based on this dataset, we identify unique characteristics of toxic conversations and derailment points, including linguistic markers such as second-person pronouns, negation terms, and tones of Bitter Frustration and Impatience, as well as patterns in conversational dynamics between project contributors and external participants. Leveraging these empirical observations, we propose proactive moderation approach to automatically detect and address potentially harmful conversations before escalation. By utilizing modern LLMs, we develop conversation trajectory summary technique that captures the evolution of discussions and identifies early signs of derailment.

We introduce EgoLife, a project to develop an egocentric life assistant that accompanies and enhances personal efficiency through AI-powered wearable glasses. To lay the foundation for this assistant, we conducted a comprehensive data collection study where six participants lived together for one week, continuously recording their daily activities - including discussions, shopping, cooking, socializing, and entertainment - using AI glasses for multimodal egocentric video capture, along with synchronized third-person-view video references. This effort resulted in the EgoLife Dataset, a comprehensive 300-hour egocentric, interpersonal, multiview, and multimodal daily life dataset with intensive annotation. Leveraging this dataset, we introduce EgoLifeQA, a suite of long-context, life-oriented question-answering tasks designed to provide meaningful assistance in daily life by addressing practical questions such as recalling past relevant events, monitoring health habits, and offering personalized recommendations. To address the key technical challenges of (1) developing robust visual-audio models for egocentric data, (2) enabling identity recognition, and (3) facilitating long-context question answering over extensive temporal information, we introduce EgoButler, an integrated system comprising EgoGPT and EgoRAG. EgoGPT is an omni-modal model trained on egocentric datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on egocentric video understanding. EgoRAG is a retrieval-based component that supports answering ultra-long-context questions. Our experimental studies verify their working mechanisms and reveal critical factors and bottlenecks, guiding future improvements. By releasing our datasets, models, and benchmarks, we aim to stimulate further research in egocentric AI assistants.

Understanding and reasoning over non-speech sounds and music are crucial for both humans and AI agents to interact effectively with their environments. In this paper, we introduce Audio Flamingo 2 (AF2), an Audio-Language Model (ALM) with advanced audio understanding and reasoning capabilities. AF2 leverages (i) a custom CLAP model, (ii) synthetic Audio QA data for fine-grained audio reasoning, and (iii) a multi-stage curriculum learning strategy. AF2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a 3B parameter small language model, surpassing large open-source and proprietary models across over 20 benchmarks. Next, for the first time, we extend audio understanding to long audio segments (30 secs to 5 mins) and propose LongAudio, a large and novel dataset for training ALMs on long audio captioning and question-answering tasks. Fine-tuning AF2 on LongAudio leads to exceptional performance on our proposed LongAudioBench, an expert annotated benchmark for evaluating ALMs on long audio understanding capabilities. We conduct extensive ablation studies to confirm the efficacy of our approach. Project Website: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/AF2/.

Software projects thrive on the involvement and contributions of individuals from different backgrounds. However, toxic language and negative interactions can hinder the participation and retention of contributors and alienate newcomers. Proactive moderation strategies aim to prevent toxicity from occurring by addressing conversations that have derailed from their intended purpose. This study aims to understand and predict conversational derailment leading to toxicity on GitHub.   To facilitate this research, we curate a novel dataset comprising 202 toxic conversations from GitHub with annotated derailment points, along with 696 non-toxic conversations as a baseline. Based on this dataset, we identify unique characteristics of toxic conversations and derailment points, including linguistic markers such as second-person pronouns, negation terms, and tones of Bitter Frustration and Impatience, as well as patterns in conversational dynamics between project contributors and external participants.   Leveraging these empirical observations, we propose a proactive moderation approach to automatically detect and address potentially harmful conversations before escalation. By utilizing modern LLMs, we develop a conversation trajectory summary technique that captures the evolution of discussions and identifies early signs of derailment. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM prompts tailored to provide summaries of GitHub conversations achieve 69% F1-Score in predicting conversational derailment, strongly improving over a set of baseline approaches.

"Software projects thrive on the involvement and contributions of individuals from different backgrounds. However, toxic language and negative interactions can hinder the participation and retention of contributors and alienate newcomers. Proactive moderation strategies aim to prevent toxicity from occurring by addressing conversations that have derailed from their intended purpose. This study aims to understand and predict conversational derailment leading to toxicity on GitHub.   To facilitate this research, we curate a novel dataset comprising 202 toxic conversations from GitHub with annotated derailment points, along with 696 non-toxic conversations as a baseline. Based on this dataset, we identify unique characteristics of toxic conversations and derailment points, including linguistic markers such as second-person pronouns, negation terms, and tones of Bitter Frustration and Impatience, as well as patterns in conversational dynamics between project contributors and external participants.   Leveraging these empirical observations, we propose a proactive moderation approach to automatically detect and address potentially harmful conversations before escalation. By utilizing modern LLMs, we develop a conversation trajectory summary technique that captures the evolution of discussions and identifies early signs of derailment. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM prompts tailored to provide summaries of GitHub conversations achieve 69% F1-Score in predicting conversational derailment, strongly improving over a set of baseline approaches."
