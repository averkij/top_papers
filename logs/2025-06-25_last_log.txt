The created animation, spanning various categories including humanoids, animals, and fictional models, demonstrates the versatility of our method. Selected models are visualized with keyframes of their predicted animations on the conveyor belts. We present AnimaX, feed-forward 3D animation framework that bridges the motion priors of video diffusion models with the controllable structure of skeleton-based animation. Traditional motion synthesis methods are either restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents Project leader.

We introduce shared positional encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via inverse kinematics. Trained on newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering scalable solution for category-agnostic 3D animation.

Researchers propose design principles for cascaded video super-resolution models to improve high-resolution video generation by introduces degradation strategies, timestep sampling, noise augmentation, and interleaving temporal units with sparse local attention.  					AI-generated summary 				 Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

"Researchers propose design principles for cascaded video super-resolution models to improve high-resolution video generation by introduces degradation strategies, timestep sampling, noise augmentation, and interleaving temporal units with sparse local attention.  					AI-generated summary 				 Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems."
