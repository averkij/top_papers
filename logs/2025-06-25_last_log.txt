Text:"USAD: Universal Speech and Audio Representation via Distillation Heng-Jui Chang, Saurabhchand Bhati, James Glass, Alexander H. Liu MIT CSAIL Cambridge, MA, USA hengjui@mit.edu 5 2 0 2 3 2 ] . [ 1 3 4 8 8 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r AbstractSelf-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized audio representations, yet models often remain domain-specific, focusing on either speech or non-speech tasks. In this work, we present Universal Speech and Audio Distillation (USAD), unified approach to audio representation learning that integrates diverse audio typesspeech, sound, and musicinto single model. USAD employs efficient layer-to-layer distillation from domain-specific SSL models to train student on comprehensive audio dataset. USAD offers competitive performance across various benchmarks and datasets, including frame and instance-level speech processing tasks, audio tagging, and sound classification, achieving near state-of-the-art results with single encoder on SUPERB and HEAR benchmarks.1 Index Termsspeech and audio representation learning, selfsupervised learning, knowledge distillation I. INTRODUCTION In recent years, self-supervised learning (SSL) methodslearning frameworks that utilize unlabeled data without explicit supervisionhave significantly advanced representation learning for audio processing. Speech SSL models like wav2vec 2.0 [1], HuBERT [2], and WavLM [3] have become the foundation of many applications like automatic speech recognition (ASR), speaker identification, and phoneme classification. In parallel, SSL approaches developed for audio event classification and music understanding, such as SSAST [4], BEATs [5], and MERT [6], have successfully been shown to be effective in non-speech tasks. In practice, the use of audio representation has extended beyond simple downstream tasks. These representations have become the proxy for modern multimodal systems to understand the world and to interact with humans through audio. For example, many audio-enabled large languag"

AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

KnowRL, a knowledge-enhanced reinforcement learning approach, reduces hallucinations in slow-thinking large language models by incorporating factuality rewards based on knowledge verification during training.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries.

USAD integrates diverse audio types using efficient layer-to-layer distillation from domain-specific models, achieving competitive performance across various benchmarks with a single encoder.  					AI-generated summary 				 Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized audio representations, yet models often remain domain-specific, focusing on either speech or non-speech tasks. In this work, we present Universal Speech and Audio Distillation (USAD), a unified approach to audio representation learning that integrates diverse audio types - speech, sound, and music - into a single model. USAD employs efficient layer-to-layer distillation from domain-specific SSL models to train a student on a comprehensive audio dataset. USAD offers competitive performance across various benchmarks and datasets, including frame and instance-level speech processing tasks, audio tagging, and sound classification, achieving near state-of-the-art results with a single encoder on SUPERB and HEAR benchmarks.

JarvisArt, an MLLM-driven agent, achieves superior photo retouching by understanding user intent and coordinating multiple retouching tools in Lightroom, outperforming GPT-4o on a novel benchmark.  					AI-generated summary 				 Photo retouching has become integral to contemporary visual storytelling, enabling users to capture aesthetics and express creativity. While professional tools such as Adobe Lightroom offer powerful capabilities, they demand substantial expertise and manual effort. In contrast, existing AI-based solutions provide automation but often suffer from limited adjustability and poor generalization, failing to meet diverse and personalized editing needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process of professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching tools within Lightroom. JarvisArt undergoes a two-stage training process: an initial Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning to establish basic reasoning and tool-use skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for Retouching (GRPO-R) to further enhance its decision-making and tool proficiency. We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate seamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop MMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits. JarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and fine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new avenue for intelligent photo retouching. Notably, it outperforms GPT-4o with a 60% improvement in average pixel-level metrics on MMArt-Bench for content fidelity, while maintaining comparable instruction-following capabilities.
