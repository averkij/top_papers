LLMs struggle to predict human annotation disagreements, contrary to their performance in predicting majority labels, and RLVR-style reasoning exacerbates this issue.  					AI-generated summary 				 Human annotation variation (i.e., annotation disagreements) is common in NLP and often reflects important information such as task subjectivity and sample ambiguity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for automatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on predicting the majority-voted "ground truth" labels. It is still unclear, however, whether these models also capture informative human annotation variation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability to predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels. Our results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style (Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM performance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction. Our findings highlight the critical need for evaluating and improving LLM annotators in disagreement modeling. Code and data at https://github.com/EdisonNi-hku/Disagreement_Prediction.

Авторы обнаружили, что LLM испытывают трудности с моделированием разногласий, несмотря на их хорошую производительность в предсказании меток большинства. Интересно, что методы рассуждения в стиле RLVR (обучение с подкреплением с проверяемыми вознаграждениями) ухудшают способность моделей предсказывать разногласия. Исследование подчеркивает важность оценки и улучшения LLM в моделировании разногласий при автоматической аннотации.",

"LLMs struggle to predict human annotation disagreements, contrary to their performance in predicting majority labels, and RLVR-style reasoning exacerbates this issue.  					AI-generated summary 				 Human annotation variation (i.e., annotation disagreements) is common in NLP and often reflects important information such as task subjectivity and sample ambiguity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for automatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on predicting the majority-voted "ground truth" labels. It is still unclear, however, whether these models also capture informative human annotation variation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability to predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels. Our results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style (Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM performance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction. Our findings highlight the critical need for evaluating and improving LLM annotators in disagreement modeling. Code and data at https://github.com/EdisonNi-hku/Disagreement_Prediction."
