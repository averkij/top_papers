Text:"Xun Liu Faculty of Education Shinawatra University Bangkok, Thailand lxhkj2011@gmail.com Xiaobin Wu School of AutomotiveEngineering Chengdu Industry And Trade College Chengdu, China wuxiaobin@cdgmxy.edu.cn Jiaqi He Tilburg School of Social and Behavioral Sciences Tilburg university Tilburg, The Netherlands hjqhejiaqi@gmail.com Rajan Das Gupta Department of Computer Science and Engineering Jahangirnagar University Dhaka, Bangladesh rajandasgupta.me@gmail.com AbstractThis study explores the effectiveness of predictive intelligent maintenance models and the optimization of Operation and Maintenance (O&M) systems in improving wind power generation efficiency. Through qualitative research, structured interviews were conducted with five wind farm engineers and maintenance managers, each with extensive experience in turbine operations. Using thematic analysis, the study revealed that while predictive maintenance models effectively reduce downtime by identifying major faults, they struggle with detecting smaller, gradual failures. Key challenges, such as false positives, sensor malfunctions, and the integration of new models with older turbines, were also identified. Advanced technologies like digital twins, SCADA systems, and condition monitoring have enhanced turbine maintenance but require further improvements, particularly in AI refinement and real-time data integration. The findings highlight the need for continued development to optimize wind turbine performance and support the broader adoption of renewable energy. Keywordspredictive model, intelligent O&M systems, wind turbine efficiency, Affordable and clean energy I. INTRODUCTION Wind energy is one of the most important sources of renewable energy used to mitigate the climate change effects; however, increasing the efficiency of the wind turbines is still an engineering issue. It has been found that predictive maintenance where machine learning and data analytics are used has the potential of making huge difference"

This study explores the effectiveness of predictive maintenance models and the optimization of intelligent Operation and Maintenance (O&M) systems in improving wind power generation efficiency. Through qualitative research, structured interviews were conducted with five wind farm engineers and maintenance managers, each with extensive experience in turbine operations. Using thematic analysis, the study revealed that while predictive maintenance models effectively reduce downtime by identifying major faults, they often struggle with detecting smaller, gradual failures. Key challenges identified include false positives, sensor malfunctions, and difficulties in integrating new models with older turbine systems. Advanced technologies such as digital twins, SCADA systems, and condition monitoring have significantly enhanced turbine maintenance practices. However, these technologies still require improvements, particularly in AI refinement and real-time data integration. The findings emphasize the need for continuous development to fully optimize wind turbine performance and support the broader adoption of renewable energy.

Mem4Nav enhances Vision-and-Language Navigation by integrating a hierarchical spatial-cognition system with dual-memory modules using a reversible Transformer for improved task completion, speed, and detour detection.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce Mem4Nav, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Mem4Nav.
