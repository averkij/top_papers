Lookahead Reasoning enhances the speed of speculative decoding by introducing step-level parallelism, improving speedup over token-level decoding while maintaining answer quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the resulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD) helps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire gamma-token guess is correct falls exponentially as gamma grows. This means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step, and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching. In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other benchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x while preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional GPU throughput.

Этот подход вводит параллелизм на уровне шагов рассуждения, что позволяет преодолеть ограничения токен-уровневого спекулятивного декодирования. Lookahead Reasoning использует легковесную модель для предложения нескольких будущих шагов, которые затем обрабатываются целевой моделью параллельно. Метод показал увеличение ускорения с 1.4x до 2.1x на различных бенчмарках, сохраняя при этом качество ответов.",
