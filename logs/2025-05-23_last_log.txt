Text:"5 2 0 2 2 2 ] . [ 1 1 5 1 6 1 . 5 0 5 2 : r Training-Free Reasoning and Reflection in MLLMs Hongchen Wei1 and Zhenzhong Chen*1 1School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University Abstract Recent advances in Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o1) have showcased impressive reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning. However, extending these capabilities to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is hampered by the prohibitive costs of retraining and the scarcity of high-quality, verifiable multimodal reasoning datasets. This paper introduces FRANK Model, training-FRee ANd r1-liKe MLLM that imbues off-the-shelf MLLMs with reasoning and reflection abilities, without any gradient updates or extra supervision. Our key insight is to decouple perception and reasoning across MLLM decoder layers. Specifically, we observe that compared to the deeper decoder layers, the shallow decoder layers allocate more attention to visual tokens, while the deeper decoder layers concentrate on textual semantics. This observation motivates hierarchical weight merging approach that combines visual-pretrained MLLM with reasoning-specialized LLM. To this end, we propose layer-wise, Taylor-derived closed-form fusion mechanism that integrates reasoning capacity into deep decoder layers while preserving visual grounding in shallow decoder layers. Extensive experiments on challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the MMMU benchmark, our model FRANK-38B achieves an accuracy of 69.2, outperforming the strongest baseline InternVL2.5-38B by +5.3, and even surpasses the proprietary GPT-4o model. Our project homepage is at: http://iip.whu.edu.cn/frank/index.html Recent reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) [1, 2, 3, 4] such as DeepSeek-R1 [1] and OpenAI-o1 [5] have demonstrated strong performance in tasks requiring complex logic, including math reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and program synthesis.

Tool-Star, an RL-based framework, enables LLMs to autonomously use multiple tools for stepwise reasoning, leveraging data synthesis and hierarchical reward design.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). However, leveraging the RL algorithm to empower effective multi-tool collaborative reasoning in LLMs remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tool-Star, an RL-based framework designed to empower LLMs to autonomously invoke multiple external tools during stepwise reasoning. Tool-Star integrates six types of tools and incorporates systematic designs in both data synthesis and training. To address the scarcity of tool-use data, we propose a general tool-integrated reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which combines tool-integrated prompting with hint-based sampling to automatically and scalably generate tool-use trajectories. A subsequent quality normalization and difficulty-aware classification process filters out low-quality samples and organizes the dataset from easy to hard. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework to enhance multi-tool collaborative reasoning by: (1) cold-start fine-tuning, which guides LLMs to explore reasoning patterns via tool-invocation feedback; and (2) a multi-tool self-critic RL algorithm with hierarchical reward design, which reinforces reward understanding and promotes effective tool collaboration. Experimental analyses on over 10 challenging reasoning benchmarks highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of Tool-Star. The code is available at https://github.com/dongguanting/Tool-Star.

"Tool-Star, an RL-based framework, enables LLMs to autonomously use multiple tools for stepwise reasoning, leveraging data synthesis and hierarchical reward design.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). However, leveraging the RL algorithm to empower effective multi-tool collaborative reasoning in LLMs remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tool-Star, an RL-based framework designed to empower LLMs to autonomously invoke multiple external tools during stepwise reasoning. Tool-Star integrates six types of tools and incorporates systematic designs in both data synthesis and training. To address the scarcity of tool-use data, we propose a general tool-integrated reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which combines tool-integrated prompting with hint-based sampling to automatically and scalably generate tool-use trajectories. A subsequent quality normalization and difficulty-aware classification process filters out low-quality samples and organizes the dataset from easy to hard. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework to enhance multi-tool collaborative reasoning by: (1) cold-start fine-tuning, which guides LLMs to explore reasoning patterns via tool-invocation feedback; and (2) a multi-tool self-critic RL algorithm with hierarchical reward design, which reinforces reward understanding and promotes effective tool collaboration. Experimental analyses on over 10 challenging reasoning benchmarks highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of Tool-Star. The code is available at https://github.com/dongguanting/Tool-Star."

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by optimizing their policies with reward signals. Yet, RL's success relies on the reliability of rewards, which are provided by verifiers. In this paper, we expose and analyze a widespread problem--false negatives--where verifiers wrongly reject correct model outputs. Our in-depth study of the Big-Math-RL-Verified dataset reveals that over 38% of model-generated responses suffer from false negatives, where the verifier fails to recognize correct answers. We show, both empirically and theoretically, that these false negatives severely impair RL training by depriving the model of informative gradient signals and slowing convergence. To mitigate this, we propose tinyV, a lightweight LLM-based verifier that augments existing rule-based methods, which dynamically identifies potential false negatives and recovers valid responses to produce more accurate reward estimates. Across multiple math-reasoning benchmarks, integrating TinyV boosts pass rates by up to 10% and accelerates convergence relative to the baseline. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing verifier false negatives and offer a practical approach to improve RL-based fine-tuning of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/uw-nsl/TinyV.

LaViDa, a family of vision-language models built on discrete diffusion models, offers competitive performance on multimodal benchmarks with advantages in speed, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve a wide range of tasks requiring visual reasoning. In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR) VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling. While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR VLMs. Code and models will be released in the camera-ready version.

Recent advances in multi-modal generative models have enabled significant progress in instruction-based image editing. However, while these models produce visually plausible outputs, their capacity for knowledge-based reasoning editing tasks remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce KRIS-Bench (Knowledge-based Reasoning in Image-editing Systems Benchmark), a diagnostic benchmark designed to assess models through a cognitively informed lens. Drawing from educational theory, KRIS-Bench categorizes editing tasks across three foundational knowledge types: Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural. Based on this taxonomy, we design 22 representative tasks spanning 7 reasoning dimensions and release 1,267 high-quality annotated editing instances. To support fine-grained evaluation, we propose a comprehensive protocol that incorporates a novel Knowledge Plausibility metric, enhanced by knowledge hints and calibrated through human studies. Empirical results on 10 state-of-the-art models reveal significant gaps in reasoning performance, highlighting the need for knowledge-centric benchmarks to advance the development of intelligent image editing systems.

The FRANK Model enhances multimodal LLMs with reasoning and reflection abilities without retraining, using a hierarchical weight merging approach that merges visual-pretrained and reasoning-specialized models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o1) have showcased impressive reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning. However, extending these capabilities to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is hampered by the prohibitive costs of retraining and the scarcity of high-quality, verifiable multimodal reasoning datasets. This paper introduces FRANK Model, a training-FRee ANd r1-liKe MLLM that imbues off-the-shelf MLLMs with reasoning and reflection abilities, without any gradient updates or extra supervision. Our key insight is to decouple perception and reasoning across MLLM decoder layers. Specifically, we observe that compared to the deeper decoder layers, the shallow decoder layers allocate more attention to visual tokens, while the deeper decoder layers concentrate on textual semantics. This observation motivates a hierarchical weight merging approach that combines a visual-pretrained MLLM with a reasoning-specialized LLM. To this end, we propose a layer-wise, Taylor-derived closed-form fusion mechanism that integrates reasoning capacity into deep decoder layers while preserving visual grounding in shallow decoder layers. Extensive experiments on challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the MMMU benchmark, our model FRANK-38B achieves an accuracy of 69.2, outperforming the strongest baseline InternVL2.5-38B by +5.3, and even surpasses the proprietary GPT-4o model.

An empirical analysis of MathIF identifies a tension between enhancing reasoning capacity and maintaining instruction adherence in large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Instruction-following is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user intent. While recent reasoning-oriented models exhibit impressive performance on complex mathematical problems, their ability to adhere to natural language instructions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MathIF, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating instruction-following in mathematical reasoning tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals a consistent tension between scaling up reasoning capacity and maintaining controllability, as models that reason more effectively often struggle to comply with user directives. We find that models tuned on distilled long chains-of-thought or trained with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning often degrade in instruction adherence, especially when generation length increases. Furthermore, we show that even simple interventions can partially recover obedience, though at the cost of reasoning performance. These findings highlight a fundamental tension in current LLM training paradigms and motivate the need for more instruction-aware reasoning models. We release the code and data at https://github.com/TingchenFu/MathIF.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in fine-tuning-as-a-service (FTaaS) settings, where user-submitted datasets adapt general-purpose models to downstream tasks. This flexibility, however, introduces serious security risks, as malicious fine-tuning can implant backdoors into MLLMs with minimal effort. In this paper, we observe that backdoor triggers systematically disrupt cross-modal processing by causing abnormal attention concentration on non-semantic regions--a phenomenon we term attention collapse. Based on this insight, we propose Believe Your Eyes (BYE), a data filtering framework that leverages attention entropy patterns as self-supervised signals to identify and filter backdoor samples. BYE operates via a three-stage pipeline: (1) extracting attention maps using the fine-tuned model, (2) computing entropy scores and profiling sensitive layers via bimodal separation, and (3) performing unsupervised clustering to remove suspicious samples. Unlike prior defenses, BYE equires no clean supervision, auxiliary labels, or model modifications. Extensive experiments across various datasets, models, and diverse trigger types validate BYE's effectiveness: it achieves near-zero attack success rates while maintaining clean-task performance, offering a robust and generalizable solution against backdoor threats in MLLMs.

QuickVideo accelerates long-video understanding by combining a parallelized video decoder, memory-efficient prefilling, and overlapping video decoding with inference, enabling real-time performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-video understanding has emerged as a crucial capability in real-world applications such as video surveillance, meeting summarization, educational lecture analysis, and sports broadcasting. However, it remains computationally prohibitive for VideoLLMs, primarily due to two bottlenecks: 1) sequential video decoding, the process of converting the raw bit stream to RGB frames can take up to a minute for hour-long video inputs, and 2) costly prefilling of up to several million tokens for LLM inference, resulting in high latency and memory use. To address these challenges, we propose QuickVideo, a system-algorithm co-design that substantially accelerates long-video understanding to support real-time downstream applications. It comprises three key innovations: QuickDecoder, a parallelized CPU-based video decoder that achieves 2-3 times speedup by splitting videos into keyframe-aligned intervals processed concurrently; QuickPrefill, a memory-efficient prefilling method using KV-cache pruning to support more frames with less GPU memory; and an overlapping scheme that overlaps CPU video decoding with GPU inference. Together, these components infernece time reduce by a minute on long video inputs, enabling scalable, high-quality video understanding even on limited hardware. Experiments show that QuickVideo generalizes across durations and sampling rates, making long video processing feasible in practice.

Maximal Update Parametrization (μP) is extended to diffusion Transformers, demonstrating efficient hyperparameter transferability and reduced tuning costs across various models and tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter (HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization (muP) was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However, it remains unclear whether muP of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we generalize standard muP to diffusion Transformers and validate its effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that muP of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT, PixArt-alpha, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer, enabling the direct application of existing muP methodologies. Leveraging this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-muP enjoys robust HP transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-muP with transferred learning rate achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of muP on text-to-image generation by scaling PixArt-alpha from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases, models under muP outperform their respective baselines while requiring small tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-alpha and 3% of consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish muP as a principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.

"Maximal Update Parametrization (μP) is extended to diffusion Transformers, demonstrating efficient hyperparameter transferability and reduced tuning costs across various models and tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter (HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization (muP) was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However, it remains unclear whether muP of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we generalize standard muP to diffusion Transformers and validate its effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that muP of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT, PixArt-alpha, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer, enabling the direct application of existing muP methodologies. Leveraging this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-muP enjoys robust HP transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-muP with transferred learning rate achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of muP on text-to-image generation by scaling PixArt-alpha from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases, models under muP outperform their respective baselines while requiring small tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-alpha and 3% of consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish muP as a principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers."

Reinforcement learning improves large language models with minimal parameter updates, affecting only a small subnetwork without explicit sparsity techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) yields substantial improvements in large language models (LLMs) downstream task performance and alignment with human values. Surprisingly, such large gains result from updating only a small subnetwork comprising just 5 percent to 30 percent of the parameters, with the rest effectively unchanged. We refer to this phenomenon as parameter update sparsity induced by RL. It is observed across all 7 widely used RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO, DPO) and all 10 LLMs from different families in our experiments. This sparsity is intrinsic and occurs without any explicit sparsity promoting regularizations or architectural constraints. Finetuning the subnetwork alone recovers the test accuracy, and, remarkably, produces a model nearly identical to the one obtained via full finetuning. The subnetworks from different random seeds, training data, and even RL algorithms show substantially greater overlap than expected by chance. Our analysis suggests that this sparsity is not due to updating only a subset of layers, instead, nearly all parameter matrices receive similarly sparse updates. Moreover, the updates to almost all parameter matrices are nearly full-rank, suggesting RL updates a small subset of parameters that nevertheless span almost the full subspaces that the parameter matrices can represent. We conjecture that the this update sparsity can be primarily attributed to training on data that is near the policy distribution, techniques that encourage the policy to remain close to the pretrained model, such as the KL regularization and gradient clipping, have limited impact.

Large vision-language models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to hallucination, often generating content misaligned with visual inputs. While recent approaches advance multi-modal Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate hallucination, they typically rely on predefined or randomly edited negative samples that fail to reflect actual model errors, limiting training efficacy. In this work, we propose an Online Vision-language Preference Learning (OViP) framework that dynamically constructs contrastive training data based on the model's own hallucinated outputs. By identifying semantic differences between sampled response pairs and synthesizing negative images using a diffusion model, OViP generates more relevant supervision signals in real time. This failure-driven training enables adaptive alignment of both textual and visual preferences. Moreover, we refine existing evaluation protocols to better capture the trade-off between hallucination suppression and expressiveness. Experiments on hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate that OViP effectively reduces hallucinations while preserving core multi-modal capabilities.
