INTRODUCTION HANGE detection (CD) in remote sensing (RS) images is vital technology for tracking geospatial changes [1], [2], with broad applications in urban planning [3], land monitoring [4], and disaster evaluation [5]. Still, the advent of vast sub-meter resolution datasets from sensors like WorldView, QuickBird, and Gaofen-2 has posed significant challenges to conventional methods like CVA [6] and Random Forest [7], revealing their diminished efficacy [8]. This has paved the way for deep learning-based CD to become the dominant This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant (2023YFB3907600). Z. Xie, S. Miao, Y. Jiang, Z. Zhang, and X. Li are with the College of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China (zx xie@cau.edu.cn; miaosx@cau.edu.cn; jiangyuhan@cau.edu.cn; zhewei@cau.edu.cn; xuecaoli@cau.edu.cn).

Unfortunately, even these advanced deep learning models are not without their own set of critical obstacles. Technically, the objective of CD tasks is to identify semantic changes of interest at pixel-wise level from two co-registered RS images acquired at different times. These differences in acquisition time inevitably lead to discrepancies in imaging conditions. Factors such as illumination intensity and seasonal turnover can introduce significant pseudo-changesnonsemantic variations like building shadows or phenological lawns before and after snow changes in vegetation (e.g., cover). Moreover, another challenge lies in the morphological ambiguity between objects of varying scales. For instance, the low-level textural patterns of newly paved footpath might be nearly identical to those of distant, large-scale construction site boundary, despite their clear conceptual disparity. This semantic gap between deep, high-level concepts and shallow, fine-grained details inevitably degrades the precision of boundary delineation. Therefore, to accurately identify changes of interest within complex scenarios, trustworthy CD model is expected to embody the following two capabilities: Pseudo-change suppression. Distinguishing genuine changes of interest from multitude of task-irrelevant interference. Semantics-aware alignment and fusion. Ensuring coherent fusion of multi-level features, aligning abstract semantics with fine-grained spatial details to produce well-delineated boundaries. Aiming at the aforementioned challenges, growing body of research has emerged, exploring solutions from variety of perspectives. For example, Tang et al. [10], and Li [11] have employed techniques like larger convolution kernels and dilated convolutions to incrementally expand the receptive fields of CNN models, thereby emphasizing the significance of environmental alterations [12]. Concurrently, the integration of attention mechanisms, such as self-attention (SelfAtt) [13] and cross-attention (CrossAtt) [14], has also become prevalent strategy for amplifying the most relevant information [15]. Moreover, it is now widely recognized that facilitating feature interaction between bi-temporal representations, before the final difference computation, is paramount for robust change discrimination [16][18]. For this purpose, Liu et al. [16]introduced partial feature exchange mechanism in the channel and spatial dimensions to promote information sharing between images. Fang et al. [18] constructed different temporal novel CD architecture named MetaChanger, which embeds cascade of alternating interaction modules within the backbone feature extractor. Perceiving that purely spatial domain interaction faces bottleneck in sufficiently disentangling authentic changes from background noise, the latest focus has gradually started shifting toward"
