Such environments give agents proper training space where they can learn from errors without impacting real users. RecoWorld distinguishes itself with dual-view architecture: simulated user and an agentic recommender engage in multi-turn interactions aimed at maximizing user retention. The user simulator reviews recommended items, updates its mindset, and when sensing potential user disengagement, generates reflective instructions. The agentic recommender adapts its recommendations by incorporating these user instructions and reasoning traces, creating dynamic feedback loop that actively engages users. This process leverages the exceptional reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs. We explore diverse content representations within the simulator, including text-based, multimodal, and semantic ID modeling, and discuss how multi-turn RL enables the recommender to refine its strategies through iterative interactions. RecoWorld also supports multi-agent simulations, allowing creators to simulate the responses of targeted user populations. It marks an important first step toward recommender systems where users and agents collaboratively shape personalized information streams. We envision new interaction paradigms where user instructs, recommender responds, jointly optimizing user retention and engagement.

Index TermsDeveloper-LLMs Conversations, Code Generation, CodeChat Dataset, Code Quality I. INTRODUCTION Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT [46] and Claude [4], trained on large corpora of text and code [73], aim to understand developer intent and provide functionally relevant responses. Developers increasingly engage with LLMs through conversational prompts to perform tasks such as code generation [33], [27] and code quality evaluation [66], [28]. These interactions typically unfold as conversations, composed of sequence of promptresponse pairs (i.e., turns) between developer and the LLM. Conversations may be single-turn, Suzhen Zhong and Ying Zou are with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queens University, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada. E-mail: {suzhen.zhong, ying.zou}@queensu.ca. Bram Adams is with the Maintenance, Construction and Intelligence of Software Lab (MCIS), School of Computing, Queens University, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada. E-mail: bram.adams@queensu.ca. (a) Single-turn Fig. 1: Examples of developerLLM conversations. (b) Multi-turn addressing isolated tasks, or multi-turn, involving iterative refinement based on prior context, as illustrated in Figure 1, which contrasts single-turn exchange with multi-turn, iterative dialogue. However, detailed conversational data from commercial LLM services such as OpenAI and Anthropic remains unavailable to the public due to privacy concerns [48] and intellectual property protections [5]. This limitation restricts comprehensive analyses and empirical studies. To address the lack of publicly accessible, prior research [76] has adopted methods to mine explicitly shared ChatGPT conversations from GitHub and Hacker News. While these methods provide valuable insights into LLM-driven code generation and workflows, they primarily rely on version control and issue-tracking artifacts (e.g., commits, issues, or pull requests), which tend to highlight finalized solutions or structured development tasks. In contrast, daily programming interactions typically involve iterative, exploratory, and frequently undocumented exchanges with LLMs, such as trial-and-error cycles, informal queries, and intermediate debugging conversations. This analysis is performed on CodeChat, large-scale dataset of real-world developerLLM conversations that we obtained by filtering the WildChat dataset [80], which comprises interactions mined from publicly accessible chatbot services. CodeChat comprises 82,845 developerLLM conversations, totalling 311,161 turns and 368,506 code snippets across more than 20 programming languages. topical This paper focuses on understanding the conversational characteristics, trends, and the quality of LLMgenerated code of code-centric developer-LLM interactions. Specifically, we investigate the following research questions (RQs): RQ1. What are the characteristics of developer-LLM conversations in CodeChat? Understanding the characteristics of developerLLM conversations provides foundational insights into how JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 18, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 2020 2 developers engage with and receive responses from LLMs. In CodeChat, LLM responses are significantly longer than developer prompts, with median token length ratio of 14:1. Compared to developer-generated answers on Stack Overflow, LLM responses are also more verbose, averaging approximately 2,000 characters per response, while Stack Overflow answers average 836 characters [43]. In terms of conversational dynamics, 68% of conversations are multi-turn, often because developers introduce new use cases, clarify missing details, or request additional features as the interaction progresses. LLMs generate code in over 20 languages, with 16% of LLM responses containing multi-language code, with common pairs like CSSHTML and JavaScript-HTML reflecting real-world usage. RQ2. What topics do developers most commonly prompt when interacting with LLMs? Analyzing the common topics from developer-LLM interactions reveal the needs and challenges developers face, and guide the development of LLMs to better support real-world coding tasks. We apply BERTopic [24], tra"

Text:"Agentic Software Engineering: Foundational Pillars and Research Roadmap AHMED E. HASSAN, Queens University, Canada HAO LI, Queens University, Canada DAYI LIN, Huawei Canada, Canada BRAM ADAMS, Queens University, Canada TSE-HSUN CHEN, Concordia University, Canada YUTARO KASHIWA, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan DONG QIU, Huawei Canada, Canada Agentic Software Engineering (SE 3.0) represents new era where intelligent agents are tasked not with simple code generation, but with achieving complex, goal-oriented SE objectives. To harness these new capabilities while ensuring trustworthiness, we must recognize fundamental duality within the SE field in the Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE for Agents. This duality demands radical reimagining of the foundational pillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest differently across each modality. This new vision of SE requires two distinct, purpose-built workbenches (aka tools) for these two collaborative modalities: the Agent Command Environment (ACE), command center where humans orchestrate, mentor, and oversee agent teams while managing an inbox of agent-generated events like Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs); and the Agent Execution Environment (AEE), digital workbench where agents not only execute tasks but can proactively invoke human expertise when facing complex trade-offs or ambiguity. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated human callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering activities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating the practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering. This paper presents the Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision, outlining several of the foundational pillars for the future of SE. The paper culminates in research roadmap that identifies few key challenges and opportunities while br"

RecoWorld is a simulated environment for agentic recommender systems that uses a dual-view architecture with user and recommender interactions, leveraging LLMs and multi-turn RL to enhance user retention and engagement.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present RecoWorld, a blueprint for building simulated environments tailored to agentic recommender systems. Such environments give agents a proper training space where they can learn from errors without impacting real users. RecoWorld distinguishes itself with a dual-view architecture: a simulated user and an agentic recommender engage in multi-turn interactions aimed at maximizing user retention. The user simulator reviews recommended items, updates its mindset, and when sensing potential user disengagement, generates reflective instructions. The agentic recommender adapts its recommendations by incorporating these user instructions and reasoning traces, creating a dynamic feedback loop that actively engages users. This process leverages the exceptional reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs. We explore diverse content representations within the simulator, including text-based, multimodal, and semantic ID modeling, and discuss how multi-turn RL enables the recommender to refine its strategies through iterative interactions. RecoWorld also supports multi-agent simulations, allowing creators to simulate the responses of targeted user populations. It marks an important first step toward recommender systems where users and agents collaboratively shape personalized information streams. We envision new interaction paradigms where "user instructs, recommender responds," jointly optimizing user retention and engagement.

Analysis of real-world developer-LLM conversations reveals patterns in task outcomes, code quality, and common issues across multiple programming languages.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming integral to modern software development workflows, assisting developers with code generation, API explanation, and iterative problem-solving through natural language conversations. Despite widespread adoption, there is limited understanding of how developers interact with LLMs in practice and how these conversational dynamics influence task outcomes, code quality, and software engineering workflows. To address this, we leverage CodeChat, a large dataset comprising 82,845 real-world developer-LLM conversations, containing 368,506 code snippets generated across over 20 programming languages, derived from the WildChat dataset. We find that LLM responses are substantially longer than developer prompts, with a median token-length ratio of 14:1. Multi-turn conversations account for 68% of the dataset and often evolve due to shifting requirements, incomplete prompts, or clarification requests. Topic analysis identifies web design (9.6% of conversations) and neural network training (8.7% of conversations) as the most frequent LLM-assisted tasks. Evaluation across five languages (i.e., Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, and C#) reveals prevalent and language-specific issues in LLM-generated code: generated Python and JavaScript code often include undefined variables (83.4% and 75.3% of code snippets, respectively); Java code lacks required comments (75.9%); C++ code frequently omits headers (41.1%) and C# code shows unresolved namespaces (49.2%). During a conversation, syntax and import errors persist across turns; however, documentation quality in Java improves by up to 14.7%, and import handling in Python improves by 3.7% over 5 turns. Prompts that point out mistakes in code generated in prior turns and explicitly request a fix are most effective for resolving errors.

Prompts that point out mistakes in code generated in prior turns and explicitly request a fix are most effective for resolving errors."

Agentic Software Engineering introduces a dual modality approach with human and agent collaboration, redefining software engineering processes and tools to achieve complex, goal-oriented objectives.  					AI-generated summary 				 Agentic Software Engineering (SE 3.0) represents a new era where intelligent agents are tasked not with simple code generation, but with achieving complex, goal-oriented SE objectives. To harness these new capabilities while ensuring trustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in the Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE for Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational pillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest differently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to support this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command center where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such as Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The Agent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform tasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex trade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated human callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering activities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating the practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering. This paper presents the Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision, outlining several of the foundational pillars for the future of SE. The paper culminates in a research roadmap that identifies a few key challenges and opportunities while briefly discussing the resulting impact of this future on SE education. Our goal is not to offer a definitive solution, but to provide a conceptual scaffold with structured vocabulary to catalyze a community-wide dialogue, pushing the SE community to think beyond its classic, human-centric tenets toward a disciplined, scalable, and trustworthy agentic future.
