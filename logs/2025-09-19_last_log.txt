INTRODUCTION HANGE detection (CD) in remote sensing (RS) images is vital technology for tracking geospatial changes [1], [2], with broad applications in urban planning [3], land monitoring [4], and disaster evaluation [5]. Still, the advent of vast sub-meter resolution datasets from sensors like WorldView, QuickBird, and Gaofen-2 has posed significant challenges to conventional methods like CVA [6] and Random Forest [7], revealing their diminished efficacy [8]. This has paved the way for deep learning-based CD to become the dominant This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant (2023YFB3907600). Z. Xie, S. Miao, Y. Jiang, Z. Zhang, and X. Li are with the College of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China (zx xie@cau.edu.cn; miaosx@cau.edu.cn; jiangyuhan@cau.edu.cn; zhewei@cau.edu.cn; xuecaoli@cau.edu.cn).

Unfortunately, even these advanced deep learning models are not without their own set of critical obstacles. Technically, the objective of CD tasks is to identify semantic changes of interest at pixel-wise level from two co-registered RS images acquired at different times. These differences in acquisition time inevitably lead to discrepancies in imaging conditions. Factors such as illumination intensity and seasonal turnover can introduce significant pseudo-changesnonsemantic variations like building shadows or phenological lawns before and after snow changes in vegetation (e.g., cover). Moreover, another challenge lies in the morphological ambiguity between objects of varying scales. For instance, the low-level textural patterns of newly paved footpath might be nearly identical to those of distant, large-scale construction site boundary, despite their clear conceptual disparity. This semantic gap between deep, high-level concepts and shallow, fine-grained details inevitably degrades the precision of boundary delineation. Therefore, to accurately identify changes of interest within complex scenarios, trustworthy CD model is expected to embody the following two capabilities: Pseudo-change suppression. Distinguishing genuine changes of interest from multitude of task-irrelevant interference. Semantics-aware alignment and fusion. Ensuring coherent fusion of multi-level features, aligning abstract semantics with fine-grained spatial details to produce well-delineated boundaries. Aiming at the aforementioned challenges, growing body of research has emerged, exploring solutions from variety of perspectives. For example, Tang et al. [10], and Li [11] have employed techniques like larger convolution kernels and dilated convolutions to incrementally expand the receptive fields of CNN models, thereby emphasizing the significance of environmental alterations [12]. Concurrently, the integration of attention mechanisms, such as self-attention (SelfAtt) [13] and cross-attention (CrossAtt) [14], has also become prevalent strategy for amplifying the most relevant information [15]. Moreover, it is now widely recognized that facilitating feature interaction between bi-temporal representations, before the final difference computation, is paramount for robust change discrimination [16][18]. For this purpose, Liu et al. [16]introduced partial feature exchange mechanism in the channel and spatial dimensions to promote information sharing between images. Fang et al. [18] constructed different temporal novel CD architecture named MetaChanger, which embeds cascade of alternating interaction modules within the backbone feature extractor. Perceiving that purely spatial domain interaction faces bottleneck in sufficiently disentangling authentic changes from background noise, the latest focus has gradually started shifting toward"

Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models (ST-AR) enhances image understanding and generation quality in autoregressive models by addressing key visual semantics challenges through self-supervised objectives.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of high-quality visual representations in image generation and have highlighted the limitations of generative models in image understanding. As a generative paradigm originally designed for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms of applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency, and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models (ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.

We identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency, and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models (ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models and leads to improved generation quality.

A zero-shot framework using multimodal large language models for spatio-temporal video grounding employs decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting and temporal-augmented assembling strategies to improve grounding accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as grounding tokens, for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query (e.g., attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods on three common STVG benchmarks.   The code will be available at https://github.com/zaiquanyang/LLaVA_Next_STVG.

FSG-Net addresses false alarms and semantic gaps in change detection by using a frequency-spatial synergistic approach with wavelet interaction, attention mechanisms, and gated fusion.  					AI-generated summary 				 Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g., illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries. To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations. Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components. Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers. Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.
