Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (e.g., PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into normalized target distribution using learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves significant average improvement of 10.0% over GRPO and 5.1% over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning. 5 2 0 S 8 1 ] .

We propose novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame and language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories, thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction. Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the proposed pretraining strategy provides more effective initialization for VLA models.

Text:"5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 6 7 4 4 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r aATOKEN: UNIFIED TOKENIZER FOR VISION Jiasen Lu Liangchen Song Mingze Xu Byeongjoo AhnWe present ATOKEN, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both highfidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos, and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, ATOKEN encodes these diverse visual inputs into shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and modalities in single framework. Specifically, we introduce pure transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By employing progressive training curriculum, ATOKEN gradually expands from single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent tokens. ATOKEN achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, ATOKEN enables both visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual tokenization.Large Language Models (LLMs) (Chowdhery et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2025) have achieved unprecedented generalization, with single models handling coding, reasoning, translation, and numerous other tasks that previously required specialized systems. This versatility largely stems from transformer architectures and simple tokenizers, such as BPE (Sennrich et al., 2015), which convert all text types code, documents, tables, and multiple languages into unified token space. This shared representation enables efficient scaling and seamless knowledge transfer across language tasks. In contrast, visual representations remain fragmented due to inherent complexities. Unlike texts discrete symbolic nature, visual tasks demand distinct levels of abstraction: generation requires tokenizers that preserve low-level visual details for reconstruction, while understanding requires encoders that extract high-level semantic features through text alignment. Moreover, visual data exists in disparate formats: 2D grids for images, temporal sequences for videos, and varied 3D representations (e.g., meshes, voxels, and Gaussian splats) (Mescheder et al., 2019; Achlioptas et al., 2018; Mildenhall et al., 2021; Kerbl et al., 2023). Without shared representation, vision systems remain fundamentally limited, unable to achieve the generalization and transfer learning that characterizes modern language models. Despite recent progress, unified visual tokenizers face three fundamental challenges. First, existing approaches optimize for either reconstruction or understanding, but not both: visual encoders (Radford et al., 2021; Zhai et al., 2023; Bolya et al., 2025) achieve semantic alignment but lack *Leading authors, equal contribution. Description of each authors contribution is available in Appendix A. Corresponding to Jiasen Lu.Figure 1: Illustration of our method on different visual modalities. Given images, videos, and 3D assets, ATOKEN leverages shared 4D latent space (left) to produce high-fidelity reconstructions (middle: zoomed regions with red boxes for images, temporal frames for videos, multiple viewpoints for 3D) while preserving strong semantic understanding (right: showing text-aligned representations for zero-shot text retrieval). pixel-level detail, while VAE-based tokenizers (Esser et al., 2020; Rombach et al., 2022; Polyak et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2022b) preserve visual details but lack semantic understanding. Second, architectural choices create different limitations: convolutional tokenizers exhibit diminishing returns when scaling model parameters (Xiong et al., 2025), while transformer tokenizers (Yu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2024b; Hansen-Estruch et al., 2025) achieve better scaling but suffer from severe adversarial training instabilities. Third, recent unification efforts remain limited to images (Deng et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2024c; Ma et al., 2025a), while video and 3D modalities remain unexplored. In this paper, we present ATOKEN, general-purpose visual tokenizer that achieves high-fidelity reconstruction and rich semantic understanding across images, videos, and 3D. Our model learns unified representation that captures both fine-grained visual details and high-level semantics, accessible through progressive encoding: semantic embeddings for understanding, low-dimensional continuous latents for generation, and discrete tokens via quantization. This design enables the next generation of multimodal systems that seamlessly handle both understanding and generation across all visual modalities, as shown in Figure 1. To address format discrepancies across visual modalities, we introduce sparse 4D representation where each modality naturally occupies different subspaces: images as 2D slices, videos as temporal stacks, and 3D assets as surface voxels extracted from multi-view renderings (Xiang et al., 2024). We implement this through pure transformer architecture with space-time patch embeddings and 4D Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), enabling efficient scaling and joint modeling across all modalities while maintaining native resolution and temporal length processing. To overcome training instabilities that affect transformer-based visual tokenizers, we develop an adversarial-free loss combining perceptual and Gram matrix terms. This approach achieves stateof-the-art reconstruction quality while maintaining stable, scalable training. We further introduce progressive curriculum that builds capabilities incrementally: starting from pretrained vision encoder, jointly optimizing reconstruction and understanding for images, extending to videos and 3D data, with optional quantization for discrete tokens. Surprisingly, this curriculum reveals that multimodal training can enhance rather than compromise single-modality performance our final model achieves"

FlowRL enhances LLM reinforcement learning by matching the full reward distribution through flow balancing, improving diversity and performance over reward-maximizing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of 10.0% over GRPO and 5.1% over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.

EVOL-RL, a label-free reinforcement learning method, enhances large language models by balancing stability and variation, preventing entropy collapse and improving generalization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing label-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote objectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an entropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike prior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which primarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is broader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's inherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We formalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free Reinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with variation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer as a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors responses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced (variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also uses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer to sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design prevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and improves both pass@1 and pass@n. EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the majority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5% to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents diversity collapse but also unlocks stronger generalization across domains (e.g., GPQA). Furthermore, we demonstrate that EVOL-RL also boosts performance in the RLVR setting, highlighting its broad applicability.

FinSearchComp is an open-source benchmark for evaluating financial search and reasoning capabilities of end-to-end agents, featuring realistic tasks and professional annotations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely viewed as critical on the path toward more general intelligence. Finance is a particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex, multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate. We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70 professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products) on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy. DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact performance significantly.By aligning with realistic analyst tasks and providing end-to-end evaluation, FinSearchComp offers a professional, high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning.

MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset with over 107K high-quality image editing samples, improves performance on sophisticated editing tasks using a novel pipeline with multi-modal large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current instruction-based image editing (IBIE) methods struggle with challenging editing tasks, as both editing types and sample counts of existing datasets are limited. Moreover, traditional dataset construction often contains noisy image-caption pairs, which may introduce biases and limit model capabilities in complex editing scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset featuring over 107K high-quality image editing samples. It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively preserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark. We believe MultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse and challenging IBIE capabilities.

RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action model, uses a two-stage pretraining approach and ActionVAE to achieve superior performance on robotics tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories, thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction. Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA models.

"RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action model, uses a two-stage pretraining approach and ActionVAE to achieve superior performance on robotics tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories, thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction. Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA models."

WorldForge, a training-free framework, enhances video diffusion models with precise motion control and photorealistic content generation through recursive refinement, flow-gated latent fusion, and dual-path self-corrective guidance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent video diffusion models demonstrate strong potential in spatial intelligence tasks due to their rich latent world priors. However, this potential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric inconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical use in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or fine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high computational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free, inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step Recursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during inference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising step to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels. Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and photorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory consistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play paradigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on leveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence.

AToken, a unified visual tokenizer, achieves high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos, and 3D assets using a 4D transformer architecture with adversarial-free training.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos, and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual tokenization.
