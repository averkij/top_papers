Text:"EQ-VAE: Equivariance Regularized Latent Space for Improved Generative Image Modeling Theodoros Kouzelis 1 2 Ioannis Kakogeorgiou 1 Spyros Gidaris 3 Nikos Komodakis 1 4 5 5 2 0 2 4 1 ] . [ 2 9 0 5 9 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aLatent generative models have emerged as leading approach for high-quality image synthesis. These models rely on an autoencoder to compress images into latent space, followed by generative model to learn the latent distribution. We identify that existing autoencoders lack equivariance to semantic-preserving transformations like scaling and rotation, resulting in complex latent spaces that hinder generative performance. To address this, we propose EQ-VAE, simple regularization approach that enforces equivariance in the latent space, reducing its complexity without degrading reconstruction quality. By finetuning pre-trained autoencoders with EQ-VAE, we enhance the performance of several state-ofthe-art generative models, including DiT, SiT, REPA and MaskGIT, achieving 7 speedup on DiT-XL/2 with only five epochs of SD-VAE fine-tuning. EQ-VAE is compatible with both continuous and discrete autoencoders, thus offering versatile enhancement for wide range of latent generative models. Project page and code: https://eq-vae.github.io/. 1. Introduction Latent generative models (Rombach et al., 2022) have become dominant framework for high-fidelity image synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art results across diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024), masked generative modeling (Chang et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023), and autoregressive models (Esser et al., 2021; Li et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2024). These models operate in two phases. First, an autoencoder compresses high-dimensional images into lower-dimensional latent space, which can be continuous (e.g., SD-VAE for diffusion (Rombach et al., 1Archimedes, Athena RC, Greece 2National Technical University of Athens, Greece 3valaio.ai, France 4University of Crete, Greece 5IACM-Forth, Greece. Correspondence to: Theodoros Kouzelis <theodoros.kouzelis@athenarc.gr>. 1 2022)) or discrete (e.g., VQ-GAN for autoregressive (Esser et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022b) and masked generative modeling (Chang et al., 2022)). This latent space retains essential semantic and structural information while discarding highfrequency details. Second, generative model learns to model the distribution of these latent representations, enabling the synthesis of visually coherent images. At inference time, the generative model first samples latent code, which is then decoded back into the image space by the autoencoder. While much research has focused on improving the generative phasethrough advances in architectures (Peebles & Xie, 2023), objectives (Ma et al., 2024), and optimization techniques (Yao et al., 2024)the autoencoders role in shaping the latent space remains equally critical to overall performance. In fact, the quality of the latent space is pivotal, influencing both computational efficiency (by reducing dimensionality and accelerating convergence in the generative phase) and the models ability to produce high-fidelity outputs (Rombach et al., 2022). In diffusion models, most state-of-theart approachessuch as DiT (Peebles & Xie, 2023), SiT (Ma et al., 2024), PixArt (Chen et al., 2024), SD3 (Esser et al., 2024), and Flux (Black Forest Labs, 2023)rely on autoencoders with architectures and training objectives similar to the SD-VAE introduced in Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) (Rombach et al., 2022). LDM explores two widely adopted regularization strategies: continuous variational approach and discrete codebook framework. The variational approach uses KL divergence term to align the latent distribution with Gaussian prior, promoting smooth and structured latent space (Kingma & Welling, 2014). Alternatively, the discrete codebook framework constrains the latent space to finite set of learned embeddings, limiting its complexity and providing different form of regularization (Esser et al., 2021). These regularization strategies inherently introduce tradeoff. Stronger regularization, such as increasing the weight of the KL divergence term, produces smoother and more learnable latent space for the generative model in the second phase (Tschannen et al., 2025). However, it also reduces the information capacity of the latent representation, leading to loss of fine-grained details and ultimately degrading EQ-VAE: Equivariance Regularized Latent Space for Improved Generative Image Modeling Image SD-VAE +Ours SDXL-VAE +Ours 0 5 - G 40 20 5 DiT-XL/2 DiT-XL/2 + Ours REPA REPA + Ours 7 speed-up 4 speed-up 100K 400K 1M 2.3M 4M 7M Training Iteration Figure 1: Latent Space Structure (Left) Top three principal components of SD-VAE and SDXL-VAE, with and without EQ-VAE, demonstrating visually that our regularization produces smoother latent representations without compromising reconstruction (See Table 1). Accelerated Training (Right) Training curves (without classifier-free guidance) for DiT-XL/2 and REPA (w/ SiT-XL/2), showing that our EQ-VAE accelerates convergence by 7 and 4, respectively. reconstruction quality. Empirical evidence suggests that this trade-off can set an upper bound on the overall performance of latent generative models (Rombach et al., 2022), as the autoencoders limited capacity to preserve detailed information restricts the overall ability of latent generative models to synthesize highly-fidelity images. This raises fundamental question: Can we mitigate this trade-off, creating latent space that is more optimized for generative modeling, without compromising reconstruction quality, thereby improving the overall generative modeling process? key aspect that could address this challenge lies in the structure and properties of the latent space itself. In particular, we identify an essential limitation of current state-of-theart autoencoders: their latent representations are not equivariant to basic spatial transformations, such as scaling and rotation (see Figure 2; extended discussion in Sec. 3.2). This introduces unnecessary complexity into the latent manifold, forcing the generative model to learn nonlinear relationships that could otherwise be avoided. To address this issue, we propose simple yet effective modification to the training objective of autoencoders that encourages latent spaces to exhibit the aforementioned equivariance. Our method called EQ-VAE, penalizes discrepancies between reconstructions of transformed"

Latent generative models have emerged as a leading approach for high-quality image synthesis. These models rely on an autoencoder to compress images into a latent space, followed by a generative model to learn the latent distribution. We identify that existing autoencoders lack equivariance to semantic-preserving transformations like scaling and rotation, resulting in complex latent spaces that hinder generative performance. To address this, we propose EQ-VAE, a simple regularization approach that enforces equivariance in the latent space, reducing its complexity without degrading reconstruction quality. By finetuning pre-trained autoencoders with EQ-VAE, we enhance the performance of several state-of-the-art generative models, including DiT, SiT, REPA and MaskGIT, achieving a 7 speedup on DiT-XL/2 with only five epochs of SD-VAE fine-tuning. EQ-VAE is compatible with both continuous and discrete autoencoders, thus offering a versatile enhancement for a wide range of latent generative models.
