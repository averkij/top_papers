Text:"HermesFlow: Seamlessly Closing the Gap in Multimodal Understanding and Generation Ling Yang * 1 Xinchen Zhang * 2 Ye Tian 1 Chenming Shang 2 Minghao Xu 1 3 Wentao Zhang 1 Bin Cui 1 https://github.com/Gen-Verse/HermesFlow 5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 8 4 1 2 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract The remarkable success of the autoregressive paradigm has made significant advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with powerful models like Show-o, Transfusion and Emu3 achieving notable progress in unified image understanding and generation. For the first time, we uncover common phenomenon: the understanding capabilities of MLLMs are typically stronger than their generative capabilities, with significant gap between the two. Building on this insight, we propose HermesFlow, simple yet general framework designed to seamlessly bridge the gap between understanding and generation in MLLMs. Specifically, we take the homologous data as input to curate homologous preference data of both understanding and generation. Through Pair-DPO and self-play iterative optimization, HermesFlow effectively aligns multimodal understanding and generation using homologous preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over prior methods, particularly in narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation. These findings highlight the potential of HermesFlow as general alignment framework for next-generation multimodal foundation models. 1.

[ 1 5 7 7 1 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r aWhile recent advancements in reasoning optimization have significantly enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), existing efforts to improve reasoning have been limited to solving mathematical problems and focusing on visual graphical inputs, neglecting broader applications in general video understanding. This paper proposes video-SALMONN-o1, the first open-source reasoning-enhanced audiovisual LLM designed for general video understanding tasks. To enhance its reasoning abilities, we develop reasoning-intensive dataset featuring challenging audio-visual questions with step-bystep solutions. We also propose process direct preference optimization (pDPO), which leverages contrastive step selection to achieve efficient steplevel reward modelling tailored for multimodal inputs. Additionally, we introduce RivaBench, the first reasoning-intensive video understanding benchmark, featuring over 4,000 high-quality, expert-curated question-answer pairs across scenarios such as standup comedy, academic presentations, and synthetic video detection. videoSALMONN-o1 achieves 3-8% accuracy improvements over the LLaVA-OneVision baseline across different video reasoning benchmarks. Besides, pDPO achieves 6-8% improvements compared to the supervised fine-tuning model on RivaBench. Enhanced reasoning enables video-SALMONNo1 zero-shot synthetic video detection capabilities. Demo Page: https://github.com/ BriansIDP/video-SALMONN-o1 1. Introduction The recent advancements in optimizing the reasoning process have further boosted text-based large language models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek Team, 2024; Qwen 1Univeristy of Cambridge 2ByteDance 3Tsinghua university. Correspondence to: Chao Zhang <cz277@tsinghua.edu.cn>. Preprint. 1 Team, 2024b; Zhao et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024) performance in answering complex logical questions, such as math problems (Yang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b; Sun et al., 2024d; Ying et al., 2024) and coding tasks (Zhang et al., 2024e). These methods usually first split the solution into multiple simpler steps to form reasoning path ending with the final solution, as demonstrated in chain-of-thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022). Advanced training approaches have been developed such as the outcome reward model (ORM) (Cobbe et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024b) that optimizes the entire reasoning path based on the final solution, and the process reward model (PRM) (Uesato et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a) that optimizes each reasoning step based on how likely each step would lead to correct answer. In addition to text-based questions, reasoning also plays an indispensable role in understanding the physical world, such as comprehending concepts in an academic presentation, interpreting complex interactions among people or even detecting artificial anomalies. Thus, improving reasoning ability is also critical for multimodal LLMs (Tang et al., 2024c;b; Sun et al., 2024b; Cheng et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024d; Lin et al., 2024; Team et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Tang et al., 2024a) that process audio and visual inputs in addition to text, as the interactions among multiple modalities can largely increase the difficulty of the task. To this end, investigations have been performed on optimizing the reasoning process with multimodal inputs (Du et al., 2024), and on particularly visual LLMs (Qwen Team, 2024a; Xu et al., 2024; Du et al., 2025). However, current research on enhancing reasoning capabilities for multimodal LLMs has predominantly focused on solving mathematical problems and image inputs. This overlooks the importance of reasoning in general video understanding and the interactions among audio, visual and text modalities, largely limiting their scopes of applications. This paper proposes video-SALMONN-o1, the first opensource reasoning-enhanced audio-visual LLM with improved reasoning abilities in general video understanding tasks. The audio-visual reasoning capability of videoSALMONN-o1 is first enhanced by creating new dataset with challenging questions and step-by-step solutions for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and then further boosted by the video-SALMONN-o1: Reasoning-enhanced Audio-visual Large Language Model proposed variant of direct preference optimization (DPO), process DPO (pDPO) (Rafailov et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024c). pDPO achieves step-level pairwise reward modelling via an efficient contrastive step selection approach tailored for multimodal inputs. While being more effective than the standard PRMs in general video understanding, pDPO and the step selection make audio-visual reasoning more efficient without the need for an external reward model or two-pass re-ranking pipeline. To evaluate the performance on multimodal reasoning for general video understanding, we propose the first reasoningintensive video with audio understanding benchmark (RivaBench). RivaBench primarily focuses on three representative scenarios, including standup comedy, academic presentation and synthetic video detection. In particular, RivaBench contains over 4k high-quality question-answer pairs that are carefully crafted by human experts (e.g. medical doctors). Our key contributions are summarized as follows: We propose video-SALMONN-o1, the first open-source reasoning-enhanced audio-visual LLM for general video understanding tasks. video-SALMONN-o1 is the first to explore RL-based reasoning optimization for general video understanding. The proposed pDPO method with efficient contrastive step selection further enhances reasoning abilities. We propose RivaBench, the first general video understanding benchmark focusing on challenging audio-visual reasoning scenarios with human expert annotations. video-SALMONN-o1 consistently outperforms the strong LLaVA-OneVision visual baseline on VideoMME, NExTQA and RivaBench, with 3-8% absolute accuracy improvements. The pDPO training achieved 6-8% improvements on RivaBench over the SFT model. Moreover, video-SALMONN-o1 is also the first open-source model that showed zero-shot synthetic video detection ability. 2. Related Work 2.1.

We argue that the ability of current LLMs to prove statements largely depends on whether they have encountered the relevant proof process during training. This reliance limits their deeper understanding of mathematical theorems and related concepts. Inspired by the pedagogical method of proof by counterexamples commonly used in human mathematics education, our work aims to enhance LLMs ability to conduct mathematical reasoning and proof through counterexamples. Specifically, we manually create high-quality, university-level mathematical benchmark, COUNTERMATH, which requires LLMs to prove mathematical statements by providing counterexamples, thereby assessing their grasp of mathematical concepts. Additionally, we develop data engineering framework to automatically obtain training data for further model improvement. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses demonstrate that COUNTERMATH is challenging, indicating that LLMs, such as OpenAI o1, have insufficient counterexample-driven proof capabilities. Moreover, our exploration into model training reveals that strengthening LLMs counterexample-driven conceptual reasoning abilities is crucial for improving their overall mathematical capabilities. We believe that our work offers new perspectives on the community of mathematical LLMs. *Equal contribution. 1Tsinghua University.

Correspondence to: Zhikun Xu <zhikunxu@asu.edu>. 1 Mathematics, as fundamental aspect of reasoning, has garnered significant research interest. Recent studies have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong mathematical reasoning abilities (OpenAI, 2023; Google, 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024; Ying et al., 2024; Chern et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024a). Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has become prominent and fundamental topic within the LLMs research community. Currently, there are two main paradigms for enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The first involves synthetic generation based on seed math questions (Yu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a). For example, WizardMath (Luo et al., 2023) introduces variety of math instructions to generate math questions of different complexities using GPT-3.5. The second approach leverages formal mathematical languages to train LLM-based theorem provers, such as Lean 4 (Moura & Ullrich, 2021). For instance, Draft-Sketch-Prove (Jiang et al., 2023), HunyuanProver (Li et al., 2024c), and Lean-STaR (Lin et al., 2024a) interact with formal languages through informal proofs, automatic formalization, and natural language thoughts for theorem proving. The two methods above enable LLMs to develop problemsolving skills either by training on massive similar problems, or by gaining proficiency through exposure to similar proof processes (Mirzadeh et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024b). In both cases, these approaches enhance LLMs mathematical reasoning abilities through training, where proficiency is achieved through familiarity, akin to drill-based learning in human mathematics learning. However, relying solely on intensive-practice by inundating LLMs with math problems is neither sufficient nor essential for true mathematics learning. In other words, drill-based learning alone does not foster deep understanding of mathematical concepts in either humans or LLMs. As illustrated in Figure 1, for human mathematics learning, example-based learning is more important strategy than drill-based learning. In particular, for mathematical proofs, COUNTERMATH: Counterexample-Driven Conceptual Reasoning in Mathematical LLMs Figure 1. Comparison between drill-based learning and example-based learning. The first two math LLMs fail when confronted with advanced mathematics, and Proving by examples is highly creative and concept-intensive mathematical skill. proof by counterexamples is an indispensable approach. Inspired by the idea that counterexample-driven proofs better reflect deep understanding of mathematical concepts, we propose COUNTERMATH, counterexample-based mathematical reasoning benchmark. COUNTERMATH is designed to evaluate LLMs ability to distinguish subtle differences between mathematical terms and properties at university-level by providing examples. Specifically, we collect 1,216 statement-rationale pairs from mathematical textbooks, focusing on disproving certain statements under unusual conditions using counterexamples. In terms of difficulty, COUNTERMATH covers advanced mathematical knowledge similar to PutnamBench (Tsoukalas et al.) and Putnam-AXIOM (Gulati et al., 2024), both of which assess the depth of mathematical understanding in LLMs. In addition to extensively evaluating various mainstream mathematics LLMs on COUNTERMATH, we also develop framework for automatically acquiring counterexamplebased mathematical reasoning data to enable further model training. Detailed analyses of both the evaluated LLMs and our trained LLMs reveal that: The contemporary LLMs including OpenAI o1 exhibit limited performance in determining whether statement in COUNTERMATH is true or false, indicating significant room for improvement in higher-level mathematical conceptual reasoning. When analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs, many models still struggle with example-based reasoning. This demonstrates the limitations of drill-based learning and underscores the potential value of COUNTERMATH in advancing mathematical LLMs. Lower performance is observed in topology and real analysis during our fine-grained evaluation, which indicates promising future research directions. Further studies on mathematical LLMs should explore these underrepresented areas of higher mathematics. Our fine-tuned model, trained with only 1,025 training samples, demonstrates strong performa"

We propose Diffusion-Sharpening, a fine-tuning approach that enhances downstream alignment by optimizing sampling trajectories. Existing RL-based fine-tuning methods focus on single training timesteps and neglect trajectory-level alignment, while recent sampling trajectory optimization methods incur significant inference NFE costs. Diffusion-Sharpening overcomes this by using a path integral framework to select optimal trajectories during training, leveraging reward feedback, and amortizing inference costs. Our method demonstrates superior training efficiency with faster convergence, and best inference efficiency without requiring additional NFEs. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion-Sharpening outperforms RL-based fine-tuning methods (e.g., Diffusion-DPO) and sampling trajectory optimization methods (e.g., Inference Scaling) across diverse metrics including text alignment, compositional capabilities, and human preferences, offering a scalable and efficient solution for future diffusion model fine-tuning.

The remarkable success of the autoregressive paradigm has made significant advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with powerful models like Show-o, Transfusion and Emu3 achieving notable progress in unified image understanding and generation. For the first time, we uncover a common phenomenon: the understanding capabilities of MLLMs are typically stronger than their generative capabilities, with a significant gap between the two. Building on this insight, we propose HermesFlow, a simple yet general framework designed to seamlessly bridge the gap between understanding and generation in MLLMs. Specifically, we take the homologous data as input to curate homologous preference data of both understanding and generation. Through Pair-DPO and self-play iterative optimization, HermesFlow effectively aligns multimodal understanding and generation using homologous preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over prior methods, particularly in narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation. These findings highlight the potential of HermesFlow as a general alignment framework for next-generation multimodal foundation models. Code: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/HermesFlow

While recent advancements in reasoning optimization have significantly enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), existing efforts to improve reasoning have been limited to solving mathematical problems and focusing on visual graphical inputs, neglecting broader applications in general video understanding.This paper proposes video-SALMONN-o1, the first open-source reasoning-enhanced audio-visual LLM designed for general video understanding tasks. To enhance its reasoning abilities, we develop a reasoning-intensive dataset featuring challenging audio-visual questions with step-by-step solutions. We also propose process direct preference optimization (pDPO), which leverages contrastive step selection to achieve efficient step-level reward modelling tailored for multimodal inputs. Additionally, we introduce RivaBench, the first reasoning-intensive video understanding benchmark, featuring over 4,000 high-quality, expert-curated question-answer pairs across scenarios such as standup comedy, academic presentations, and synthetic video detection. video-SALMONN-o1 achieves 3-8% accuracy improvements over the LLaVA-OneVision baseline across different video reasoning benchmarks. Besides, pDPO achieves 6-8% improvements compared to the supervised fine-tuning model on RivaBench. Enhanced reasoning enables video-SALMONN-o1 zero-shot synthetic video detection capabilities.

We also propose process direct preference optimization (pDPO), which leverages contrastive step selection to achieve efficient step-level reward modelling tailored for multimodal inputs. Additionally, we introduce RivaBench, the first reasoning-intensive video understanding benchmark, featuring over 4,000 high-quality, expert-curated question-answer pairs across scenarios such as standup comedy, academic presentations, and synthetic video detection. video-SALMONN-o1 achieves 3-8% accuracy improvements over the LLaVA-OneVision baseline across different video reasoning benchmarks. Besides, pDPO achieves 6-8% improvements compared to the supervised fine-tuning model on RivaBench. Enhanced reasoning enables video-SALMONN-o1 zero-shot synthetic video detection capabilities."

Recent advancements in LLM-based multi-agent (LLM-MA) systems have shown promise, yet significant challenges remain in managing communication and refinement when agents collaborate on complex tasks. In this paper, we propose Talk Structurally, Act Hierarchically (TalkHier), a novel framework that introduces a structured communication protocol for context-rich exchanges and a hierarchical refinement system to address issues such as incorrect outputs, falsehoods, and biases. TalkHier surpasses various types of SoTA, including inference scaling model (OpenAI-o1), open-source multi-agent models (e.g., AgentVerse), and majority voting strategies on current LLM and single-agent baselines (e.g., ReAct, GPT4o), across diverse tasks, including open-domain question answering, domain-specific selective questioning, and practical advertisement text generation. These results highlight its potential to set a new standard for LLM-MA systems, paving the way for more effective, adaptable, and collaborative multi-agent frameworks. The code is available https://github.com/sony/talkhier.

Leveraging mathematical Large Language Models (LLMs) for proof generation is a fundamental topic in LLMs research. We argue that the ability of current LLMs to prove statements largely depends on whether they have encountered the relevant proof process during training. This reliance limits their deeper understanding of mathematical theorems and related concepts. Inspired by the pedagogical method of "proof by counterexamples" commonly used in human mathematics education, our work aims to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct mathematical reasoning and proof through counterexamples. Specifically, we manually create a high-quality, university-level mathematical benchmark, CounterMATH, which requires LLMs to prove mathematical statements by providing counterexamples, thereby assessing their grasp of mathematical concepts. Additionally, we develop a data engineering framework to automatically obtain training data for further model improvement. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses demonstrate that CounterMATH is challenging, indicating that LLMs, such as OpenAI o1, have insufficient counterexample-driven proof capabilities. Moreover, our exploration into model training reveals that strengthening LLMs' counterexample-driven conceptual reasoning abilities is crucial for improving their overall mathematical capabilities. We believe that our work offers new perspectives on the community of mathematical LLMs.
