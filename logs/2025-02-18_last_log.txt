Text:"I Think, Therefore Diffuse: Enabling Multimodal In-Context Reasoning in Diffusion Models Zhenxing Mi 1 Kuan-Chieh Wang 2 Guocheng Qian 2 Hanrong Ye 1 Runtao Liu 1 Sergey Tulyakov 2 Kfir Aberman 2 Dan Xu 1 5 2 0 2 2 1 ] .

Abstract This paper presents ThinkDiff, novel alignment paradigm that empowers text-to-image diffusion models with multimodal in-context understanding and reasoning capabilities by integrating the strengths of vision-language models (VLMs). Existing multimodal diffusion finetuning methods largely focus on pixel-level reconstruction rather than in-context reasoning, and are constrained by the complexity and limited availability of reasoning-based datasets. ThinkDiff addresses these challenges by leveraging vision-language training as proxy task, aligning VLMs with the decoder of an encoder-decoder large language model (LLM) instead of diffusion decoder. This proxy task builds on the observation that the LLM decoder shares the same input feature space with diffusion decoders that use the corresponding LLM encoder for prompt embedding. As result, aligning VLMs with diffusion decoders can be simplified through alignment with the LLM decoder. Without complex training and datasets, ThinkDiff effectively unleashes understanding, reasoning, and composing capabilities in diffusion models.

[ 1 3 8 0 9 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract The pervasiveness of large language models and generative AI in online media has amplified the need for effective automated fact-checking to assist fact-checkers in tackling the increasing volume and sophistication of misinformation. The complex nature of fact-checking demands that automated fact-checking systems provide explanations that enable fact-checkers to scrutinise their outputs. However, it is unclear how these explanations should align with the decision-making and reasoning processes of fact-checkers to be effectively integrated into their workflows. Through semistructured interviews with fact-checking professionals, we bridge this gap by: (i) providing an account of how fact-checkers assess evidence, make decisions, and explain their processes; (ii) examining how fact-checkers use automated tools in practice; and (iii) identifying fact-checker explanation requirements for automated fact-checking tools. The findings show unmet explanation needs and identify important criteria for replicable fact-checking explanations that trace the models reasoning path, reference specific evidence, and highlight uncertainty and information gaps.

Leveraging the violation-of-expectation framework, we find that video prediction models trained to predict outcomes in learned representation space demonstrate an understanding of various intuitive physics properties, such as object permanence and shape consistency. In contrast, video prediction in pixel space and multimodal large language models, which reason through text, achieve performance closer to chance. Our comparisons of these architectures reveal that jointly learning an abstract representation space while predicting missing parts of sensory input, akin to predictive coding, is sufficient to acquire an understanding of intuitive physics, and that even models trained on one week of unique video achieve above chance performance. This challenges the idea that core knowledge set of innate systems to help understand the world needs to be hardwired to develop an understanding of intuitive physics.

Text:"Towards Data-Efficient Pretraining for Atomic Property Prediction Yasir Ghunaim 1 Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud 1 Bernard Ghanem 1 5 2 0 2 6 1 ] . [ 1 5 8 0 1 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r aThis paper challenges the recent paradigm in atomic property prediction that links progress to growing dataset sizes and computational resources. We show that pretraining on carefully selected, task-relevant dataset can match or even surpass large-scale pretraining, while using as little as 1/24th of the computational cost. We introduce the Chemical Similarity Index (CSI), novel metric inspired by computer visions Frechet Inception Distance, for molecular graphs which quantifies the alignment between upstream pretraining datasets and downstream tasks. By selecting the most relevant dataset with minimal CSI distance, we show that models pretrained on smaller, focused dataset consistently outperform those pretrained on massive, mixed datasets such as JMP, even when those larger datasets include the relevant dataset. Counterintuitively, we also find that indiscriminately adding more data can degrade model performance when the additional data poorly aligns with the task at hand. Our findings highlight that quality often outperforms quantity in pretraining for atomic property prediction. 1. Introduction Machine learning is transforming molecular modeling, driving advancements in accurate predictions and simulations of molecular behavior (Chanussot et al., 2021; Tran et al., 2023; Liao et al., 2023). These breakthroughs directly impact the acceleration of progress in crucial fields such as drug discovery (Huang et al., 2021) and global climate change mitigation (Sriram et al., 2024). The improvements in this field have been primarily attributed to innovations in model architectures (Liao et al., 2023; Gasteiger et al., 2021; Passaro & Zitnick, 2023) and the growing availability of large-scale molecular datasets. In recent years, the sizes of molecular datasets have increased dramatically - from tens of thou1King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.

Pretraining on carefully selected high-quality dataset achieves comparable or superior mean absolute error (MAE) across tasks while reducing computational cost by factor of 24 compared to JMP-S, which is pretrained on all upstream datasets. Lower MAE indicates better performance. sands of examples (Christensen & Von Lilienfeld, 2020; Chmiela et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2018) to hundreds of millions (Chanussot et al., 2021; Tran et al., 2023). This rapid growth in scale has also caused surge in the computational resources required for pretraining, increasing from few days on single GPU to over thousand GPU-days (Shoghi et al., 2023; Liao et al., 2023). This trend begs the question: (cid:17) Is scaling data and resources the only path forward in atomic property prediction, or can intelligent data selection achieve similar performance more efficiently? While data selection strategies for pretraining have been explored in fields like natural language processing (Penedo et al., 2024) and computer vision (Hammoud et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023), this area remains largely underexplored in atomic property prediction, where unique challenges arise. In his paper, we challenge the prevailing assumption that bigger is better by exploring whether smaller, strategically selected dataset can lead to comparable or even superior performance while substantially reducing computational demands. We introduce pretraining paradigm that shifts the focus from data and compute scaling to selecting the most relevant upstream dataset for improved downstream performance. Through simple baseline, our experiments reveal two key insights: Towards Data-Efficient Pretraining for Atomic Property Prediction (1) Competitive Performance Can Be Achieved with 24 Fewer Resources: Selecting upstream datasets based on their relevance to the downstream task achieves performance on par with or exceeding that of large-scale pretrained models like JMP (Shoghi et al., 2023) while utilizing only 1/24th of the computational resources, as shown in Figure 1. (2) Quality Outperforms Quantity: Expanding the pretraining dataset by incorporating additional data from less relevant sources can negatively impact downstream performance rather than enhance it. explore the potential of dataset selection for pretraining in atomic property prediction, we introduce the Chemical Similarity Index (CSI), simple metric inspired by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) from computer vision. CSI measures the alignment between an upstream dataset and downstream task, enabling the selection of chemically relevant pretraining data. By focusing on these highly relevant datasets, we significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining competitive performance and, in many cases, achieving improvements. While large-scale datasets like OC20 (Chanussot et al., 2021; Tran et al., 2023) and mixed datasets like JMP (Shoghi et al., 2023) are popular choices for pretraining in molecular domains (Kolluru et al., 2022; Shoghi et al., 2023), our findings challenge their universal utility. Surprisingly, pretraining on single, carefully selected dataset guided by CSI often outperforms models trained on mixtures, even when those include the most relevant dataset. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) We introduce novel framework for computationally efficient pretraining of molecular machine learning models, demonstrating that strategic data selection can match or outperform models trained on much larger datasets. (2) We propose the Chemical Similarity Index (CSI), metric for assessing the similarity between upstream and downstream molecular datasets, enabling effective dataset selection. (3) We provide an extensive empirical evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach, offering practical and efficient alternative to the current trend of ever-increasing data and computational costs in molecular machine learning. 2.

This paper presents ThinkDiff, a novel alignment paradigm that empowers text-to-image diffusion models with multimodal in-context understanding and reasoning capabilities by integrating the strengths of vision-language models (VLMs). Existing multimodal diffusion finetuning methods largely focus on pixel-level reconstruction rather than in-context reasoning, and are constrained by the complexity and limited availability of reasoning-based datasets. ThinkDiff addresses these challenges by leveraging vision-language training as a proxy task, aligning VLMs with the decoder of an encoder-decoder large language model (LLM) instead of a diffusion decoder. This proxy task builds on the observation that the LLM decoder shares the same input feature space with diffusion decoders that use the corresponding LLM encoder for prompt embedding. As a result, aligning VLMs with diffusion decoders can be simplified through alignment with the LLM decoder. Without complex training and datasets, ThinkDiff effectively unleashes understanding, reasoning, and composing capabilities in diffusion models. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkDiff significantly improves accuracy from 19.2% to 46.3% on the challenging CoBSAT benchmark for multimodal in-context reasoning generation, with only 5 hours of training on 4 A100 GPUs. Additionally, ThinkDiff demonstrates exceptional performance in composing multiple images and texts into logically coherent images. Project page: https://mizhenxing.github.io/ThinkDiff.

The pervasiveness of large language models and generative AI in online media has amplified the need for effective automated fact-checking to assist fact-checkers in tackling the increasing volume and sophistication of misinformation. The complex nature of fact-checking demands that automated fact-checking systems provide explanations that enable fact-checkers to scrutinise their outputs. However, it is unclear how these explanations should align with the decision-making and reasoning processes of fact-checkers to be effectively integrated into their workflows. Through semi-structured interviews with fact-checking professionals, we bridge this gap by: (i) providing an account of how fact-checkers assess evidence, make decisions, and explain their processes; (ii) examining how fact-checkers use automated tools in practice; and (iii) identifying fact-checker explanation requirements for automated fact-checking tools. The findings show unmet explanation needs and identify important criteria for replicable fact-checking explanations that trace the model's reasoning path, reference specific evidence, and highlight uncertainty and information gaps.

With the explosive growth of 3D content creation, there is an increasing demand for automatically converting static 3D models into articulation-ready versions that support realistic animation. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual annotation, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, the lack of large-scale benchmarks has hindered the development of learning-based solutions. In this work, we present MagicArticulate, an effective framework that automatically transforms static 3D models into articulation-ready assets. Our key contributions are threefold. First, we introduce Articulation-XL, a large-scale benchmark containing over 33k 3D models with high-quality articulation annotations, carefully curated from Objaverse-XL. Second, we propose a novel skeleton generation method that formulates the task as a sequence modeling problem, leveraging an auto-regressive transformer to naturally handle varying numbers of bones or joints within skeletons and their inherent dependencies across different 3D models. Third, we predict skinning weights using a functional diffusion process that incorporates volumetric geodesic distance priors between vertices and joints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicArticulate significantly outperforms existing methods across diverse object categories, achieving high-quality articulation that enables realistic animation.

We investigate the emergence of intuitive physics understanding in general-purpose deep neural network models trained to predict masked regions in natural videos. Leveraging the violation-of-expectation framework, we find that video prediction models trained to predict outcomes in a learned representation space demonstrate an understanding of various intuitive physics properties, such as object permanence and shape consistency. In contrast, video prediction in pixel space and multimodal large language models, which reason through text, achieve performance closer to chance. Our comparisons of these architectures reveal that jointly learning an abstract representation space while predicting missing parts of sensory input, akin to predictive coding, is sufficient to acquire an understanding of intuitive physics, and that even models trained on one week of unique video achieve above chance performance. This challenges the idea that core knowledge -- a set of innate systems to help understand the world -- needs to be hardwired to develop an understanding of intuitive physics.

This paper challenges the recent paradigm in atomic property prediction that links progress to growing dataset sizes and computational resources. We show that pretraining on a carefully selected, task-relevant dataset can match or even surpass large-scale pretraining, while using as little as 1/24th of the computational cost. We introduce the Chemical Similarity Index (CSI), a novel metric inspired by computer vision's Fr\'echet Inception Distance, for molecular graphs which quantifies the alignment between upstream pretraining datasets and downstream tasks. By selecting the most relevant dataset with minimal CSI distance, we show that models pretrained on a smaller, focused dataset consistently outperform those pretrained on massive, mixed datasets such as JMP, even when those larger datasets include the relevant dataset. Counterintuitively, we also find that indiscriminately adding more data can degrade model performance when the additional data poorly aligns with the task at hand. Our findings highlight that quality often outperforms quantity in pretraining for atomic property prediction.

Они вводят новую метрику - Индекс Химического Сходства (CSI), вдохновленную расстоянием Фреше в компьютерном зрении, для молекулярных графов. Исследование показывает, что модели, предобученные на меньшем, но целевом датасете, стабильно превосходят модели, предобученные на огромных смешанных датасетах.",
