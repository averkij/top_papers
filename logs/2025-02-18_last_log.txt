Text:"CRANE: Reasoning with constrained LLM generation Debangshu Banerjee 1 * Tarun Suresh 1 * Shubham Ugare 1 Sasa Misailovic 1 Gagandeep SinghCode generation, symbolic math reasoning, and other tasks require LLMs to produce outputs that are both syntactically and semantically correct. Constrained LLM generation is promising direction to enforce adherence to formal grammar, but prior works have empirically observed that strict enforcement of formal constraints often diminishes the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this work, we first provide theoretical explanation for why constraining LLM outputs to very restrictive grammars that only allow syntactically valid final answers reduces the reasoning capabilities of the model. Second, we demonstrate that by augmenting the output grammar with carefully designed additional rules, it is always possible to preserve the reasoning capabilities of the LLM while ensuring syntactic and semantic correctness in its outputs. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose reasoning-augmented constrained decoding algorithm, CRANE, which effectively balances the correctness of constrained generation with the flexibility of unconstrained generation.

[ 1 1 6 0 9 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r 1. Introduction Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are widely used in AI systems that interact with traditional software tools like Python interpreters (OpenAI, 2024; Chen et al., 2023) for code generation (Suresh et al., 2024a;b; *Equal contribution 1Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, USA. Correspondence to: Debangshu Banerjee <db21@illinois.edu>. Proceedings of the 42 nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada. PMLR 267, 2025. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 Jiang et al., 2024), logical solvers (Pan et al., 2023; Olausson et al., 2023), and theorem provers (Wu et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023). These tools impose specific syntactic and semantic constraints on their inputs, requiring LLMs to produce outputs in the correct format. For instance, if an LLM provides output to specific logical solver (Han et al., 2024), the output must be parsable by that solver. Similarly, Wolfram Alpha (wolfram, 2024) translates user queries about mathematical problems into domain-specific language (DSL) to utilize symbolic solvers. However, as highlighted in recent studies (Ugare et al., 2024b; Lundberg et al., 2023; Poesia et al., 2022), pre-trained LLM outputs do not always comply with downstream tools input requirements. Constrained decoding algorithms (Ugare et al., 2024b; Poesia et al., 2022) address this issue by projecting the LLM output onto user-specified formal constraints (e.g., syntactic rules defined by context-free grammar G), thereby ensuring that the input requirements of downstream tasks are satisfied. As illustrated in Fig. 1, constrained decoding improves the syntactic correctness of LLM outputs (e.g., generating well-formed mathematical expression). However, it does not guarantee functional correctness (e.g., ensuring the expression correctly answers the users query). Recent works such as Tam et al. (2024) have empirically observed that imposing constraints on LLM outputs can, in some cases, reduce functional correctness for specific tasks. Tam et al. (2024) attributes this reduction in functional accuracy to decline in the LLMs reasoning capabilities under constrained decoding. This observation raises the following open questions: RQ1: Do LLMs truly lose reasoning capabilities under constrained decoding? RQ2: How can we leverage the benefits of constrained decoding in reducing syntax errors while preserving the unconstrained reasoning capabilities of LLMs? Key Challenges: First, we need to formally identify the root cause of the reduction in functional accuracy of endto-end systems when pre-trained LLM operates under constrained generation. Unlike the empirical observations in (Tam et al., 2024), we seek formal justification for this reduction that is not limited to specific LLMs used in experiments but extends to any LLM, including more CRANE: Reasoning with constrained LLM generation Figure 1. An example from the GSM-symbolic dataset (variables in blue) where unconstrained generation produces syntactically incorrect output, while constrained generation provides syntactically valid but incorrect answer. CRANE, however, generates correct answer. powerful ones developed in the future. Second, we must design cost-efficient decoding strategies that address the shortcomings of existing constrained decoding methods while improving functional accuracy. In this work, we do not consider task-specific fine-tuning of LLMs, as fine-tuning for each task is compute-intensive. Unlike constrained decoding, fine-tuning does not guarantee that the LLM output adheres to formal constraints. Contributions: We make the following contributions to improve the functional accuracy of the end-to-end system: We theoretically show that LLMs with constant number of layers, which are known to be capable of simulating steps of any given Turing machine with O(n) reasoning steps (Merrill & Sabharwal, 2024), can only solve problems within relatively restrictive circuit complexity class when constrained to generate outputs that always conform to restrictive grammar defining only the valid output strings. This demonstrates that, for restrictive grammar, constrained decoding reduces the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. We theoretically show that the loss of expressivity of LLMs under constrained decoding arises because the output grammar is too restrictive to accommodate the intermediate reasoning steps required to compute the answer. We further demonstrate that augmenting the grammar with specific additional production rules enables the LLM to generate the intermediate reasoning steps while ensuring that the final output always adheres to the intended output structure. With the augmented grammar Ga, the LLM retains its expressivity under constrained decoding. We propose simple and cost-efficient decoding strategy, CRANE (Constrained Reasoning Augmented Generation). CRANE effectively alternates betwe"

Text-to-SQL aims to convert natural language questions into executable SQL queries. While previous approaches, such as skeleton-masked selection, have demonstrated strong performance by retrieving similar training examples to guide large language models (LLMs), they struggle in real-world scenarios where such examples are unavailable. To overcome this limitation, we propose Self-Augmentation in-context learning with Fine-grained Example selection for Text-to-SQL (SAFE-SQL), a novel framework that improves SQL generation by generating and filtering self-augmented examples. SAFE-SQL first prompts an LLM to generate multiple Text-to-SQL examples relevant to the test input. Then SAFE-SQL filters these examples through three relevance assessments, constructing high-quality in-context learning examples. Using self-generated examples, SAFE-SQL surpasses the previous zero-shot, and few-shot Text-to-SQL frameworks, achieving higher execution accuracy. Notably, our approach provides additional performance gains in extra hard and unseen scenarios, where conventional methods often fail.

"Code generation, symbolic math reasoning, and other tasks require LLMs to produce outputs that are both syntactically and semantically correct. Constrained LLM generation is a promising direction to enforce adherence to formal grammar, but prior works have empirically observed that strict enforcement of formal constraints often diminishes the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this work, we first provide a theoretical explanation for why constraining LLM outputs to very restrictive grammars that only allow syntactically valid final answers reduces the reasoning capabilities of the model. Second, we demonstrate that by augmenting the output grammar with carefully designed additional rules, it is always possible to preserve the reasoning capabilities of the LLM while ensuring syntactic and semantic correctness in its outputs. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose a reasoning-augmented constrained decoding algorithm, CRANE, which effectively balances the correctness of constrained generation with the flexibility of unconstrained generation. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs and benchmarks show that CRANE significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art constrained decoding strategies and standard unconstrained decoding, showing up to 10% points accuracy improvement over baselines on challenging symbolic reasoning benchmarks GSM-symbolic and FOLIO."
