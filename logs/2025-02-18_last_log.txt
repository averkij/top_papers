[18.02.2025 12:19] Abstract 1. Long-context modeling is crucial for next-generation language models, yet the high computational cost of standard attention mechanisms poses significant computational challenges.

[18.02.2025 12:19] Abstract 2. Current unlearning methods for large language models usually rely on reverse optimization to reduce target token probabilities.

[18.02.2025 12:19] Abstract 5. Despite exceptional capabilities in knowledge-intensive tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) face a critical gap in understanding how they internalize new knowledge, particularly how to structurally embed acquired knowledge in their neural computations. We address this issue through the lens of knowl...

[18.02.2025 12:19] Abstract 6. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks, such as code understanding and code generation. However, an equally important yet underexplored question is whether LLMs can serve as general-purpose surrogate code executors, to predict the output and beha...

[18.02.2025 12:19] Abstract 10. Code generation, symbolic math reasoning, and other tasks require LLMs to produce outputs that are both syntactically and semantically correct.

We present Dyve, a dynamic process verifier that enhances reasoning error detection in large language models by integrating fast and slow thinking, inspired by Kahneman's Systems Theory. Dyve adaptively applies immediate token-level confirmation System 1 for straightforward steps and comprehensive analysis System 2 for complex ones. Leveraging a novel step-wise consensus-filtered process supervision technique, combining Monte Carlo estimation with LLM based evaluation, Dyve curates high-quality supervision signals from noisy data. Experimental results on ProcessBench and the MATH dataset confirm that Dyve significantly outperforms existing process-based verifiers and boosts performance in Best-of-N settings.

Memory is crucial for enabling agents to tackle complex tasks with temporal and spatial dependencies. While many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms incorporate memory, the field lacks a universal benchmark to assess an agent's memory capabilities across diverse scenarios. This gap is particularly evident in tabletop robotic manipulation, where memory is essential for solving tasks with partial observability and ensuring robust performance, yet no standardized benchmarks exist. To address this, we introduce MIKASA (Memory-Intensive Skills Assessment Suite for Agents), a comprehensive benchmark for memory RL, with three key contributions: (1) we propose a comprehensive classification framework for memory-intensive RL tasks, (2) we collect MIKASA-Base - a unified benchmark that enables systematic evaluation of memory-enhanced agents across diverse scenarios, and (3) we develop MIKASA-Robo - a novel benchmark of 32 carefully designed memory-intensive tasks that assess memory capabilities in tabletop robotic manipulation. Our contributions establish a unified framework for advancing memory RL research, driving the development of more reliable systems for real-world applications.
