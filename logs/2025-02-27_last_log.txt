Text:"Scaling LLM Pre-training with Vocabulary Curriculum Fangyuan Yu TemusModern language models rely on static vocabularies, fixed before pretraining, in contrast to the adaptive vocabulary acquisition observed in human language learning. To bridge this gap, we introduce vocabulary curriculum learning, an approach that improves pretraining efficiency with log-linear scaling gains relative to vocabulary size. Our method alternates between entropy-guided vocabulary expansion and model optimization, enabling models to learn transferable representations across diverse tokenization granularities. This approach naturally gives rise to an optimal computation allocation pattern: longer tokens capture predictable content, while shorter tokens focus on more complex, harder-to-predict contexts. Experiments on small-scale GPT models demonstrate improved scaling efficiency, reinforcing the effectiveness of dynamic tokenization. We release our code to support further research and plan to extend our experiments to larger models and diverse domains.5 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 0 1 9 7 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Scaling better with vocabulary curriculum Modern language model pre-training relies on static vocabularies, fixed before training and detached from the models learning dynamicsunlike human language acquisition. This fixed approach limits Preprint. Under review. models ability to adapt to different levels of linguistic granularity, potentially hindering efficiency and performance. While humans acquire language hierarchically, starting with basic units before building more complex representations, language models typically operate with predetermined tokenization schemes. Our approach dynamically merges predictable tokens, enabling the model to allocate computational resources more efficiently and shift focus toward harder-to-predict patterns. This results in an adaptive curriculum that evolves alongside the models capabilities. The vocabulary curriculum learning strategy begins with basic units (characters) and progressively expands to more complex representations, allocating more capacity to regions of high modeling entropy and refining the models understanding of difficult linguistic structures. digram of our approach is provided in 2 Empirical results from pre-training GPT models [10] on the enwiki8 dataset [11] highlight two key advantages of our vocabulary curriculum learning approach: 1. It improves model performance across various vocabulary sizes, consistently achieving lower bits-per-character (BPC) compared to traditional fixed-vocabulary training. 2. It enhances scaling efficiencymodels trained with vocabulary curriculum exhibit shallower slope (0.109 vs. 0.147) in log-scale vocabulary size vs. BPC plots, indicating more effective utilization of larger vocabularies. As shown in Figure 1, models trained with incremental vocabulary curriculum learning (red) exhibit steeper improvement curve compared to compute-matching baselines (blue). The log-scale vocabulary size vs. bits-per-character (BPC) plot reveals that vocabulary curriculum learning achieves slope of -0.147, meaning it leverages larger vocabularies more effectively than compute-matching learning, which only reaches -0.109. Additionally, we observe that the curated vocabulary naturally forms hierarchical structure, where longer tokens become increasingly predictable (lower BPC), while shorter tokens remain harder to predict (higher BPC). This structural organization emerges organically from our training process, reinforcing the effectiveness of our dynamic tokenization strategy. Our key contributions are: dynamic vocabulary creation system that adapts based on model entropy curriculum learning approach for tokenization that improves scaling efficiency Evidence that hierarchical token organization emerges naturally from our approach While our focus is on language modeling, we believe this scaling effect can generalize to other modalities and domains, as byte sequences serve as the fundamental building blocks of digital data.2.1 Tokenization Methods and Limitations Standard tokenization approaches like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) [8], [9] rely on static co-occurrence statistics detached from model learning. This creates representational limitations, particularly evident in early language models struggles with mathematical operations [10]. Naive BPE tokenization produces inconsistent representations of numbersfor example, "711" might be encoded as single token while "703" requires multiple tokens. This inconsistency makes it harder for models to learn arithmetic operations compared to specialized approaches that assign unique tokens to all 1-3 digit integers [7]. Even with fixed vocabulary, different encoding strategies can produce varying segmentations of the same text. BPE-dropout [2] leverages this property by introducing stochasticity during training, showing improvements in neural machine translation. More recent work exploits segmentation equivariance during inference to enhance reasoning through self-consistency [3]. Additionally, research [5] has established the existence of optimal vocabulary sizes for BPE-style tokenization, which correlate with model size, log-linear relationship is observed between perplexity and vocabulary size. 2 Figure 2: Scaling better with vocabulary curriculum 2.2 Curriculum Learning Curriculum learning [13] progressively increases task difficulty during training to improve model performance. While successful in LLM post-training [15, 21], effective curriculum strategies for pretraining remain challenging [16]. Previous attempts at vocabulary-based curricula for decoder-only models found no improvements [19], highlighting the difficulty of designing effective curricula for language model pre-training. Our work addresses these limitations with novel adaptive approach to vocabulary curriculum. 2.3 Entropy Aware Tokenization Recent work has begun exploring entropy-aware tokenization. The Byte Latent Transformer [4] builds tokenization vocabularies using separately trained small language models. However, this approach creates vocabularies that are detached from the actual models entropy patterns and cannot be dynamically updated during training. Our work differs by integrating vocabulary building directly into the training process, allowing the tokenization scheme to evolve with the models developing understanding of the text. This creates true curriculum that adapts to the specific learning trajectory of each"

Modern language models rely on static vocabularies, fixed before pretraining, in contrast to the adaptive vocabulary acquisition observed in human language learning. To bridge this gap, we introduce vocabulary curriculum learning, an approach that improves pretraining efficiency with log-linear scaling gains relative to vocabulary size. Our method alternates between entropy-guided vocabulary expansion and model optimization, enabling models to learn transferable representations across diverse tokenization granularities. This approach naturally gives rise to an optimal computation allocation pattern: longer tokens capture predictable content, while shorter tokens focus on more complex, harder-to-predict contexts. Experiments on small-scale GPT models demonstrate improved scaling efficiency, reinforcing the effectiveness of dynamic tokenization. We release our code to support further research and plan to extend our experiments to larger models and diverse domains.
