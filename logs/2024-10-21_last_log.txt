Attention is the cornerstone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet its quadratic complexity limits the efficiency and scalability of LLMs, especially for those with a long-context window. A promising approach addressing this limitation is to leverage the sparsity in attention. However, existing sparsity-based solutions predominantly rely on predefined patterns or heuristics to approximate sparsity. This practice falls short to fully capture the dynamic nature of attention sparsity in language-based tasks. This paper argues that attention sparsity should be learned rather than predefined. To this end, we design SeerAttention, a new Attention mechanism that augments the conventional attention with a learnable gate that adaptively selects significant blocks in an attention map and deems the rest blocks sparse. Such block-level sparsity effectively balances accuracy and speedup. To enable efficient learning of the gating network, we develop a customized FlashAttention implementation that extracts the block-level ground truth of attention map with minimum overhead. SeerAttention not only applies to post-training, but also excels in long-context fine-tuning. Our results show that at post-training stages, SeerAttention significantly outperforms state-of-the-art static or heuristic-based sparse attention methods, while also being more versatile and flexible to adapt to varying context lengths and sparsity ratios. When applied to long-context fine-tuning with YaRN, SeerAttention can achieve a remarkable 90% sparsity ratio at a 32k context length with minimal perplexity loss, offering a 5.67x speedup over FlashAttention-2.

This paper introduces the UCFE: User-Centric Financial Expertise benchmark, an innovative framework designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to handle complex real-world financial tasks. UCFE benchmark adopts a hybrid approach that combines human expert evaluations with dynamic, task-specific interactions to simulate the complexities of evolving financial scenarios. Firstly, we conducted a user study involving 804 participants, collecting their feedback on financial tasks. Secondly, based on this feedback, we created our dataset that encompasses a wide range of user intents and interactions. This dataset serves as the foundation for benchmarking 12 LLM services using the LLM-as-Judge methodology. Our results show a significant alignment between benchmark scores and human preferences, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78, confirming the effectiveness of the UCFE dataset and our evaluation approach. UCFE benchmark not only reveals the potential of LLMs in the financial sector but also provides a robust framework for assessing their performance and user satisfaction.The benchmark dataset and evaluation code are available.

A huge number of detectors and collections with AI fragments have emerged, and several detection methods even showed recognition quality up to 99.9% according to the target metrics in such collections. However, the quality of such detectors tends to drop dramatically in the wild, posing a question: Are detectors actually highly trustworthy or do their high benchmark scores come from the poor quality of evaluation datasets? In this paper, we emphasise the need for robust and qualitative methods for evaluating generated data to be secure against bias and low generalising ability of future model. We present a systematic review of datasets from competitions dedicated to AI-generated content detection and propose methods for evaluating the quality of datasets containing AI-generated fragments. In addition, we discuss the possibility of using high-quality generated data to achieve two goals: improving the training of detection models and improving the training datasets themselves. Our contribution aims to facilitate a better understanding of the dynamics between human and machine text, which will ultimately support the integrity of information in an increasingly automated world.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become the predominant approach for language model (LM) alignment. At its core, RLHF uses a margin-based loss for preference optimization, specifying ideal LM behavior only by the difference between preferred and dispreferred responses. In this paper, we identify a common pitfall of margin-based methods -- the under-specification of ideal LM behavior on preferred and dispreferred responses individually, which leads to two unintended consequences as the margin increases: (1) The probability of dispreferred (e.g., unsafe) responses may increase, resulting in potential safety alignment failures. (2) The probability of preferred responses may decrease, even when those responses are ideal. We demystify the reasons behind these problematic behaviors: margin-based losses couple the change in the preferred probability to the gradient of the dispreferred one, and vice versa, often preventing the preferred probability from increasing while the dispreferred one decreases, and thus causing a synchronized increase or decrease in both probabilities. We term this effect, inherent in margin-based objectives, gradient entanglement. Formally, we derive conditions for general margin-based alignment objectives under which gradient entanglement becomes concerning: the inner product of the gradients of preferred and dispreferred log-probabilities is large relative to the individual gradient norms. We theoretically investigate why such inner products can be large when aligning language models and empirically validate our findings. Empirical implications of our framework extend to explaining important differences in the training dynamics of various preference optimization algorithms, and suggesting potential algorithm designs to mitigate the under-specification issue of margin-based methods and thereby improving language model alignment.

Proteins are essential macromolecules defined by their amino acid sequences, which determine their three-dimensional structures and, consequently, their functions in all living organisms. Therefore, generative protein modeling necessitates a multimodal approach to simultaneously model, understand, and generate both sequences and structures. However, existing methods typically use separate models for each modality, limiting their ability to capture the intricate relationships between sequence and structure. This results in suboptimal performance in tasks that requires joint understanding and generation of both modalities. In this paper, we introduce DPLM-2, a multimodal protein foundation model that extends discrete diffusion protein language model (DPLM) to accommodate both sequences and structures. To enable structural learning with the language model, 3D coordinates are converted to discrete tokens using a lookup-free quantization-based tokenizer. By training on both experimental and high-quality synthetic structures, DPLM-2 learns the joint distribution of sequence and structure, as well as their marginals and conditionals. We also implement an efficient warm-up strategy to exploit the connection between large-scale evolutionary data and structural inductive biases from pre-trained sequence-based protein language models. Empirical evaluation shows that DPLM-2 can simultaneously generate highly compatible amino acid sequences and their corresponding 3D structures eliminating the need for a two-stage generation approach. Moreover, DPLM-2 demonstrates competitive performance in various conditional generation tasks, including folding, inverse folding, and scaffolding with multimodal motif inputs, as well as providing structure-aware representations for predictive tasks.

Does the People's Republic of China (PRC) interfere with European elections through ethnic Chinese diaspora media? This question forms the basis of an ongoing research project exploring how PRC narratives about European elections are represented in Chinese diaspora media, and thus the objectives of PRC news media manipulation. In order to study diaspora media efficiently and at scale, it is necessary to use techniques derived from quantitative text analysis, such as topic modelling. In this paper, we present a pipeline for studying information dynamics in Chinese media. Firstly, we present KeyNMF, a new approach to static and dynamic topic modelling using transformer-based contextual embedding models. We provide benchmark evaluations to demonstrate that our approach is competitive on a number of Chinese datasets and metrics. Secondly, we integrate KeyNMF with existing methods for describing information dynamics in complex systems. We apply this pipeline to data from five news sites, focusing on the period of time leading up to the 2024 European parliamentary elections.

""Does the People's Republic of China (PRC) interfere with European elections through ethnic Chinese diaspora media? This question forms the basis of an ongoing research project exploring how PRC narratives about European elections are represented in Chinese diaspora media, and thus the objectives of PRC news media manipulation. In order to study diaspora media efficiently and at scale, it is necessary to use techniques derived from quantitative text analysis, such as topic modelling. In this paper, we present a pipeline for studying information dynamics in Chinese media. Firstly, we present KeyNMF, a new approach to static and dynamic topic modelling using transformer-based contextual embedding models. We provide benchmark evaluations to demonstrate that our approach is competitive on a number of Chinese datasets and metrics. Secondly, we integrate KeyNMF with existing methods for describing information dynamics in complex systems. We apply this pipeline to data from five news sites, focusing on the period of time leading up to the 2024 European parliamentary elections. Our methods and results demonstrate the effectiveness of KeyNMF for studying information dynamics in Chinese media and lay groundwork for further work addressing the broader research questions.
