[ 1 6 7 5 0 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r aWhile Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with particular focus on deep understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks. Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks. Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from contextual analysis of the interlocutors needs and emotions, with reasoning ability serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ multi-stage, modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results. Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also enhance the performance of nonreasoning models in training-free manner. Project page: https://digital-avatar.github.io/ai/HumanSense/ Introduction Science fiction (Quantic Dream 2018; her 2013) often portrays future where artificial intelligence serves not merely as tool for task execution, but as human companion offering social support and emotional connection. The fundamental evolution from narrow, task-oriented systems to Artificial General Intelligence is predicated on the capacity to comprehend human intentions from speech, expressions, and body language, thereby enabling appropriate responses. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) (Xu et al. 2025; Hurst et al. 2024; Anthropic 2024; Team et al. 2023) Co-first author. Project Corresponding author. 1National Key Laboratory of Human-Machine Hybrid Augmented Intelligence, National Engineering Research Center for Visual Information and Applications, Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xian Jiaotong University. 2Ant Group. lead. represent promising pathway toward realizing this vision. Their ability to holistically process visual, auditory, and textual information enables comprehensive understanding of users and environments. MLLMs also have the potential to deeply analyze perceived information (Guo et al. 2025) and subsequently plan appropriate feedback, which is not limited to textual responses, but can include suitable emotions, tones, and gesture labels in temporal sequences. Such outputs can be further integrated with video generation (Meng et al. 2025; Qin et al. 2025), speech synthesis (Wang et al. 2023; Suno AI 2023), and talking head (Li et al. 2024c,b; Zhang et al. 2024c; Zheng et al. 2021) methods to provide highly anthropomorphic interactive experience. Achieving this goal first requires defining the necessary capabilities, evaluating model performance, and then applying optimization. However, existing benchmarks (Qi et al. 2025; Lin et al. 2024; Hu et al. 2025) lack targeted, finegrained evaluation for these human-centered scenarios. To address this gap, we first define the primary capabilities needed for MLLMs in such scenarios: 1) multi-modal perception, 2) contextual understanding of implicit information, and 3) appropriate responses in multi-turn interactions. For interactive scenarios, we consider both response content and response strategies. Based on the above considerations, we propose the HumanSense benchmark. This benchmark comprises 15 progressively challenging tests, totaling 3,882 questions derived from real-world records. In interactive tests, MLLMs are tasked with assuming the role of one party in the interaction and generating responses, which are then compared to real human records. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of current leading MLLMs, including Vision-Language Models (Zhu et al. 2025; Team 2025), Omni models (Hurst et al. 2024; Xu et al. 2025), and Audio-Language Models (Chu et al. 2023). The results reveal significant room for improvement in human-centered scenarios, particularly in advanced interaction-oriented tasks. Modality ablation studies show that visual, auditory, and textual information all play crucial roles in high-level tasks, and omni models capable of jointly processing audio, video, and text exhibit clear advantage. Building on these findings, we propose that omni-modal reasoning can enhance the cognitive and interactive capabilities of MLLMs. This assertion stems from our observation that appropriate feedback in communication relies on thorFigure 1: Demonstration of tasks in HumanSense. Note: The questions above are slightly simplified for clarity and brevity. ough consideration of omni-modal context, the interlocutors needs, emotions, and personal characteristics. Accordingly, we employ multi-stage, omni-modal reinforcement learning approach to build reasoning omni model, resulting in substantial improvements in evaluations. Furthermore, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly consistent patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in training-free manner. The path to Artificial General Intelligence requires longterm, multifaceted exploration. With this work, we aim to inspire the community to explore the potential of Omni MLLMs for improving human-centered AI interactions and helps shape this emerging direction.Multimodal Large Language Models. LLMs (Bai et al. 2023; Mann et al. 2020; Radford et al. 2018, 2019; Touvron et al. 2023) have been extensively adopted for human behavior and sentiment analysis, facilitating applications including dialogue simulation, behavior prediction, and textual sentiment classification. These capabilities support diverse scenarios ranging from social media monitoring to automated customer support systems. However, textual information alone is "

A benchmark called PRELUDE evaluates long-context understanding by assessing the consistency of prequel stories with original books, revealing significant challenges for models compared to humans.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce PRELUDE, a benchmark for evaluating long-context understanding through the task of determining whether a character's prequel story is consistent with the canonical narrative of the original book. Our task poses a stronger demand for global comprehension and deep reasoning than existing benchmarks -- as the prequels are not part of the original story, assessing their plausibility typically requires searching and integrating information that is only indirectly related. Empirically, 88% of instances require evidence from multiple parts of the narrative. Experimental results highlight the challenge of our task: in-context learning, RAG and in-domain training with state-of-the-art LLMs, and commercial DeepResearch services, lag behind humans by >15%. A further human study reveals that models often produce correct answers with flawed reasoning, leading to an over 30% gap in reasoning accuracy compared to humans.

"A benchmark called PRELUDE evaluates long-context understanding by assessing the consistency of prequel stories with original books, revealing significant challenges for models compared to humans.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce PRELUDE, a benchmark for evaluating long-context understanding through the task of determining whether a character's prequel story is consistent with the canonical narrative of the original book. Our task poses a stronger demand for global comprehension and deep reasoning than existing benchmarks -- as the prequels are not part of the original story, assessing their plausibility typically requires searching and integrating information that is only indirectly related. Empirically, 88% of instances require evidence from multiple parts of the narrative. Experimental results highlight the challenge of our task: in-context learning, RAG and in-domain training with state-of-the-art LLMs, and commercial DeepResearch services, lag behind humans by >15%. A further human study reveals that models often produce correct answers with flawed reasoning, leading to an over 30% gap in reasoning accuracy compared to humans. These findings underscore the substantial room for improvement in long-context understanding and reasoning."

A multi-dimensional modeling framework enhances automated interpreting quality assessment by integrating feature engineering, data augmentation, and explainable machine learning, focusing on transparency and detailed diagnostic feedback.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in machine learning have spurred growing interests in automated interpreting quality assessment. Nevertheless, existing research suffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory modeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of efforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a multi-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data augmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes explainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only construct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP) analysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and CometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity, pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological diversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on explainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to traditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not afforded by automated scores in isolation.

HumanSense is a benchmark for evaluating human-centered perception and interaction in Multimodal Large Language Models, focusing on multimodal context understanding and rational feedback through reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks. Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks. Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage, modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results. Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner. Project page: brightpinkhttps://digital-avatar.github.io/ai/HumanSense/
