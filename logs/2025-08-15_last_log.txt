[ 1 2 8 4 0 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r When Explainability Meets Privacy: An Investigation at the Intersection of Post-hoc Explainability and Differential Privacy in the Context of Natural Language Processing Mahdi Dhaini, Stephen Meisenbacher, Ege Erdogan, Florian Matthes, Gjergji Kasneci Technical University of Munich School of Computation, Information and Technology Department of Computer Science Munich, Germany {mahdi.dhaini, stephen.meisenbacher, ege.erdogan, matthes, gjergji.kasneci}@tum.de Abstract In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), number of important research fields have emerged, including that of explainability and privacy. While research interest in both explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent years, there remains lack of investigation at the intersection of the two. This leaves considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving both explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the popular overarching methods of Differential Privacy (DP) and Post-hoc Explainability. Our findings include view into the intricate relationship between privacy and explainability, which is formed by number of factors, including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important intersection. Code https://github.com/dmah10/xpnlp Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have seen bountiful and widespread improvements in the way natural language can be understood and generated. Such progress, hallmarked by the rapid developments enabled by Large Language Models (LLMs) and associated techniques, has po"

STream3R reformulates 3D reconstruction as a decoder-only Transformer problem, using causal attention to efficiently process image sequences and outperform existing methods in both static and dynamic scenes.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks. Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D understanding in streaming environments.

The study investigates the relationship between privacy and explainability in NLP, using Differential Privacy and Post-hoc Explainability methods, and provides recommendations for balancing both.  					AI-generated summary 				 In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of important research fields have emerged, including that of explainability and privacy. While research interest in both explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two. This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving both explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the popular overarching methods of Differential Privacy (DP) and Post-hoc Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors, including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important intersection.
