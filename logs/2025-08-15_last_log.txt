Project GitHub is available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/Awesome-DLMs. Index TermsDiffusion Language Model, Large Language Model, Diffusion Model, Diffusion Large Language Model, Language Modeling, Multimodal Language ModelR ECENT advancements towards artificial general intelligence (AGI) have been largely driven by the emergence of autoregressive large language models (LLMs) [1][7] and diffusion models for image and video generation [8][12], These models exhibit remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation across diverse modalities, achieving levels of performance that were previously unimaginable. The unprecedented scale of these models, reflected in massive parameter counts, vast datasets, substantial efforts in training, and significant computational demands during inference, has pushed AI to new heights, equipping these models with broad general knowledge and deep understanding of language and the real world. The rise of the GPT series [1], [13], [14], particularly with the public release of ChatGPT [2], has propelled autoregressive (AR) language models to dominant position in natural language processing. By training to predict the next token using causal attention and teacher forcing, AR models [4], [15], [16] can effectively scale to large datasets and model sizes. Generating text in sequential, tokenby-token fashion, AR models excel at supporting wide range of tasks, from simple question answering to complex reasoning and creative writing. However, this sequential nature imposes major bottleneck on inference speed. The autoregressive generation process, which produces one toTianyi Li, Mingda Chen, Bowei Guo, and Zhiqiang Shen are with VILA Lab, Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence.

E-mail: {Tianyi.Li, Bowei.Guo, Zhiqiang.Shen}@mbzuai.ac.ae, cmd22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn ken at time, inherently limits parallelism and significantly constrains computational efficiency and throughput. Diffusion models are another highly promising generative paradigm. They are trained to recover data from progressively noised versions through denoising process, and generate new samples by reversing this stochastic corruption step by step. Excelling at modeling complex data distributions, diffusion models have achieved stateof-the-art results in image and video synthesis [17]. Academic breakthroughs in diffusion modeling [18][21] have established solid theoretical foundation for training and inference. Concurrently, large-scale practical models like Stable Diffusion [8], [10], [11], Imagen [9], and Sora [12] demonstrate the remarkable scalability and generalization of diffusion paradigm, enabling generation of high-fidelity, art-level images and videos from simple text prompts often with just few words. Beyond their strong capacity for modeling complex data distributions, diffusion models offer an inherent advantage in parallelism. Through an iterative denoising process, they can generate multiple tokens or an entire sequence simultaneously, potentially leading to superior inference throughput and better utilization of modern parallel computing hardware. While challenges remain, particularly in modeling discrete data and handling dynamic sequence lengths, Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as compelling alternative to address the trade-off between generation quality and speed. To adapt diffusion for discrete language data, several key approaches have been proposed. In the early times, the development of DLMs was primarily driven by diffusion models success in continuous domains like image synthesis. Continuous DLMs map tokens into embeddings and perform denoising in continuous space, as in pioneer 5 2 0 2 4 1 ] . [ 1 5 7 8 0 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r Fig. 1. Timeline of Diffusion Language Models. This figure highlights key milestones in the development of DLMs, categorized into three groups: continuous DLMs, discrete DLMs, and recent multimodal DLMs. We observe that while early research predominantly focused on continuous DLMs, discrete DLMs have gained increasing popularity in more recent years. works Diffusion-LM [22] and SED [23]. Discrete DLMs, on the other hand, define the diffusion process directly in token space. Early efforts such as D3PM [24] introduced structured transition matrices with absorbing states, allowing tokenlevel corruption and iterative denoising. Subsequent work like DiffusionBERT [25] integrated pre-trained masked language models (e.g., BERT) to enhance denoising quality, and proposed tailored noise schedules (e.g., th"

"Diffusion Language Models offer parallel token generation, reducing inference latency and capturing bidirectional context, and are compared to autoregressive models in various NLP tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods. Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism, caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field. Project GitHub is available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/Awesome-DLMs."

Visual encoders encode subtle image acquisition parameters that can significantly impact semantic predictions based on their correlation with semantic labels.  					AI-generated summary 				 Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively, distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.   We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these acquisition-based or processing-based labels.
