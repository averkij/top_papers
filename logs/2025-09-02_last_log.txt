[ 1 0 6 0 9 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r No Label Left Behind: Unified Surface Defect Detection Model for all Supervision Regimes Blaˇz Rolih1*, Matic Fuˇcka1 and Danijel Skoˇcaj1 1*Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana, Veˇcna Pot 113, Ljubljana, 1000, Slovenia. *Corresponding author(s). E-mail(s): blaz.rolih@fri.uni-lj.si; Contributing authors: matic.fucka@fri.uni-lj.si; danijel.skocaj@fri.uni-lj.si; Abstract Surface defect detection is critical task across numerous industries, aimed at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability. Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we propose SuperSimpleNet, highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates novel synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets new standard for performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet represents promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial applications.
