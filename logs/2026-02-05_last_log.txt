Text:"I May Not Have Articulated Myself Clearly: Diagnosing Dynamic Instability in LLM Reasoning at Inference Time Jinkun Chen 1 Fengxiang Cheng 2 3 Sijia Han 4 Vlado KeseljReasoning failures in large language models (LLMs) are typically measured only at the end of generation, yet many failures manifest as process-level breakdown: the model loses the thread mid-reasoning. We study whether such breakdowns are detectable from inference-time observables available in standard APIs (token log probabilities), without any training or finetuning. We define simple instability signal that combines consecutive-step distributional shift (JSD) and uncertainty (entropy), summarize each trace by its peak instability strength, and show that this signal reliably predicts failure. Across GSM8K and HotpotQA, instability strength predicts wrong answers with above-chance AUC and yields monotonic bucket-level accuracy decline at scale across model sizes. Crucially, we show that instability is not uniformly harmful: early instability can reflect subsequent stabilization and correct final answer (corrective instability), whereas late instability is more often followed by failure (destructive instability), even at comparable peak magnitudes, indicating that recoverability depends not only on how strongly the distribution changes but also on when such changes occur relative to the remaining decoding horizon. The method is model-agnostic, training-free, and reproducible, and is presented as diagnostic lens rather than corrective or control mechanism. 6 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 3 6 8 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r 1.

February 4, 2026. 1 Figure 1. Inference-time dynamic instability as diagnostic signal. Conceptual overview of an inference-time diagnostic for dynamic instability in large language model reasoning. A: At each decoding step t, we observe only the renormalized top-k next-token distribution pt, which is accessible as black-box inference-time signal; no hidden states, gradients, or training access are required. B: An instability event is characterized by an abrupt reshuffling of probability mass among high-probability candidates, accompanied by increased uncertainty (higher entropy) between consecutive steps. C: We define diagnostic instability signal It = Dt + λHt, combining distributional shift Dt = JSD(pt, pt1) and uncertainty Ht. All quantities are computed solely from pt at inference time, with overall instability strength summarized as = maxt It. D: Instability strength is associated with increased failure risk, while the peak location (relative position ρ) provides complementary information, separating earlier (more recoverable/corrective) from later (less recoverable/destructive) instability episodes. of failures driven by dynamic instability, rather than by static knowledge limitations. Our goal is diagnostic rather than corrective: identify process-level indicators that reliably predict failure, without modifying the model. Motivation. In many applications, the relevant question is not only whether an answer is correct, but when the generation begins to break down and whether it is likely to recover. Final-answer accuracy is retrospective, and static confidence proxies can miss intra-trajectory transitions; conversely, multi-sample consistency methods require multiple runs. We therefore ask minimal inference-time question: can single decoding trace reveal an observable signature of unstable reasoning using only token probabilities? Figure 1 provides conceptual overview of our inference-time diagDiagnosing Dynamic Instability in LLM Reasoning nostic, illustrating what is observable at decoding time, how instability manifests in token distributions, and why instability strength and timing are predictive of reasoning failure. Unlike accuracy-oriented interventions, our analysis does not aim to improve correctness, but to characterize when and how reasoning processes become unstable. We focus on detecting and characterizing instability, not on correcting or controlling it. To avoid confusion with related notions, our instability signal is not confidence score, calibration method, hallucination detector, or verifier. It targets trajectory-level dynamical behavior rather than outcome-level uncertainty: two traces with similar average entropy can exhibit very different instability profiles, and only the latter reflects temporal disruption during reasoning. Why can the next-token distribution represent reasoning stability? Autoregressive decoding induces closed-loop state evolution in which the internal state updates based on previously generated tokens, yet the models token distribution is the only black-box observable of this evolving state. Small perturbations may therefore be amplified over time through this feedback loop. Formally, letting ht denote the internal state and xt the emitted token, ht+1 = (ht, xt), pt = g(ht), (1) where pt is the full next-token distribution; in black-box settings we observe pt, its top-k truncation and renormalization. We therefore study intra-trajectory temporal instability: abrupt changes in pt (or pt when truncated) over time within single trace. This differs from self-consistency and other sampling-based methods, which analyze intertrajectory variability across multiple samples. It also differs from static uncertainty: we do not treat entropy as standalone confidence score, but combine entropy with consecutive-step distributional shifts to quantify localized regime shifts during single generation. Prior work shows that LLMs often fail to identify their own reasoning errors without explicit localization, motivating process-level diagnostics of reasoning traces (Tyen et al., 2023). Recent methods propose temporal signals for reasoning process error identification and visualization of reasoning paths, while uncertainty analyses highlight the limits of explanation faithfulness (Guo et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025b; Da et al., 2025). We complement these directions with an inference-time instability signal defined directly on token distributions. Figure 2 previews our central observation: instability strength alone "

Analysis of reasoning failures in large language models reveals that instability signals derived from token log probabilities and entropy can predict incorrect answers and distinguish between corrective and destructive instability based on timing of distribution shifts.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning failures in large language models (LLMs) are typically measured only at the end of a generation, yet many failures manifest as a process-level breakdown: the model "loses the thread" mid-reasoning. We study whether such breakdowns are detectable from inference-time observables available in standard APIs (token log probabilities), without any training or fine-tuning. We define a simple instability signal that combines consecutive-step distributional shift (JSD) and uncertainty (entropy), summarize each trace by its peak instability strength, and show that this signal reliably predicts failure. Across GSM8K and HotpotQA, instability strength predicts wrong answers with above-chance AUC and yields monotonic bucket-level accuracy decline at scale across model sizes. Crucially, we show that instability is not uniformly harmful: early instability can reflect subsequent stabilization and a correct final answer (corrective instability), whereas late instability is more often followed by failure (destructive instability), even at comparable peak magnitudes, indicating that recoverability depends not only on how strongly the distribution changes but also on when such changes occur relative to the remaining decoding horizon. The method is model-agnostic, training-free, and reproducible, and is presented as a diagnostic lens rather than a corrective or control mechanism.

Ключевое открытие заключается в том, что нестабильность на ранних этапах генерации (корректирующая нестабильность) часто приводит к правильному ответу, а нестабильность на поздних этапах (деструктивная нестабильность) обычно означает ошибку.

**Justification:**

- **REASONING**: The paper directly addresses reasoning failures in large language models and analyzes how models "lose the thread" during multi-step reasoning processes.

- **INTERPRETABILITY**: The paper analyzes model behavior by examining inference-time observables (token log probabilities, entropy, distributional shifts) to understand and predict when reasoning breaks down, which is core to interpreting model decision-making processes.

- **HALLUCINATIONS**: The paper's focus on detecting and analyzing incorrect answers and reasoning failures relates to understanding when models produce wrong outputs, which is connected to hallucination analysis and mitigation.

It introduces a method that uses token log probabilities and entropy to create instability signals, which can predict when a model is likely to produce incorrect answers. The study finds that the timing of distribution shifts is crucial, as early instability can lead to correct answers while late instability often results in failure.
