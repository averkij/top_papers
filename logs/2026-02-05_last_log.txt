[ 1 9 9 4 0 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r aThe autoregressive video diffusion model has recently gained considerable research interest due to its causal modeling and iterative denoising. In this work, we identify that the multi-head selfattention in these models under-utilizes historical frames: approximately 25% heads attend almost exclusively to the current frame, and discarding their KV caches incurs only minor performance degradation. Building upon this, we propose Dummy Forcing, simple yet effective method to control context accessibility across different heads. Specifically, the proposed heterogeneous memory allocation reduces head-wise context redundancy, accompanied by dynamic head programming to adaptively classify head types. Moreover, we develop context packing technique to achieve more aggressive cache compression. Without additional training, our Dummy Forcing delivers up to 2.0 speedup over the baseline, supporting video generation at 24.3 FPS with less than 0.5% quality drop. Project page is available at https://csguoh.github.io/ project/DummyForcing/. 1. Introduction Video diffusion models (Brooks et al., 2024; Peebles & Xie, 2023; Wan et al., 2025) have achieved remarkable progress in recent years, with the state-of-the-art models now being able to generate realistic shots with complex motions. Early works typically rely on bidirectional attention in diffusion transformers to generate all video frames at once. Under this paradigm, users have to wait until the model processes all frames before they can watch the video, which is slow and prevents interactive generation. Recently, autoregressive video diffusion models (Chen et al., 2024; Yin et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025) have shifted the 1Tsinghua University 2Microsoft Research Asia 3University of Science and Technology of China 4Johns Hopkins University 5ETH Zurich. Work done during Hang Guo and Zhaoyang Jias internship at Microsoft Research Asia. Preprint. January 29, 2026. 1 Figure 1. Weak context utilization in the multi-head attention of existing methods, e.g., Diffusion Forcing (Chen et al., 2024), Self Forcing (Huang et al., 2025). Naively pruning all KV caches of 25% heads results in only marginal performance drop (84.0 vs. 83.78) while speedup inference from 17.6FPS to 19.6FPS. paradigm to frame-by-frame generation, where each autoregressive step iteratively denoises to produce clean frames. Unlike previous bidirectional counterparts, autoregressive video diffusion supports caching mechanism and can aggregate historical context stored in the KV cache through self-attention. By combining the strengths of autoregressive modeling and diffusion denoising, current methods allow sequential frame modeling while maintaining high visual quality. However, existing methods still face efficiency challenges when processing long visual token sequences. For instance, the KV cache length for past frames increases significantly in computation-dense tasks such as long videos or high-resolution videos. Although most current works (Yang et al., 2025a; Liu et al., 2025) improve efficiency at the input level by employing sliding window strategy to restrict the models attention only to recent frames, the models internal utilization on contextual frames still remains black box and has been largely unexplored. To this end, we delve deep into the multi-head self-attention layers of existing models, as they are responsible for context aggregation. Surprisingly, we found most autoregressive video diffusion pipelines (Chen et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025) are inefficient in context utilization: about 25% attention heads disproportionately allocate large attention scores (over 80%) to the current frame, even with access to historical frames (Sec. 3.2 gives detailed discussion). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1, we remove the KV cache corresponding to these heads during inference, and this simple modification causes only 0.26% performance drop. These observations suggest that the pre-trained Efficient Autoregressive Video Diffusion with Dummy Head Figure 2. The proposed Dummy Forcing can be applied to (1) efficiently generate videos, (2) overcome quadratic complexity in high-resolution video generation, and (3) enlarge context lengths without increasing computational overhead. models have learned shortcut to prioritize certain attention heads to perform context aggregation, while leaving the other heads to mainly refine the current frame. Since the latter heads do not actually work on context aggregation, we refer to them as dummy heads in this paper. Based on the above insight, we propose Dummy Forcing to compress redundant contextual information for efficient autoregressive video diffusion models. Specifically, we develop the Heterogeneous Memory Allocation (HMA), which assigns adaptive context lengths based on distinct head types to eliminate redundant historical frames. Subsequently, we introduce Dynamic Head Programming (DHP), which maximizes an information retention objective and uses dynamic programming algorithm to derive optimal head classification results. Finally, we employ Packed Attention Forward (PAF) to achieve more aggressive dummy head numbers through adjust the classification boundary between dummy and non-dummy heads. In short, we make the following key contributions: I. We identify that current autoregressive video diffusion models exhibit inefficient context utilization. Furthermore, we observe dummy heads in these models whose attentions are exclusively focused on the current frame, even though past frames are available. II. We introduce Dummy Forcing to efficiently compress the redundant context of dummy heads. The proposed method enables adaptive cache management and head classification while achieving high compression ratios. III. As shown in Fig. 2, we apply Dummy Forcing to multiple video generation applications. Without any training, the proposed method achieves up to 2.0 end-to-end acceleration compared to the baseline and can generate videos at speeds exceeding 24 FPS. 2. Related Work Video Diffusion Models. Early video diffusion models (Polyak et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023; Brooks et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025a; Zhang & Agrawala, 2025) typically feed all frames into the model at once and employ bidirectional attention during the denoising process.

Autoregressive video diffusion models suffer from inefficient attention mechanisms that underutilize historical frames, but a new method called Dummy Forcing improves efficiency through heterogeneous memory allocation and dynamic head programming while maintaining quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 The autoregressive video diffusion model has recently gained considerable research interest due to its causal modeling and iterative denoising. In this work, we identify that the multi-head self-attention in these models under-utilizes historical frames: approximately 25% heads attend almost exclusively to the current frame, and discarding their KV caches incurs only minor performance degradation. Building upon this, we propose Dummy Forcing, a simple yet effective method to control context accessibility across different heads. Specifically, the proposed heterogeneous memory allocation reduces head-wise context redundancy, accompanied by dynamic head programming to adaptively classify head types. Moreover, we develop a context packing technique to achieve more aggressive cache compression. Without additional training, our Dummy Forcing delivers up to 2.0x speedup over the baseline, supporting video generation at 24.3 FPS with less than 0.5% quality drop. Project page is available at https://csguoh.github.io/project/DummyForcing/.

Техника пакирования контекста позволяет достичь более агрессивного сжатия кэша KV без переобучения модели.

OmniRad is a self-supervised radiological foundation model pretrained on 1.2 million medical images that demonstrates improved performance in classification and segmentation tasks through representation reuse and cross-task transferability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Radiological analysis increasingly benefits from pretrained visual representations that can support heterogeneous downstream tasks across imaging modalities. In this work, we introduce OmniRad, a self-supervised radiological foundation model pretrained on 1.2 million medical images, designed with radiology-inspired principles emphasizing representation reuse and cross-task transferability. We evaluate the pretrained encoder under multiple downstream adaptation regimes, including lightweight task-specific adapters with a frozen backbone as well as full end-to-end fine-tuning for classification, allowing us to assess both representation quality and task-specific performance. OmniRad is evaluated on a broad suite of public benchmarks spanning classification and segmentation across multiple modalities. On the MedMNISTv2 collection, OmniRad improves classification F1 by up to 2.05% over competing foundation models. For dense prediction, OmniRad attains mean Dice score improvements across six MedSegBench datasets when using frozen representations. Qualitative analyses and latent-space visualizations suggest improved feature clustering and modality-related separation.
