Text:"Lin Zheng * 1 Xinyu Li * 1 Qian Liu 2 Xiachong Feng 1 Lingpeng KongModern language models are trained almost exclusively on token sequences produced by fixed tokenizer, an external lossless compressor often over UTF-8 byte sequences, thereby coupling the model to that compressor. This work introduces proxy compression, an alternative training scheme that preserves the efficiency benefits of compressed inputs while providing an end-to-end, raw-byte interface at inference time. During training, one language model is jointly trained on raw byte sequences and compressed views generated by external compressors; through the process, the model learns to internally align compressed sequences and raw bytes. This alignment enables strong transfer between the two formats, even when training predominantly on compressed inputs which are discarded at inference. Extensive experiments on code language modeling demonstrate that proxy compression substantially improves training efficiency and significantly outperforms pure byte-level baselines given fixed compute budgets. As model scale increases, these gains become more pronounced, and proxy-trained models eventually match or rival tokenizer approaches, all while operating solely on raw bytes and retaining the inherent robustness of byte-level modeling.

Introduction Modern language models are almost always trained on compressed views of data rather than on its raw format (Bengio et al., 2003). In practice, the compressor, most commonly tokenizer (Sennrich et al., 2016; Kudo & Richardson, 2018) or arithmetic coding with another language model (Lester et al., 2024), maps the raw input into shorter sequence of discrete tokens that the model actually processes. This *Equal contribution 1University of Hong Kong 2TikTok. Correspondence to: Lin Zheng <lzheng2@cs.hku.hk>. Preprint. February 5, 2026. 1 compression is computationally essential, as it reduces the sequence length and thus enables efficient training. However, this design couples the entire modeling stack to fixed external compressor. Every input and output must pass through it, and at the level of raw data,1 the model is no longer strictly end-to-end, as it learns only to manipulate the compressors outputs. In the case of hand-crafted tokenizers, this coupling introduces well-documented artifacts (Phan et al., 2024), including prompt boundary problems (Microsoft, 2023; Lundberg & Ribeiro, 2023; Athiwaratkun et al., 2024; Hayase et al., 2025), retokenization drift (Team, 2025), under-trained or glitch tokens (Rumbelow & Watkins, 2023; Land & Bartolo, 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Yang, 2024; Yang et al., 2024), data mixture leakage (Hayase et al., 2024), biases against low-resource languages (Petrov et al., 2023; Ahia et al., 2023; Limisiewicz et al., 2024), and increased sensitivity to adversarial inputs (Sun et al., 2020; Pagnoni et al., 2024). In this work, we ask whether it is possible to keep the efficiency benefits of training on compressed data without hard-wiring the compressor into the models interface. We address this with proxy compression (Figure 1): treating external compressors as training-time proxy rather than permanent part of the pipeline. Given training corpus, we apply an external compressor to produce compressed views of each sequence and mix these compressed sequences with raw UTF-8 counterparts during training. single language model is trained to perform next-symbol prediction over both representations jointly. At inference time, we can discard the compressor entirely and run the model on raw bytes alone; the compressor has served only to provide shorter proxy sequences during training for efficiency. Our central finding enabling proxy compression is strong crossrepresentation transfer: although the majority of training data is specified in compressed form for efficiency (e.g., 90%), the model performs surprisingly well on raw-byte inference. Moreover, transfer strength of proxy compression grows with model scale: small models demonstrate weak or negative transfer, while larger models with proxy compression even match or surpass ordinary language models with 1We use raw to refer to the UTF-8 byte encoding of text, contrasting it with compressed sequences often derived from that byte stream, such as tokenized text. Proxy Compression for Language Modeling Figure 1. Overview of proxy compression for language modeling. During training, we prepare mixed-representation inputs by combining compressed sequences with raw UTF-8 bytes, which are packed together to train single language model with next-symbol prediction over both representations. Different representations are associated with special sentinels, such as comp, /comp for compressed data and raw and /raw for raw data. At inference time, the proxy compressor is discarded entirely, and the model operates solely on raw bytes. By training primarily on compressed data (e.g., 90% of training data in this work), this approach captures the training efficiency benefits of compressed data without hard-wiring the compressor into the models interface. hard-wired compressors (Figure 2). Conceptually, proxy compression makes the learning objective more demanding in useful way. The model must predict in two different code spaces and implicitly align them, learning an internal mapping between proxy codes and bytes. This encourages the model to treat compressed sequences as informative hints rather than complete substitute for the raw byte stream. From coding perspective, language model defines compressor via its predictive distribution (Deletang et al., 2024); proxy compression can thus be viewed as partially delegating compression to an external proxy while training the model to remain an effective compressor over raw bytes. This navigates fundamental trade-off: training on purely compressed data is efficient but constrains the model to patterns the compressor exposes, while training with pure raw bytes captures all structure but at high computational cost. Proxy compression gains efficiency from compressed inputs while staying grounded in the underlying byte-level distribution. We instantiate proxy compression with several families of compressors (2): tokenizer-based compression (2.2), which uses conventional tokenizers as proxy compressors; neural proxy compressors (2.3), which combine separately trained byte-level mo"

Proxy compression trains language models on both raw byte sequences and compressed views, enabling efficient training with end-to-end raw-byte inference while maintaining model robustness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Modern language models are trained almost exclusively on token sequences produced by a fixed tokenizer, an external lossless compressor often over UTF-8 byte sequences, thereby coupling the model to that compressor. This work introduces proxy compression, an alternative training scheme that preserves the efficiency benefits of compressed inputs while providing an end-to-end, raw-byte interface at inference time. During training, one language model is jointly trained on raw byte sequences and compressed views generated by external compressors; through the process, the model learns to internally align compressed sequences and raw bytes. This alignment enables strong transfer between the two formats, even when training predominantly on compressed inputs which are discarded at inference. Extensive experiments on code language modeling demonstrate that proxy compression substantially improves training efficiency and significantly outperforms pure byte-level baselines given fixed compute budgets. As model scale increases, these gains become more pronounced, and proxy-trained models eventually match or rival tokenizer approaches, all while operating solely on raw bytes and retaining the inherent robustness of byte-level modeling.

  "desc": "В работе предлагается метод прокси-компрессии для обучения языковых моделей, который использует одновременно сырые байтовые последовательности и сжатые представления данных. Во время обучения модель учится выравнивать между собой оба формата, что позволяет ей эффективнее обучаться на сжатых входах, а при инференсе работать напрямую с байтами. Этот подход сохраняет эффективность, которую дает использование токенизаторов, но избегает зависимости от внешних компрессоров. Экспериментальные результаты показывают, что прокси-компрессия значительно улучшает скорость обучения и превосходит базовые байтовые модели при фиксированном объеме вычислительных ресурсов.",
