Text:"Self-Rewarding Sequential Monte Carlo for Masked Diffusion Language Models Ziwei Luo 1 Ziqi Jin 2 3 Lei Wang 2 Lidong Bing 2 Thomas B. Schon 1 6 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 9 4 8 1 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract This work presents self-rewarding sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), an inference-time scaling algorithm enabling effective sampling of masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). Our algorithm stems from the observation that most existing MDLMs rely on confidence-based sampling strategy, where only tokens with the highest prediction confidence are preserved at each step. This restricts the generation to noise-sensitive, greedy decoding paradigm, resulting in an inevitable collapse in the diversity of possible paths. We address this problem by launching multiple interacting diffusion processes in parallel, referred to as particles, for trajectory exploration. Importantly, we introduce the trajectory-level confidence as self-rewarding signal for assigning particle importance weights. During sampling, particles are iteratively weighted and resampled to systematically steer generation towards globally confident, high-quality samples. Our self-rewarding SMC is verified on various masked diffusion language models and benchmarks, achieving significant improvement without extra training or reward guidance, while effectively converting parallel inference capacity into improved sampling quality. Our code is available at https://github. com/Algolzw/self-rewarding-smc. 1. Introduction Generative modeling with diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020) has led to remarkable advances across wide range of applications, including image generation (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Rombach et al., 2022; Peebles & Xie, 2023), text-to-image generation (Saharia et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023; Gu et al., 2022), and video synthesis (Ho et al., 2022; Blattmann et al., 2023).

LongVPO is a two-stage Direct Preference Optimization framework that enables short-context vision-language models to understand ultra-long videos through synthetic preference triples and recursive captioning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal human annotation.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present LongVPO, a novel two-stage Direct Preference Optimization framework that enables short-context vision-language models to robustly understand ultra-long videos without any long-video annotations. In Stage 1, we synthesize preference triples by anchoring questions to individual short clips, interleaving them with distractors, and applying visual-similarity and question-specificity filtering to mitigate positional bias and ensure unambiguous supervision. We also approximate the reference model's scoring over long contexts by evaluating only the anchor clip, reducing computational overhead. In Stage 2, we employ a recursive captioning pipeline on long videos to generate scene-level metadata, then use a large language model to craft multi-segment reasoning queries and dispreferred responses, aligning the model's preferences through multi-segment reasoning tasks. With only 16K synthetic examples and no costly human labels, LongVPO outperforms the state-of-the-art open-source models on multiple long-video benchmarks, while maintaining strong short-video performance (e.g., on MVBench), offering a scalable paradigm for efficient long-form video understanding.

Self-rewarding sequential Monte Carlo enables effective sampling of masked diffusion language models by using parallel diffusion processes and trajectory-level confidence signals to improve generation quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 This work presents self-rewarding sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), an inference-time scaling algorithm enabling effective sampling of masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). Our algorithm stems from the observation that most existing MDLMs rely on a confidence-based sampling strategy, where only tokens with the highest prediction confidence are preserved at each step. This restricts the generation to a noise-sensitive, greedy decoding paradigm, resulting in an inevitable collapse in the diversity of possible paths. We address this problem by launching multiple interacting diffusion processes in parallel, referred to as particles, for trajectory exploration. Importantly, we introduce the trajectory-level confidence as a self-rewarding signal for assigning particle importance weights. During sampling, particles are iteratively weighted and resampled to systematically steer generation towards globally confident, high-quality samples. Our self-rewarding SMC is verified on various masked diffusion language models and benchmarks, achieving significant improvement without extra training or reward guidance, while effectively converting parallel inference capacity into improved sampling quality. Our code is available at https://github.com/Algolzw/self-rewarding-smc.
