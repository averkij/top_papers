This paper proposes AgentArk, novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights of single model, effectively transforming explicit test-time interactions into implicit model capabilities. This equips single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development. Our code is at https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/AgentArk. Multi-agent Systems (MAS), where multiple models interact through debate (Du et al., 2023; Eo et al., 2025; Hegazy, 2024), critique (Lan et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2025), and consensus (Chen et al., 2024a), have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning tasks (Guo et al., 2024).

[ 1 1 3 0 1 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aLarge language models (LLMs) still produce plausible-sounding but ungrounded factual claims, problem that worsens in multi-turn dialogue as context grows and early errors cascade. We introduce HALLUHARD, challenging multi-turn hallucination benchmark with 950 seed questions spanning four high-stakes domains: legal cases, research questions, medical guidelines, and coding. We operationalize groundedness by requiring inline citations for factual assertions. To support reliable evaluation in open-ended settings, we propose judging pipeline that iteratively retrieves evidence via web search. It can fetch, filter, and parse full-text sources (including PDFs) to assess whether cited material actually supports the generated content. Across diverse set of frontier proprietary and open-weight models, hallucinations remain substantial even with web search ( 30% for the strongest configuration, Opus-4.5 with web search), with content-grounding errors persisting at high rates. Finally, we show that hallucination behavior is shaped by model capacity, turn position, effective reasoning, and the type of knowledge required. https://github.com/epfml/halluhard https://halluhard.com/ 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly expanded the frontier of machine intelligence, for example, reaching goldmedal-level performance on the International Mathematical Olympiad (Huang & Yang, 2025; Deepmind, 2025; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). However, reliability has not kept pace with capability. Even frontier models can produce plausible statements that are not supported by evidence, *Equal contribution 1EPFL 2ELLIS Institute Tubingen 3Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems 4Tubingen AI Center. Correspondence to: Dongyang Fan <dongyang.fan@epfl.ch>, Sebastien Delsad <sebastien.delsad@epfl.ch>. Figure 1. Average hallucination rate on HALLUHARD that contains 950 multi-turn conversations across legal, research, medical, and coding domains. WS denotes web search. Lower values are better. Our challenging benchmark reveals that even frontier LLMs like Opus-4.5 hallucinate in more than 30% of cases with web search and 60% without. failure mode commonly referred to as hallucination. Such errors are difficult for users to detect and can meaningfully erode trust in LLM-assisted workflows. To properly understand and mitigate hallucination, evaluating hallucination is fundamental. Many existing benchmarks saturate quickly as models improve. Yet many existing benchmarks saturate as models improve, in part because they target relatively easy domains or constrained formats such as short-form QA or classification, and because they rely on simplified single-turn prompts that diverge from realworld use. In practice, LLMs operate in multi-turn, openended conversations where context evolves, references accumulate, and early inaccuracies can propagate. To address this gap, we introduce HALLUHARD, new benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in multi-turn interactions and in more challenging task settings. HALLUHARD mirrors real-world, open-ended interactions with LLMs while still supporting verifiable hallucination evaluation. During generation, models are instructed to support factual claims with explicit citations, providing concrete anchor for verification. Our web-search-based judge then follows these citations to retrieve and read the referenced sources in full text, including parsing PDFs when needed. This setup exposes subtle yet common failure mode that is often overlooked: model may cite an appropriate source but still fabricate details that the source does not substantiate, as illustrated in Figure 2. Without reading the full paper, such hallucinations are easy to miss. 1 HALLUHARD: Hard Multi-Turn Hallucination Benchmark may not cleanly measure hallucination propensity. The other category is in-parameter hallucination, which asks whether an LLMs outputs are consistent with information encoded in its parameters. World knowledge is often treated as proxy of in-parameter knowledge gained from web-scale data (Weng, 2024). In-parameter hallucination is commonly evaluated using short-form factual prompts (e.g., QA-style queries) (Lin et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2024a; Agrawal et al., 2024; Pandit et al., 2025), and also via longform generation where responses are broken into atomic facts that can be verified one by one (Min et al., 2023a; Manakul et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2024b). Beyond answerable questions, clean test of in-parameter groundedness is whether models appropriately abstain when asked about non-existent entities or items (Bang et al., 2025; Kirichenko et al., 2025). While the above focus on single-turn setting, few works also involve more challenging multi-turn scenario. Some quantify hallucination by testing whether models can detect hallucinated content in dialogues annotated by humans (Chen et al., 2024; 2025). More recently, KnowMTBench (Anonymous, 2025) evaluates multi-turn responses by checking for contradictions against gold answer or required must-have facts. However, these benchmarks largely avoid open-ended generation for easy hallucination verification, despite this being the dominant way users interact with LLMs today. We address this gap by evaluating hallucinations in open-ended, multi-turn responses in verifiable manner. Evaluating hallucinations makes it possible to systematically characterize how LLMs hallucinate. As evidence accumulates, it becomes possible to develop empirical understanding of recurring hallucinatory patterns. Lin et al. (2024) show that fine-tuning LLMs on human-labeled data can reduce factuality as models encounter with novel knowledge or unfamiliar texts. Song et al. (2025) warn that reinforcement fine-tuning can make LLMs less likely to refuse unanswerable questions. Ravichander et al. (2025) find that larger models generally hallucinate less than smaller ones on response-based tasks, but this advantage does not necessarily extend to refusal-based tasks. Still, because these results reflect only limited set of frontier models and evaluation settings, they do not yet yield comprehensive account of hallucination behavior. Here, we offer more careful and thorough investigation. 3. Why New Benchmark? Unclear definition. We define hallucination purely in terms of groundedness: a"

AgentArk distills multi-agent reasoning dynamics into a single model through hierarchical distillation strategies, enabling efficient yet powerful reasoning capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 While large language model (LLM) multi-agent systems achieve superior reasoning performance through iterative debate, practical deployment is limited by their high computational cost and error propagation. This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights of a single model, effectively transforming explicit test-time interactions into implicit model capabilities. This equips a single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development. Our code is at https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/AgentArk.

Авторы предлагают три подхода: улучшенное fine-tuning с рассуждениями, аугментацию на основе траекторий и дистилляцию с учётом процесса. Дистиллированные модели сохраняют вычислительную эффективность одного агента, но демонстрируют способности к рассуждению и самокоррекции, присущие многоагентным системам.

"AgentArk distills multi-agent reasoning dynamics into a single model through hierarchical distillation strategies, enabling efficient yet powerful reasoning capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 While large language model (LLM) multi-agent systems achieve superior reasoning performance through iterative debate, practical deployment is limited by their high computational cost and error propagation. This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights of a single model, effectively transforming explicit test-time interactions into implicit model capabilities. This equips a single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development.

Large language models continue to generate plausible but ungrounded factual claims in multi-turn dialogue, with hallucinations remaining significant even when utilizing web search for verification across high-stakes domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) still produce plausible-sounding but ungrounded factual claims, a problem that worsens in multi-turn dialogue as context grows and early errors cascade. We introduce HalluHard, a challenging multi-turn hallucination benchmark with 950 seed questions spanning four high-stakes domains: legal cases, research questions, medical guidelines, and coding. We operationalize groundedness by requiring inline citations for factual assertions. To support reliable evaluation in open-ended settings, we propose a judging pipeline that iteratively retrieves evidence via web search. It can fetch, filter, and parse full-text sources (including PDFs) to assess whether cited material actually supports the generated content. Across a diverse set of frontier proprietary and open-weight models, hallucinations remain substantial even with web search (approx 30% for the strongest configuration, Opus-4.5 with web search), with content-grounding errors persisting at high rates. Finally, we show that hallucination behavior is shaped by model capacity, turn position, effective reasoning, and the type of knowledge required.
