Text:"D-CORE: Incentivizing Task Decomposition in Large Reasoning Models for Complex Tool Use Bowen Xu * 1 Shaoyu Wu * 1 Hao Jiang 1 Kai Liu 1 Xin Chen 1 Lulu Hu 1 Bin Yang 1 6 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 0 6 1 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aEffective tool use and reasoning are essential capabilities for large reasoning models (LRMs) to address complex real-world problems. Through empirical analysis, we identify that current LRMs lack the capability of sub-task decomposition in complex tool use scenarios, leading to Lazy Reasoning. To address this, we propose two-stage training framework D-CORE (Decomposing tasks and Composing Reasoning processes) that first incentivize the LRMs task decomposition reasoning capability via self-distillation, followed by diversity-aware reinforcement learning (RL) to restore LRMs reflective reasoning capability. D-CORE achieves robust tool-use improvements across diverse benchmarks and model scales. Experiments on BFCLv3 demonstrate superiority of our method: D-CORE-8B reaches 77.7% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing 8B model by 5.7%. Meanwhile, D-CORE-14B establishes new state-of-the-art at 79.3%, outperforming 70B models despite being 5 smaller. The source code is available at https://github.com/ alibaba/EfficientAI. 1. Introduction Tool use equips Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ability to invoke external interfaces, serving as cornerstone for autonomous agents (Jimenez et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2023). As tasks evolve from simple queries to compositional workflows (Qiao et al., 2024; Shen et al., 2024), recent benchmarks underscore the necessity for robust reasoning in real-world scenarios (Yao et al., 2024; Patil et al.). However, current paradigms face dichotomy. Conventional tool use LLM approaches dominated by rule-based SFT (Liu et al., 2024b;a; Zhong et al., 2025; Prabhakar et al., 2025; Yin et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2023), suffering from poor generalization in complex scenar- *Equal contribution 1Alibaba Cloud Computing, Alibaba Group.

Conversely, while the RL-enhanced LRMs demonstrates success in math (Guo et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025; Anthropic, 2025; OpenAI, 2024b; 2025) and single-turn tool use tasks (Qian et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025), we observe diminishing return in complex tool use scenarios: LRMs consume substantiallly more tokens for reasoning yet yield marginal performance gains over LLMs. This points to fundamental challenge: how to effectively translate reasoning computation into complex tool proficiency for LRMs. We investigate Qwen3-series LRMs (Yang et al., 2025) and observe critical issue: while effective in single-turn tool use scenarios, they suffer form Lazy Reasoning in complex multi-turn contexts. The models generate extensive but meaningless reasoning processes, impeding RL optimization (Yue et al., 2025; Gandhi et al., 2025; Ning et al., 2025). We attribute this degradation to the lack of task decomposition, verified by the effectiveness of decomposition-based prompting (Khot et al., 2022b; Zhou et al., 2022). Motivated by this, we propose D-CORE (Decomposing tasks and Composing Reasoning processes). This framework explicitly enforces decomposition and diversity via self-distillation and diversity-aware GRPO (DA-GRPO). As shown in Figure 1, D-CORE converts inefficient reasoning cycles into effective, step-by-step processes. We first employ self-distillation to bootstrap task decomposition, organizing sub-task executions into trajectories. However, this D-CORE: Incentivizing Task Decomposition in Large Reasoning Models for Complex Tool Use Figure 2. Comparison of LRM Qwen3 vs. instruct LLM xLAM2 performance on BFCLv3 Parallel, Irrelevance , Multi-turn and τ -bench task. supervised approach tends to homogenize reasoning and reduce reflection. We remedy this via DA-GRPO, which adds an entropy regularization term to the advantage function. This design balances structural decomposition with reasoning diversity, enabling the LRM to autonomously decompose tasks and execute tools. Our main contributions are: We identify that LRMs lack the capability of sub-task decomposition in complex tool-use scenarios, leading to the phenomenon of Lazy Reasoning. We develop self-distillation framework that integrates task decomposition with reasoning process composition, enabling LRMs to acquire sophisticated sequential tool use strategies during reasoning without requiring additional human annotation. We propose DA-GRPO that incorporates entropy-based advantage functions to enable self-distillation LRMs to restore their reflection capabilities while maintaining task decomposition abilities, thereby addressing more complex tool use scenarios. 2. Tool Use Reasoning: Patterns and2.1. Preliminary Tool use tasks. Tool use tasks can be categorized into single-turn and multi-turn tasks based on context dependency. Single-turn tasks can be formulated as Markov decision process (P, T, Q) τ , where denotes the system policy, represents the available tool set, corresponds to the current query, and τ represents tool call results. Upon decomposing query into subtasks = {s1, s2, . . . , sn}, three key scenarios for arise: Sequential: si depends on output of si1, Parallel: si can execute parrallely, Irrelevant: requires no tool use. The primary challenge lies in the fact that multi-intent and tool irrelevance make particularly challenging for tool use LLMs (Liu et al., 2024a; Lin et al., 2024). Furthermore, multi-turn tool use scenarios (Yao et al., 2024; Patil et al.; Prabhakar et al., 2025) can be formulated as (P, T, C, Q) τ , where denotes the conversation history. Unlike single-turn tasks, this formulation introduces additional complexity by requiring consideration of both the current query intent and the long-term intent embedded in C. Reasoning process. reasoning process refers to the sequence of intermediate steps through which LRM arrives at its final answer. Within the LRM outputs examined in this paper, reasoning processes are specifically delimited by <think> and </think> tags. We controlled LRMs reasonin"

Machine translation experiments for Turkic languages using nllb-200, LoRA fine-tuning, and prompt-based approaches achieved varying chrF++ scores across language pairs.  					AI-generated summary 				 We explore machine translation for five Turkic language pairs: Russian-Bashkir, Russian-Kazakh, Russian-Kyrgyz, English-Tatar, English-Chuvash. Fine-tuning nllb-200-distilled-600M with LoRA on synthetic data achieved chrF++ 49.71 for Kazakh and 46.94 for Bashkir. Prompting DeepSeek-V3.2 with retrieved similar examples achieved chrF++ 39.47 for Chuvash. For Tatar, zero-shot or retrieval-based approaches achieved chrF++ 41.6, while for Kyrgyz the zero-shot approach reached 45.6. We release the dataset and the obtained weights.

Лучшие результаты показала тонкая настройка, достигнув метрики chrF++ 49.71 для казахского языка, а prompt-based подход продемонстрировал эффективность при использовании примеров для низкоресурсных языков.
