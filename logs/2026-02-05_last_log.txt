Text:"WIDESEEK-R1: Exploring Width Scaling for Broad Information Seeking via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Zelai Xu 1 * Zhexuan Xu 1 * Ruize Zhang 2 * Chunyang Zhu 3 Shi Yu 4 Weilin Liu 3 Quanlu Zhang 3 Wenbo Ding 2 Chao Yu 2 Yu Wang 1 (cid:128) Project Page Code ı Dataset 6 2 0 2 4 ] . [ 1 4 3 6 4 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on depth scaling, where single agent solves long-horizon problems with multi-turn reasoning and tool use. However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WIDESEEK-R1, lead-agentsubagent framework trained via multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WIDESEEK-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on curated dataset of 20k broad informationseeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WIDESEEK-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WIDESEEKR1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling. 1.

[ 1 3 7 9 3 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Fig. 1. We present VisionLanguage Steering (VLS), training-free framework for inference-time steering of frozen generative robot policies. Our core idea is to leverage the open-world understanding capabilities of VLMs to generate reward functions for partially denoised action proposals, helping the base policy successfully operate in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios such as object changes, scene changes or instruction changes by correcting the denoising path. VLS demonstrates excellent performance in simulation benchmarks as well as real-world experiments, proving its effectiveness. AbstractWhy do pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policies fail when the same task is performed near an obstacle, on shifted support surface, or amid mild clutter? Such failures rarely reflect missing motor skills; instead, they expose limitation of imitation learning under traintest shifts, where action generation is tightly coupled to training-specific spatial configurations and task specifications. Retraining or fine-tuning to address these failures is costly and conceptually misaligned, as the required behaviors already exist but cannot be selectively adapted at test time. We propose VisionLanguage Steering (VLS), trainingfree framework for inference-time adaptation of frozen generative robot policies. VLS treats adaptation as an inference-time control problem, steering the sampling process of pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policy in response to out-of-distribution observationlanguage inputs without modifying policy parameters.

Text:"Horizon-LM: RAM-Centric Architecture for LLM Training Single-GPU Training of Hundreds-of-Billions Parameter Language Models with Mixed BF16/FP32 Precision Code: https://github.com/DLYuanGod/Horizon-LM Zhengqing Yuan1 Lichao Sun2 Yanfang (Fanny) Ye1 1University of Notre Dame 2Lehigh University 6 2 0 2 4 ] . [ 1 6 1 8 4 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the evolution of single-GPU hardware, making model scale increasingly constrained by memory capacity rather than computation. While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multiGPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for largemodel optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint. On single H200 GPU with 1.5 TB host RAM, Horizon-LM reliably trains models up to 120B parameters. On standard single A100 machine, Horizon-LM achieves up to 12.2 higher training throughput than DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 with CPU offloading while preserving numerical correctness. Across platforms and scales, Horizon-LM sustains high device uti"

Text:"ERNIE 5.0 Technical Report ERNIE Team, Baidu ernie@baidu.com Abstract In this report, we introduce ERNIE 5.0, natively autoregressive foundation model desinged for unified multimodal understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under unified next-groupof-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts novel elastic training paradigm. Within single pre-training run, the model learns family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memoryor time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation. To facilitate further research, we present detailed visualizations of modality-agnostic expert routing in the unified model, alongside comprehensive empirical analysis of elastic training, aiming to offer profound insights to the community.

This comes with two potential limitations: the need to design the reward, and the potentially sparse nature of binary rewards. Here, we systematically investigate rewards derived from the probability or log-probability of emitting the reference answer (or any other prompt continuation present in the data), which have the advantage of not relying on specific verifiers and being available at scale. Several recent works have advocated for the use of similar rewards (e.g., VeriFree, JEPO, RLPR, NOVER). We systematically compare variants of likelihood-based rewards with standard baselines, testing performance both on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and on long-form answers where no external verifier is available. We find that using the log-probability of the reference answer as the reward for chain-of-thought (CoT) learning is the only option that performs well in all setups. This reward is also consistent with the next-token log-likelihood loss used during pretraining. In verifiable settings, log-probability rewards bring comparable or better success rates than reinforcing with standard binary rewards, and yield much better perplexity. In non-verifiable settings, they perform on par with SFT. On the other hand, methods based on probability, such as VeriFree, flatline on non-verifiable settings due to vanishing probabilities of getting the correct answer. Overall, this establishes log-probability rewards as viable method for CoT fine-tuning, bridging the short, verifiable and long, non-verifiable answe"

[ 1 4 0 8 4 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aOmni-modal Large Language Models (OmniLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omnimodal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for OmniLLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts twostage compression strategy: (i) spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks. *Equal contribution 1New Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) 2Kling Team, Kuaishou Technology 3Nanjing University 4The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) 5Sichuan University 6Peking University. Correspondence to: Qiang Liu <qiang.liu@nlpr.ia.ac.cn>. Preprint. February 5, 2026. 1 Figure 1. Performance comparison across five audiovideo benchmarks. Results are obtained using Qwen2.5-Omni-7B with 35% token retained ratio, comparing OmniSIFT against three baseline token compression methods and the full-token baseline. 1. Introduction The rapid evolution of Omni-LLMs (Cheng et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2025b; Liu et al., 2025a) has significantly advanced holistic audio-video-language understanding (Hong et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025). However, video signals are composed of densely sampled consecutive frames (Chen et al., 2024b; Jiang et al., 2025a), and audio streams must be encoded at high temporal resolution to capture acoustic dynamics (Ji et al., 2024). When these high-resolution streams are tokenized and interleaved for joint reasoning, the resulting sequence length grows rapidly. For example, typical 20-second multimodal clip can yield more than 20K tokens (Xu et al., 2025a). Such long token sequences significantly increase computational cost, particularly for long video understanding (Fu et al., 2025). Token compression (Chen et al., 2024a; Liu et al., 2025d;b; Ye et al., 2025) has emerged as practical solution to mitigate the prohibitive computational cost caused by excessive token sequences. In the context of vision-centric MLLMs, OmniSIFT: Modality-Asymmetric Token Compression for Efficient Omni-modal Large Language Models be resolved using visual cues alone, whereas the saliency of audio signals depends on whether the visual scene provides semantic anchor (Zhao et al., 2018; Arandjelovic & Zisserman, 2017), such as visible speaker or visually grounded event (Chowdhury et al., 2025). This perceptual asymmetry suggests that effective omni-modal token compression should be guided by visual semantics rather than treated symmetrically across modalities. Taken together, these observations suggest three design principles for Omni-LLM token compression: (1) Modalityasymmetric, vision-guided compression; (2) Lightweight compression; (3) Compatibility with efficient operators. Based on the above analysis, we present OmniSIFT (Omnimodal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), modality-asymmetric framework for visually guided token compression. As illustrated in Figure 2, OmniSIFT first prunes spatial and temporal redundancy in video to produce compact set of visual anchors, and then uses these anchors to select the audio tokens that are most informative for the scene. This two-stage pipeline removes uninformative signals while preserving the key multimodal cues required for reasoning. With only 4.85M additional parameters, OmniSIFT achieves lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip on Qwen2.5-Omni-7B. Moreover, with only 25% of the original tokens retained, it consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the full-token model on several settings, as illustrated in Figure 1. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: Based on the asymmetric dependency between audio and video, we derive practical design principles for omni-modal token compression. We present OmniSIFT, modality-asymmetric framework that first removes spatial and temporal redundancy in video tokens and then uses the resulting visual anchors to select informative audio tokens. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks show that OmniSIFT delivers strong performanceefficiency gains, achieving higher accuracy even with only 25% of the original tokens. 2. Related Works 2.1. Omni-modal Large Language Models Omni-LLMs (Jiang et al., 2025b) extend large language models to process heterogeneous modalities within unified autoregressive framework. Unlike conventional VideoLLMs (An et al., 2025; Bai et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025a; Figure 2. Compression paradigm comparison for Omni-LLMs. Token compression for Omni-LLMs can be categorized into three paradigms: (a) modality-decoupled compression (left top), which applies audio and video compression independently; (b) modalitysymmetric compression (right top), which treats the two modalities equally informative; and (c) modality-asymmetric compression (bottom, ours), which first prunes visual redundancy and then performs visually guided audio compression. substantial body of work has explored effective strategies for pruning redundant visual tokens (Chen et al., 2024a; Tao et al., 2025a; Yao et al., 2025), demonstrating that significant efficiency gains can be achieved with minimal performance degradation.

Hybrid Sparse Attention architecture interleaves full and sparse attention layers, using full attention output to guide sparse layer token selection and cache reuse for improved efficiency and performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 This work introduces Hybrid Sparse Attention (HySparse), a new architecture that interleaves each full attention layer with several sparse attention layers. While conceptually simple, HySparse strategically derives each sparse layer's token selection and KV caches directly from the preceding full attention layer. This architecture resolves two fundamental limitations of prior sparse attention methods. First, conventional approaches typically rely on additional proxies to predict token importance, introducing extra complexity and potentially suboptimal performance. In contrast, HySparse uses the full attention layer as a precise oracle to identify important tokens. Second, existing sparse attention designs often reduce computation without saving KV cache. HySparse enables sparse attention layers to reuse the full attention KV cache, thereby reducing both computation and memory. We evaluate HySparse on both 7B dense and 80B MoE models. Across all settings, HySparse consistently outperforms both full attention and hybrid SWA baselines. Notably, in the 80B MoE model with 49 total layers, only 5 layers employ full attention, yet HySparse achieves substantial performance gains while reducing KV cache storage by nearly 10x.

Архитектура одновременно снижает как вычислительные затраты, так и требования к памяти для хранения KV-кешей.

Multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning enable parallel information seeking with scalable orchestration, achieving performance comparable to larger single agents.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on depth scaling, where a single agent solves long-horizon problems with multi-turn reasoning and tool use. However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.

Data2Behavior predicts unintended model behaviors before training using MDF, a lightweight method that analyzes data features to reveal potential biases without parameter updates.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire unintended biases from seemingly benign training data even without explicit cues or malicious content. Existing methods struggle to detect such risks before fine-tuning, making post hoc evaluation costly and inefficient. To address this challenge, we introduce Data2Behavior, a new task for predicting unintended model behaviors prior to training. We also propose Manipulating Data Features (MDF), a lightweight approach that summarizes candidate data through their mean representations and injects them into the forward pass of a base model, allowing latent statistical signals in the data to shape model activations and reveal potential biases and safety risks without updating any parameters. MDF achieves reliable prediction while consuming only about 20% of the GPU resources required for fine-tuning. Experiments on Qwen3-14B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12b-it confirm that MDF can anticipate unintended behaviors and provide insight into pre-training vulnerabilities.

Pretrained diffusion and flow-matching policies fail under test-time shifts due to tight coupling with training configurations, prompting the development of Vision-Language Steering (VLS) for training-free inference-time adaptation through vision-language model-guided trajectory steering.  					AI-generated summary 				 Why do pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policies fail when the same task is performed near an obstacle, on a shifted support surface, or amid mild clutter? Such failures rarely reflect missing motor skills; instead, they expose a limitation of imitation learning under train-test shifts, where action generation is tightly coupled to training-specific spatial configurations and task specifications. Retraining or fine-tuning to address these failures is costly and conceptually misaligned, as the required behaviors already exist but cannot be selectively adapted at test time. We propose Vision-Language Steering (VLS), a training-free framework for inference-time adaptation of frozen generative robot policies. VLS treats adaptation as an inference-time control problem, steering the sampling process of a pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policy in response to out-of-distribution observation-language inputs without modifying policy parameters. By leveraging vision-language models to synthesize trajectory-differentiable reward functions, VLS guides denoising toward action trajectories that satisfy test-time spatial and task requirements. Across simulation and real-world evaluations, VLS consistently outperforms prior steering methods, achieving a 31% improvement on CALVIN and a 13% gain on LIBERO-PRO. Real-world deployment on a Franka robot further demonstrates robust inference-time adaptation under test-time spatial and semantic shifts.

Horizon-LM enables large-model training on single GPUs by redefining CPU-GPU roles and eliminating persistent GPU memory usage through explicit recomputation and pipelined execution.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the evolution of single-GPU hardware, making model scale increasingly constrained by memory capacity rather than computation. While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain a GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As a result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multi-GPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, a memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for large-model optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through a CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing a pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint. On a single H200 GPU with 1.5\,TB host RAM, Horizon-LM reliably trains models up to 120B parameters. On a standard single A100 machine, Horizon-LM achieves up to 12.2times higher training throughput than DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 with CPU offloading while preserving numerical correctness. Across platforms and scales, Horizon-LM sustains high device utilization and predictable memory growth, demonstrating that host memory, not GPU memory, defines the true feasibility boundary for node-scale large-model training.

"Horizon-LM enables large-model training on single GPUs by redefining CPU-GPU roles and eliminating persistent GPU memory usage through explicit recomputation and pipelined execution.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the evolution of single-GPU hardware, making model scale increasingly constrained by memory capacity rather than computation. While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain a GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As a result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multi-GPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, a memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for large-model optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through a CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing a pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint. On a single H200 GPU with 1.5\,TB host RAM, Horizon-LM reliably trains models up to 120B parameters. On a standard single A100 machine, Horizon-LM achieves up to 12.2times higher training throughput than DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 with CPU offloading while preserving numerical correctness. Across platforms and scales, Horizon-LM sustains high device utilization and predictable memory growth, demonstrating that host memory, not GPU memory, defines the true feasibility boundary for node-scale large-model training."

ERNIE 5.0 is a production-scale trillion-parameter autoregressive model that unifies multimodal understanding and generation through sparse MoE architecture and elastic training.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this report, we introduce ERNIE 5.0, a natively autoregressive foundation model desinged for unified multimodal understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation. To facilitate further research, we present detailed visualizations of modality-agnostic expert routing in the unified model, alongside comprehensive empirical analysis of elastic training, aiming to offer profound insights to the community.

Unified multimodal models exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and generation capabilities, indicating only surface-level integration rather than deep cognitive convergence.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMM) have demonstrated remarkable progress in both understanding and generation tasks. However, whether these two capabilities are genuinely aligned and integrated within a single model remains unclear. To investigate this question, we introduce GapEval, a bidirectional benchmark designed to quantify the gap between understanding and generation capabilities, and quantitatively measure the cognitive coherence of the two "unified" directions. Each question can be answered in both modalities (image and text), enabling a symmetric evaluation of a model's bidirectional inference capability and cross-modal consistency. Experiments reveal a persistent gap between the two directions across a wide range of UMMs with different architectures, suggesting that current models achieve only surface-level unification rather than deep cognitive convergence of the two. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we conduct an empirical study from the perspective of knowledge manipulation to illustrate the underlying limitations. Our findings indicate that knowledge within UMMs often remains disjoint. The capability emergence and knowledge across modalities are unsynchronized, paving the way for further exploration.

"Unified multimodal models exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and generation capabilities, indicating only surface-level integration rather than deep cognitive convergence.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMM) have demonstrated remarkable progress in both understanding and generation tasks. However, whether these two capabilities are genuinely aligned and integrated within a single model remains unclear. To investigate this question, we introduce GapEval, a bidirectional benchmark designed to quantify the gap between understanding and generation capabilities, and quantitatively measure the cognitive coherence of the two "unified" directions. Each question can be answered in both modalities (image and text), enabling a symmetric evaluation of a model's bidirectional inference capability and cross-modal consistency. Experiments reveal a persistent gap between the two directions across a wide range of UMMs with different architectures, suggesting that current models achieve only surface-level unification rather than deep cognitive convergence of the two. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we conduct an empirical study from the perspective of knowledge manipulation to illustrate the underlying limitations. Our findings indicate that knowledge within UMMs often remains disjoint. The capability emergence and knowledge across modalities are unsynchronized, paving the way for further exploration."

**Reasoning:** The paper introduces GapEval, a benchmark designed to analyze and quantify the gap between understanding and generation capabilities in multimodal models. It investigates model behavior, cognitive coherence, and underlying mechanisms through empirical analysis. This directly relates to INTERPRETABILITY as it focuses on analyzing model behavior and providing explanations for why models exhibit certain characteristics (surface-level unification vs. deep cognitive convergence).

Log-probability rewards derived from the reference answer's likelihood outperform binary rewards in chain-of-thought fine-tuning across both verifiable and non-verifiable reasoning benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on reasoning benchmarks via reinforcement learning requires a specific reward function, often binary, for each benchmark. This comes with two potential limitations: the need to design the reward, and the potentially sparse nature of binary rewards. Here, we systematically investigate rewards derived from the probability or log-probability of emitting the reference answer (or any other prompt continuation present in the data), which have the advantage of not relying on specific verifiers and being available at scale. Several recent works have advocated for the use of similar rewards (e.g., VeriFree, JEPO, RLPR, NOVER). We systematically compare variants of likelihood-based rewards with standard baselines, testing performance both on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and on long-form answers where no external verifier is available. We find that using the log-probability of the reference answer as the reward for chain-of-thought (CoT) learning is the only option that performs well in all setups. This reward is also consistent with the next-token log-likelihood loss used during pretraining. In verifiable settings, log-probability rewards bring comparable or better success rates than reinforcing with standard binary rewards, and yield much better perplexity. In non-verifiable settings, they perform on par with SFT. On the other hand, methods based on probability, such as VeriFree, flatline on non-verifiable settings due to vanishing probabilities of getting the correct answer. Overall, this establishes log-probability rewards as a viable method for CoT fine-tuning, bridging the short, verifiable and long, non-verifiable answer settings.

PAR is a multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation that uses hierarchical structure modeling, autoregressive transformers, and flow-based decoding to produce high-quality protein structures with improved generalization and reduced exposure bias.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present protein autoregressive modeling (PAR), the first multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation via coarse-to-fine next-scale prediction. Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation. Notably, PAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, supporting flexible human-prompted conditional generation and motif scaffolding without requiring fine-tuning. On the unconditional generation benchmark, PAR effectively learns protein distributions and produces backbones of high design quality, and exhibits favorable scaling behavior. Together, these properties establish PAR as a promising framework for protein structure generation.

Generative 3D models face challenges in animation rigging, which this work addresses by introducing SkinTokens—a learned discrete representation for skinning weights—and TokenRig, a unified autoregressive framework that models skeletons and skin deformations together, improving rigging accuracy through reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid proliferation of generative 3D models has created a critical bottleneck in animation pipelines: rigging. Existing automated methods are fundamentally limited by their approach to skinning, treating it as an ill-posed, high-dimensional regression task that is inefficient to optimize and is typically decoupled from skeleton generation. We posit this is a representation problem and introduce SkinTokens: a learned, compact, and discrete representation for skinning weights. By leveraging an FSQ-CVAE to capture the intrinsic sparsity of skinning, we reframe the task from continuous regression to a more tractable token sequence prediction problem. This representation enables TokenRig, a unified autoregressive framework that models the entire rig as a single sequence of skeletal parameters and SkinTokens, learning the complicated dependencies between skeletons and skin deformations. The unified model is then amenable to a reinforcement learning stage, where tailored geometric and semantic rewards improve generalization to complex, out-of-distribution assets. Quantitatively, the SkinTokens representation leads to a 98%-133% percents improvement in skinning accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, while the full TokenRig framework, refined with RL, enhances bone prediction by 17%-22%. Our work presents a unified, generative approach to rigging that yields higher fidelity and robustness, offering a scalable solution to a long-standing challenge in 3D content creation.

OmniSIFT is a modality-asymmetric token compression framework for Omni-LLMs that reduces computational overhead through spatio-temporal video pruning and vision-guided audio selection while maintaining superior performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Omni-modal Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.

HY3D-Bench presents an open-source ecosystem for 3D content creation that provides high-fidelity 3D objects and synthetic assets to advance 3D generation capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 While recent advances in neural representations and generative models have revolutionized 3D content creation, the field remains constrained by significant data processing bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce HY3D-Bench, an open-source ecosystem designed to establish a unified, high-quality foundation for 3D generation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We curate a library of 250k high-fidelity 3D objects distilled from large-scale repositories, employing a rigorous pipeline to deliver training-ready artifacts, including watertight meshes and multi-view renderings; (2) We introduce structured part-level decomposition, providing the granularity essential for fine-grained perception and controllable editing; and (3) We bridge real-world distribution gaps via a scalable AIGC synthesis pipeline, contributing 125k synthetic assets to enhance diversity in long-tail categories. Validated empirically through the training of Hunyuan3D-2.1-Small, HY3D-Bench democratizes access to robust data resources, aiming to catalyze innovation across 3D perception, robotics, and digital content creation.

"HY3D-Bench presents an open-source ecosystem for 3D content creation that provides high-fidelity 3D objects and synthetic assets to advance 3D generation capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 While recent advances in neural representations and generative models have revolutionized 3D content creation, the field remains constrained by significant data processing bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce HY3D-Bench, an open-source ecosystem designed to establish a unified, high-quality foundation for 3D generation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We curate a library of 250k high-fidelity 3D objects distilled from large-scale repositories, employing a rigorous pipeline to deliver training-ready artifacts, including watertight meshes and multi-view renderings; (2) We introduce structured part-level decomposition, providing the granularity essential for fine-grained perception and controllable editing; and (3) We bridge real-world distribution gaps via a scalable AIGC synthesis pipeline, contributing 125k synthetic assets to enhance diversity in long-tail categories. Validated empirically through the training of Hunyuan3D-2.1-Small, HY3D-Bench democratizes access to robust data resources, aiming to catalyze innovation across 3D perception, robotics, and digital content creation."

Test-Time Improvement (TTI) in autonomous LLM agents involves iterative environmental interaction that enhances performance, but current evaluation methods inadequately capture task optimization efficiency and memory utilization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in autonomous LLM agents demonstrate their ability to improve performance through iterative interaction with the environment. We define this paradigm as Test-Time Improvement (TTI). However, the mechanisms under how and why TTI succeed or fail remain poorly understood, and existing evaluation metrics fail to capture their task optimization efficiency, behavior adaptation after erroneous actions, and the specific utility of working memory for task completion. To address these gaps, we propose Test-time Improvement Diagnostic Evaluation (TIDE), an agent-agnostic and environment-agnostic framework that decomposes TTI into three comprehensive and interconnected dimensions. The framework measures (1) the overall temporal dynamics of task completion and (2) identifies whether performance is primarily constrained by recursive looping behaviors or (3) by burdensome accumulated memory. Through extensive experiments across diverse agents and environments, TIDE highlights that improving agent performance requires more than scaling internal reasoning, calling for explicitly optimizing the interaction dynamics between the agent and the environment.

Авторы предлагают TIDE — новую оценочную метрику, которая разбирает TTI на три ключевых измерения: временную динамику выполнения задач, циклические поведения и использование рабочей памяти. Фреймворк показывает, что текущие методы оценки неадекватно отражают эффективность оптимизации и утилизацию памяти. Исследование демонстрирует, что улучшение производительности агента требует не только масштабирования внутренних вычислений, но и оптимизации взаимодействия между агентом и окружением.",
