Text:"Reward-free Alignment for Conflicting Objectives Peter Chen 1 Xiaopeng Li 2 Xi Chen 3 Tianyi LinDirect alignment methods are increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, many real-world alignment problems involve multiple conflicting objectives, where naive aggregation of preferences can lead to unstable training and poor trade-offs. In particular, weighted loss methods may fail to identify update directions that simultaneously improve all objectives, and existing multi-objective approaches often rely on explicit reward models, introducing additional complexity and distorting user-specified preferences. Our first contribution is to propose Reward-free Alignment framework for Conflicted Objectives (RACO) that directly leverages pairwise preference data and resolves gradient conflicts via novel clipped variant of conflict-averse gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees to Pareto-critical points that respect user-specified objective weights, and show that clipping can strictly improve convergence rate in two-objective cases. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct experiments to demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed framework for LLM alignment. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on multiobjective summarization and safety alignment tasks across multiple LLM families (Qwen 3, Llama 3, Gemma 3) show that our method consistently achieves better Pareto trade-offs compared to existing multi-objective alignment baselines.

Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have become core component of modern generative AI systems, with widespread applications across research, industry, and public policy. Recent advances have demonstrated strong capabilities in 1Columbia University 2CUHK SZ 3NYU Stern. Correspondence to: Tianyi Lin <tl3335@columbia.edu>. Preprint. February 3, 2026. language understanding and generation tasks such as retrieval, reasoning, and long-form analysis (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Bubeck et al., 2023). Deploying these models in real-world settings, however, requires careful alignment with human preferences to ensure that their outputs are reliable, helpful, and safe (Bai et al., 2022a). widely adopted approach to alignment is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020), which models human judgments via an intermediate reward function and then optimizes the policy using RL. While RLHF has proven effective in practice (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023), it relies on multi-stage pipeline involving reward modeling and policy optimization, making it computationally demanding and sensitive to modeling choices. To reduce this complexity, recent work has explored rewardfree alignment methods that operate directly on preference data. Direct preference optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) and its variants (Azar et al., 2024; Ethayarajh et al., 2024; Park et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024; Meng et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025a) recast alignment as an offline optimization problem over preference pairs, eliminating the need for explicit reward modeling while retaining strong empirical performance. Despite their simplicity and success, most existing direct alignment methods are inherently single-objective. In contrast, human-aligned artificial intelligence is fundamentally multi-objective problem (Vamplew et al., 2018). In practice, users and developers simultaneously care about multiple, often conflicting criteriasuch as helpfulness, harmlessness, faithfulness, and conciseness. These objectives are heterogeneous and frequently competing, so optimizing single scalar objective or naively aggregating preferences can lead to unstable training dynamics and poor trade-offs (Barrett & Narayanan, 2008; Van Moffaert & Nowe, 2014; Hayes et al., 2022; Rame et al., 2023). This tension is evident in real deployments: OpenAI reports an alignment tax, where improvements in certain desired behaviors degrade performance on others (Ouyang et al., 2022). Similarly, jailbreak studies show that models trained to be harmless can still be induced to comply with unsafe requests, highlighting unresolved conflicts between being helpful and being safe (Wei et al., 2023). These challenges Reward-free Alignment for Conflicting Objectives have motivated growing body of work on multi-objective alignment. Existing approaches include combining multiple trained models (Rame et al., 2023; Jang et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024), training steerable policies conditioned on objective weights or preferences (Wang et al., 2024a;b; Yang et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2024), and steering behavior at inference time via modified decoding (Shi et al., 2024). Despite their differences, these methods rely on linear aggregation and/or explicit reward modeling, and do not directly address the difficulty posed by conflicting objectives. key limitation of linear aggregation is that it is ill-suited to optimization problems with conflicting gradients. As shown in the literature, when objectives induce opposing gradient directions, there may exist no update direction that simultaneously improves all objectives (Sener & Koltun, 2018). Consequently, weighted loss formulations necessarily privilege certain objectives at the expense of others, even under careful tuning. This issue is pronounced in preference alignment, where objectives such as helpfulness and harmlessness are often anti-correlated and supported by disjoint or noisy preference data. For example, Zhou et al. (2024) incorporate multiple objectives through weighted margin terms, but require training separate reward models for different weight configurations and remain sensitive to gradient conflicts. Adaptive reweighting methods (Liu et al., 2025) partially alleviate imbalance, yet their objectives remain weighted combinations of losses and therefore inherit the same structural limitations. These observations motivate reward-free alignment methods that account for conflicting objective, rather than relying solely on linear aggregation. We adopt different perspective and view preference alignment under conflicting objectives through the lens of multiobjective optimization,"

A reward-free alignment framework addresses multi-objective conflicts in language models through conflict-averse gradient descent with clipping, improving Pareto trade-offs across diverse model architectures.  					AI-generated summary 				 Direct alignment methods are increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, many real-world alignment problems involve multiple conflicting objectives, where naive aggregation of preferences can lead to unstable training and poor trade-offs. In particular, weighted loss methods may fail to identify update directions that simultaneously improve all objectives, and existing multi-objective approaches often rely on explicit reward models, introducing additional complexity and distorting user-specified preferences. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a Reward-free Alignment framework for Conflicted Objectives (RACO) that directly leverages pairwise preference data and resolves gradient conflicts via a novel clipped variant of conflict-averse gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees to Pareto-critical points that respect user-specified objective weights, and further show that clipping can strictly improve convergence rate in the two-objective setting. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct experiments to demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed framework for LLM alignment. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on multi-objective summarization and safety alignment tasks across multiple LLM families (Qwen 3, Llama 3, Gemma 3) show that our method consistently achieves better Pareto trade-offs compared to existing multi-objective alignment baselines.

A large-scale building change detection dataset named FOTBCD is introduced, covering 28 French departments with high-resolution imagery and comprehensive annotations for both binary and instance-level change detection tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce FOTBCD, a large-scale building change detection dataset derived from authoritative French orthophotos and topographic building data provided by IGN France. Unlike existing benchmarks that are geographically constrained to single cities or limited regions, FOTBCD spans 28 departments across mainland France, with 25 used for training and three geographically disjoint departments held out for evaluation. The dataset covers diverse urban, suburban, and rural environments at 0.2m/pixel resolution. We publicly release FOTBCD-Binary, a dataset comprising approximately 28,000 before/after image pairs with pixel-wise binary building change masks, each associated with patch-level spatial metadata. The dataset is designed for large-scale benchmarking and evaluation under geographic domain shift, with validation and test samples drawn from held-out departments and manually verified to ensure label quality. In addition, we publicly release FOTBCD-Instances, a publicly available instance-level annotated subset comprising several thousand image pairs, which illustrates the complete annotation schema used in the full instance-level version of FOTBCD. Using a fixed reference baseline, we benchmark FOTBCD-Binary against LEVIR-CD+ and WHU-CD, providing strong empirical evidence that geographic diversity at the dataset level is associated with improved cross-domain generalization in building change detection.
