Code is available athttps:// github.com/ryyzn9/SAFE Keywords: RLHF, PPO, KL Divergence, Double Critic, Entropy Control, PID ControllerReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) Ouyang et al. [2022], Bai et al. [2022], Christiano et al. [2023] has become central paradigm for aligning large language models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, RLHF training remains highly unstable, particularly in long-horizon on-policy optimization. Practitioners routinely observe failure modes including reward oscillations, entropy collapse, value function drift, and sudden policy divergence that require frequent restarts and extensive hyperparameter tuning. Most existing stabilization approaches focus on single-axis control, typically through fixed or adaptive KullbackLeibler (KL) Schulman et al. [2017] regularization that constrains policy deviation from reference model. While effective at limiting distributional drift, KL-based control alone does not fully capture internal policy dynamics. In practice, policies may remain within acceptable KL bounds while undergoing progressive determinization, increased gradient sensitivity, or unstable value estimation, leading to degraded learning dynamics and brittle convergence behavior. critical but often overlooked source of instability is value overestimation in the critic network. Standard actor-critic methods rely on single value estimator that, due to bootstrapping 1 and function approximation error, systematically overestimates returns in high-variance regions. When the policy encounters outlier rewardswhether from genuine improvement or spurious reward model artifactsan overestimating critic amplifies these signals through inflated advantage estimates, driving overly aggressive policy updates that can trigger cascading instability. This positive feedback loop is particularly destructive in RLHF, where reward models themselves contain systematic biases and the policy operates over enormous discrete action spaces with delayed sparse feedback. These challenges become particularly pronounced in long training runs, where delayed instabilities often emerge after hundreds or thousands of optimization steps. Such late-stage failures are difficult to detect using instantaneous metrics and are not adequately addressed by static regularization schedules or symmetric divergence penalties. Addressing these coupled failure modes requires coordinated intervention across multiple levels of the optimization process. In this work, we introduce SAFE (Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-aware control), stabilized RLHF optimization framework that integrates complementary control mechanisms across three interacting layers: value estimation, divergence regulation, and training dynamics adaptation. Rather than relying on single stabilizer, SAFE combines pessimistic value aggregation, entropy-conditioned divergence control, and predictive threshold adaptation into unified training architecture. Contributions. Our contributions are: We identify and characterize interacting instability modes in long-horizon RLHF trainingincluding value overestimation, distributional drift, and entropy collapsethat are not adequately addressed by standard KL regularization alone. We propose SAFE, multi-layer stabilization framework that integrates pessimistic double soft-min value estimation to suppress overconfident updates, entropy-aware predictive control that couples asymmetric divergence regulation with adaptive entropy-based thresholding, and reward-driven PID adaptation to regulate exploration dynamics across training phases. We demonstrate empirically that coordinated control across value, policy, and temporal dynamics improves training stability and robustness without sacrificing reward performance, and provide theoretical analysis suggesting SAFE may offer partial resistance to reward hacking through its pessimistic critic mechanism. Together, these results suggest that robust RLHF optimization requires explicit multi-level control of value estimation, divergence dynamics, and exploration behavior rather than static regularization alone.Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) typically consists of three sequential stages Ouyang et al. [2022]: 1. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): pretrained language model is adapted to follow instructions using curated human demonstrations. 2 2. Reward Model Training: separate model is trained to approximate human preference judgments over generated responses. 3. Reinforcement Learning Optimization: The policy is optimized to maximize reward model outputs while remaining close to the supervised reference policy. The resulting optimization objective is commonly formulated as: L(θ) = ExD, yπθ (cid:2)r(x, y)(cid:3) + β DKL (cid:0)πθ πref (cid:1), (1) where r(x, y) denotes the learned reward model"

A new reinforcement learning algorithm for language model alignment that improves stability and performance over PPO through enhanced KL divergence control and adaptive reward management.  					AI-generated summary 				 Optimization (PPO) has been positioned by recent literature as the canonical method for the RL part of RLHF. PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner and suffers form reward oscillations, entropy collapse, value function drift, and sudden policy divergence that require frequent restarts and extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we develop a new pure on policy actor-critic RL method for the LM-RLHF setting. We present SAFE (Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-aware control),a novel RLHF algorithm that combines a Double Soft-Min Critic for pessimistic value estimation with a new multi-layer stabilization framework combining entropy-gated KL regulation, and PID-controlled adaptive thresholds. Unlike standard PPO's symmetric KL penalties, SAFE distinguishes high-entropy exploration from low-entropy mode collapse and adjusts penalties dynamically based on reward velocity. Experiments on a 3B parameter model show SAFE achieves +5.15\% training-average reward than PPO (0.725 vs 0.689), negligible reward crashes, and superior KL control than ppo . Our method adds minimal computational overhead and provides an interpretable, crash-resistant RLHF framework that maintains aggressive learning speed while ensuring stable long-horizon optimization suitable for production deployment.

Основное улучшение достигается за счёт более точного контроля KL-дивергенции и адаптивного управления вознаграждением с использованием двойного критика для пессимистичной оценки функции стоимости. Алгоритм применяет многоуровневую стабилизацию с энтропийно-управляемым регулированием KL-расхождения и адаптивными порогами, управляемыми контроллерами PID. Экспериментальные результаты показывают улучшение среднего вознаграждения на 5.15%, практически полное исчезновение сбоев вознаграждения и надёжную работу при производственном развёртывании.",
