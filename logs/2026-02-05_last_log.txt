Text:"Semantic Routing: Exploring Multi-Layer LLM Feature Weighting for Diffusion Transformers Bozhou Li 1 2 * Yushuo Guan 2 Haolin Li 3 Bohan Zeng 1 Yiyan Ji 4 Yue Ding 5 Pengfei Wan 2 Kun Gai 2 Yuanxing Zhang 2 Wentao Zhang 1 Code: https://github.com/zooblastlbz/SemanticRouting Abstract Recent DiT-based text-to-image models increasingly adopt LLMs as text encoders, yet text conditioning remains largely static and often utilizes only single LLM layer, despite pronounced semantic hierarchy across LLM layers and nonstationary denoising dynamics over both diffusion time and network depth. To better match the dynamic process of DiT generation and thereby enhance the diffusion models generative capability, we introduce unified normalized convex fusion framework equipped with lightweight gates to systematically organize multi-layer LLM hidden states via time-wise, depth-wise, and joint fusion. Experiments establish Depth-wise Semantic Routing as the superior conditioning strategy, consistently improving textimage alignment and compositional generation (e.g., +9.97 on the GenAI-Bench Counting task). Conversely, we find that purely time-wise fusion can paradoxically degrade visual generation fidelity. We attribute this to traininference trajectory mismatch: under classifier-free guidance, nominal timesteps fail to track the effective SNR, causing semantically mistimed feature injection during inference. Overall, our results position depth-wise routing as strong and effective baseline and highlight the critical need for trajectory-aware signals to enable robust time-dependent conditioning. 6 2 0 2 3 ] .

To address this, we introduce MEnvAgent, Multi-language framework for automated Environment construction that facilitates scalable generation of verifiable task instances. MEnvAgent employs multi-agent Planning-Execution-Verification architecture to autonomously resolve construction failures and integrates novel Environment Reuse Mechanism that reduces computational overhead by incrementally patching historical environments. Evaluations on MEnvBench, new benchmark comprising 1,000 tasks across 10 languages, demonstrate that MEnvAgent outperforms baselines, improving Fail-to-Pass (F2P) rates by 8.6% while reducing time costs by 43%. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of MEnvAgent by constructing MEnvData-SWE, the largest open-source polyglot dataset of realistic verifiable Docker environments to date, alongside solution trajectories that enable consistent performance gains on SWE tasks across wide range of models.

Comparison between manual environment construction and MEnvAgent (Ours). MEnvAgent leverages multi-agent collaboration to achieve automated environment construction, characterized by an efficient environment reuse mechanism. and its variants (Jimenez et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025c; Zan et al., 2025), have emerged as the standard for evaluating the coding capabilities of LLMs. In these settings, autonomous agents like OpenHands (Wang et al., 2025b) and SWE-Agent (Yang et al., 2024) are tasked with exploring repositories, localizing issues, generating patches (Pull Requests), and executing tests to validate solutions. This execution-based verification is pivotal, not only for evaluation but also for emerging training paradigms like Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) (Wen et al., 2025). However, the efficacy of such methods is constrained by the scalability of executable environment construction. Consequently, existing efforts face dilemma: approaches based on static code metrics (Xie et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2025) scale efficiently but provide only approximate verification signals, while manual construction (Pan et al., 2025) ensures quality but remains labor-intensive and largely restricted to Python. This leaves critical gap for scalable, verifiable support across diverse programming languages. MEnvAgent: Scalable Polyglot Environment Construction for Verifiable Software Engineering To bridge this gap, we introduce MEnvAgent, an automated framework engineered for scalable, polyglot environment construction (see Figure 1). Our approach aims to address two fundamental challenges in this field: (1) Complexity. Managing diverse dependencies across non-standard repositories requires deep expertise. Frequent construction failures (e.g., version conflicts, compilation errors) and inconsistent testing protocols (e.g., pytest or mvn test) often lead to low success rates. (2) Time Consumption. The build process is inherently slow due to installation and compilation steps. Furthermore, environments are fragile; single error often necessitates costly clean-slate restart, creating prohibitive overhead for large-scale data expansion. To tackle the complexity, we design multi-agent architecture featuring an iterative Planning-Execution-Verification closed loop. Within this loop, specialized agents fulfill distinct responsibilities to iteratively diagnose and autonomously resolve construction failures to ensure high success rates. To address the time consumption, we propose novel Environment Reuse Mechanism. Instead of building every instance from scratch, this mechanism retrieves similar historical environments and adapts them to the target repository snapshot by synthesizing and executing incremental environment patches. This approach avoids the heavy cost of full rebuilds, thereby boosting efficiency. Current environment construction benchmarks (Milliken et al., 2025; Eliseeva et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025) are limited by narrow language coverage, non-executable evaluation, or insufficient quality assurance. To address these limitations and rigorously evaluate our approach, we construct MEnvBench, comprehensive benchmark comprising 1,000 tasks across 10 languages, with strict executionbased evaluation and quality assurance. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MEnvAgent outperforms state-of-theart baselines across all languages, improving Fail-to-Pass (F2P) rates by 8.6% while reducing time costs by 43%. Furthermore, we leverage MEnvAgent to scale up verifiable data construction, yielding MEnvData-SWE, realistic verifiable SWE training dataset. By fine-tuning open-source models on solution trajectories synthesized from this dataset, we achieve substantial performance gains on downstream SWE tasks, effectively validating the utility of MEnvAgent. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: We introduce MEnvAgent, multi-agent environment construction framework covering 10 programming languages, based on Planning-Execution-Verification architecture. Notably, it incorporates novel environment reuse mechanism that significantly reduces computational overhead. We present MEnvBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multi-language executable environment construction. This benchmark covers 10 mainstream languages across 200 open-source repositories, comprising total of 1,000 tasks. We release MEnvData-SWE,"

Text conditioning in DiT-based models is enhanced through a unified normalized convex fusion framework that optimizes multi-layer LLM hidden states via depth-wise semantic routing, improving text-image alignment and compositional generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent DiT-based text-to-image models increasingly adopt LLMs as text encoders, yet text conditioning remains largely static and often utilizes only a single LLM layer, despite pronounced semantic hierarchy across LLM layers and non-stationary denoising dynamics over both diffusion time and network depth. To better match the dynamic process of DiT generation and thereby enhance the diffusion model's generative capability, we introduce a unified normalized convex fusion framework equipped with lightweight gates to systematically organize multi-layer LLM hidden states via time-wise, depth-wise, and joint fusion. Experiments establish Depth-wise Semantic Routing as the superior conditioning strategy, consistently improving text-image alignment and compositional generation (e.g., +9.97 on the GenAI-Bench Counting task). Conversely, we find that purely time-wise fusion can paradoxically degrade visual generation fidelity. We attribute this to a train-inference trajectory mismatch: under classifier-free guidance, nominal timesteps fail to track the effective SNR, causing semantically mistimed feature injection during inference. Overall, our results position depth-wise routing as a strong and effective baseline and highlight the critical need for trajectory-aware signals to enable robust time-dependent conditioning.

"Text conditioning in DiT-based models is enhanced through a unified normalized convex fusion framework that optimizes multi-layer LLM hidden states via depth-wise semantic routing, improving text-image alignment and compositional generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent DiT-based text-to-image models increasingly adopt LLMs as text encoders, yet text conditioning remains largely static and often utilizes only a single LLM layer, despite pronounced semantic hierarchy across LLM layers and non-stationary denoising dynamics over both diffusion time and network depth. To better match the dynamic process of DiT generation and thereby enhance the diffusion model's generative capability, we introduce a unified normalized convex fusion framework equipped with lightweight gates to systematically organize multi-layer LLM hidden states via time-wise, depth-wise, and joint fusion. Experiments establish Depth-wise Semantic Routing as the superior conditioning strategy, consistently improving text-image alignment and compositional generation (e.g., +9.97 on the GenAI-Bench Counting task). Conversely, we find that purely time-wise fusion can paradoxically degrade visual generation fidelity. We attribute this to a train-inference trajectory mismatch: under classifier-free guidance, nominal timesteps fail to track the effective SNR, causing semantically mistimed feature injection during inference. Overall, our results position depth-wise routing as a strong and effective baseline and highlight the critical need for trajectory-aware signals to enable robust time-dependent conditioning."

MEnvAgent is a multi-language framework that automates environment construction for software engineering tasks using a planning-execution-verification architecture and environment reuse mechanism, achieving improved performance on a new benchmark and creating the largest open-source polyglot dataset of verifiable Docker environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents for software engineering (SWE) is constrained by the scarcity of verifiable datasets, a bottleneck stemming from the complexity of constructing executable environments across diverse languages. To address this, we introduce MEnvAgent, a Multi-language framework for automated Environment construction that facilitates scalable generation of verifiable task instances. MEnvAgent employs a multi-agent Planning-Execution-Verification architecture to autonomously resolve construction failures and integrates a novel Environment Reuse Mechanism that reduces computational overhead by incrementally patching historical environments. Evaluations on MEnvBench, a new benchmark comprising 1,000 tasks across 10 languages, demonstrate that MEnvAgent outperforms baselines, improving Fail-to-Pass (F2P) rates by 8.6% while reducing time costs by 43%. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of MEnvAgent by constructing MEnvData-SWE, the largest open-source polyglot dataset of realistic verifiable Docker environments to date, alongside solution trajectories that enable consistent performance gains on SWE tasks across a wide range of models. Our code, benchmark, and dataset are available at https://github.com/ernie-research/MEnvAgent.
