Text:"One to rule them all: natural language to bind communication, perception and action Simone Colombani1,3, Dimitri Ognibene2 and Giuseppe Boccignone1 2University of Milan, Italy 1University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy 3Oversonic Robotics, Carate Brianza, Italy Abstract In recent years, research in the area of human-robot interaction has focused on developing robots capable of understanding complex human instructions and performing tasks in dynamic and diverse environments. These systems have wide range of applications, from personal assistance to industrial robotics, emphasizing the importance of robots interacting flexibly, naturally and safely with humans. This paper presents an advanced architecture for robotic action planning that integrates communication, perception, and planning with Large Language Models (LLMs). Our system is designed to translate commands expressed in natural language into executable robot actions, incorporating environmental information and dynamically updating plans based on real-time feedback. The Planner Module is the core of the system where LLMs embedded in modified ReAct framework are employed to interpret and carry out user commands like Go to the kitchen and pick up the blue bottle on the table. By leveraging their extensive pre-trained knowledge, LLMs can effectively process user requests without the need to introduce new knowledge on the changing environment. The modified ReAct framework further enhances the execution space by providing real-time environmental perception and the outcomes of physical actions. By combining robust and dynamic semantic map representations as graphs with control components and failure explanations, this architecture enhances robots adaptability, task execution efficiency, and seamless collaboration with human users in shared and dynamic environments. Through the integration of continuous feedback loops with the environment the system can dynamically adjusts the plan to accommodate unexpected changes,"

Recent large-scale diffusion models generate high-quality images but struggle to learn new, personalized artistic styles, which limits the creation of unique style templates. Fine-tuning with reference images is the most promising approach, but it often blindly utilizes objectives and noise level distributions used for pre-training, leading to suboptimal style alignment. We propose the Style-friendly SNR sampler, which aggressively shifts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distribution toward higher noise levels during fine-tuning to focus on noise levels where stylistic features emerge. This enables models to better capture unique styles and generate images with higher style alignment. Our method allows diffusion models to learn and share new "style templates", enhancing personalized content creation. We demonstrate the ability to generate styles such as personal watercolor paintings, minimal flat cartoons, 3D renderings, multi-panel images, and memes with text, thereby broadening the scope of style-driven generation.
