[ 1 7 0 4 7 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in AI agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving environments. To address this limitation, recent research has explored agent evolution techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems. In this survey, we provide comprehensive review of existing techniques for self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce unified conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components: System inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this framework, we systematically review wide range of self-evolving techniques that target different components of the agent system, including foundation models, agent prompts, memory, tools, workflows, and comm"

Grove MoE, a novel architecture with heterogeneous experts of varying sizes, improves computational efficiency and performance in large language models by dynamically activating parameters based on input complexity.  					AI-generated summary 				 The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is a cornerstone of modern state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). MoE models facilitate scalability by enabling sparse parameter activation. However, traditional MoE architecture uses homogeneous experts of a uniform size, activating a fixed number of parameters irrespective of input complexity and thus limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Grove MoE, a novel architecture incorporating experts of varying sizes, inspired by the heterogeneous big.LITTLE CPU architecture. This architecture features novel adjugate experts with a dynamic activation mechanism, enabling model capacity expansion while maintaining manageable computational overhead. Building on this architecture, we present GroveMoE-Base and GroveMoE-Inst, 33B-parameter LLMs developed by applying an upcycling strategy to the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base model during mid-training and post-training. GroveMoE models dynamically activate 3.14-3.28B parameters based on token complexity and achieve performance comparable to SOTA open-source models of similar or even larger size.

A survey of self-evolving AI agents that adapt to dynamic environments through automatic enhancement based on interaction data and feedback.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components: System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents, laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and lifelong agentic systems.

A novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method is introduced to compress large language models with minimal accuracy loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a predominant paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs). Despite offering strong performance and computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Kimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory requirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to address this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy drops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper introduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model compression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate matrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where matrix A is unique to each expert. The relatively larger matrix B is further re-parameterized as a linear combination of basis matrices {Bi} shared across all experts within a given MoE layer. The factorization is learned by minimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices. Experiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops compared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by 24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured relatively).

MoBE разлагает матрицы экспертов на уникальную для эксперта матрицу A и общую базисную матрицу B, которая параметризуется как линейная комбинация базисных матриц. Эксперименты показывают, что MoBE позволяет сократить количество параметров крупных моделей на 24-30% при снижении точности всего на 1-2%.
