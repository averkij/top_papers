Text:"FACT2FICTION: Targeted Poisoning Attack to Agentic Fact-checking System Haorui He1,2, Yupeng Li1,*, Bin Benjamin Zhu3, Dacheng Wen1,2, Reynold Cheng2, Francis C. M. Lau2 1Department of Interactive Media, Hong Kong Baptist University 2Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong 3Microsoft Corporation 5 2 0 2 8 ] . [ 1 9 5 0 6 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r Abstract State-of-the-art fact-checking systems combat misinformation at scale by employing autonomous LLM-based agents to decompose complex claims into smaller sub-claims, verify each sub-claim individually, and aggregate the partial results to produce verdicts with justifications (explanatory rationales for the verdicts). The security of these systems is crucial, as compromised fact-checkers, which tend to be easily underexplored, can amplify misinformation. This work introduces FACT2FICTION, the first poisoning attack framework targeting such agentic fact-checking systems. Fact2Fiction mirrors the decomposition strategy and exploits systemgenerated justifications to craft tailored malicious evidences that compromise sub-claim verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fact2Fiction achieves 8.9%21.2% higher attack success rates than state-of-the-art attacks across various poisoning budgets. Fact2Fiction exposes security weaknesses in current fact-checking systems and highlights the need for defensive countermeasures. The proliferation of misinformation has become pressing challenge in the digital era, with false information spreading at unprecedented scale across online platforms (Vlachos and Riedel 2014; Li et al. 2024). Traditional manual factchecking is inadequate to address the sheer volume of misinformation, which calls for the development of (automated) fact-checking systems to combat misinformation at scale. Fact-checking systems typically adopt the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework (Guo, Schlichtkrull, and Vlachos 2022; Schlichtkrull et al. 2024), which integrates large language mo"

Fact2Fiction is a poisoning attack framework that targets agentic fact-checking systems by exploiting their decomposition strategy and justifications, achieving higher attack success rates than existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 State-of-the-art fact-checking systems combat misinformation at scale by employing autonomous LLM-based agents to decompose complex claims into smaller sub-claims, verify each sub-claim individually, and aggregate the partial results to produce verdicts with justifications (explanatory rationales for the verdicts). The security of these systems is crucial, as compromised fact-checkers, which tend to be easily underexplored, can amplify misinformation. This work introduces Fact2Fiction, the first poisoning attack framework targeting such agentic fact-checking systems. Fact2Fiction mirrors the decomposition strategy and exploits system-generated justifications to craft tailored malicious evidences that compromise sub-claim verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fact2Fiction achieves 8.9\%--21.2\% higher attack success rates than state-of-the-art attacks across various poisoning budgets. Fact2Fiction exposes security weaknesses in current fact-checking systems and highlights the need for defensive countermeasures.
