Text:"SONAR-LLM: Autoregressive Transformer that Thinks in Sentence Embeddings and Speaks in Tokens Nikita Dragunov1, 2, Temurbek Rahmatullaev1, 2, Elizaveta Goncharova1, 3, Andrey Kuznetsov1, 4, Anton Razzhigaev1, 5 1AIRI 2MSU 3HSE 4Innopolis University 5Skoltech dragunov@airi.net 5 2 0 2 7 ] . [ 1 5 0 3 5 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r Abstract The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) (Barrault et al. 2024) generates text by predicting sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either meansquared error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, decoder-only transformer that thinks in the same continuous SONAR (Duquenne, Schwenk, and Sagot 2023) embedding space yet is supervised through tokenlevel cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its diffusion sampler and restoring likelihood-based training signal. Across model sizes from 39 to 1.3 parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results and release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster reproducibility and future research. Introduction Most autoregressive language models learn token-by-token: they minimise cross-entropy over discrete vocabulary and emit one token per forward step (Brown et al. 2020; Raffel et al. 2020). This fine-grained decoding is simple to train and evaluate but becomes throughput bottleneck for long sequences. Metas recently introduced Large Concept Model (LCM) (Barrault et al. 2024) addresses the latency issue by predicting much shorter trajectory of sentence-level embeddings trained with diffusion or MSE objective. Yet removing token-level likelihoods makes optimization less stable. We present SONAR-LLM, an autoregressive decoderonly transformer that keeps LCMs think in sentence embeddings idea while leveraging the advantages of crossentropy learning. The model predicts SONAR sentence embeddings but p"

SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer using token-level cross-entropy in the SONAR embedding space, achieves competitive text generation quality without diffusion sampling.  					AI-generated summary 				 The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster reproducibility and future research.
