With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated search agents powered by LLMs offer promising solution to liberate humans from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such "wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated due to lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce WideSearch, new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains, grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange it into well-organized output. rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most systems achieve overall success rates near 0%, with the best performer reaching just 5%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple human testers can achieve near 100% success rate. These results demonstrate that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and development in agentic search. Date: August 12, 2025 Correspondence: Yang Wang at wangyang.127@bytedance.com, Ke Wang at wangke@bytedance.com Project Page: https://widesearch-seed.github.io/With the advent of advanced agentic frameworks such as OpenAI DeepResearch [18] and Manus [15], the development of agent systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) is entering its second half, where the focus is rapidly shifting from demonstrating novel capabilities to achieving practical, real-world reliability. This transition is driven by fundamental recognition of the inherent limitations in standalone models: their finite parameters make it impossible to store all knowledge, the prohibitive cost of retraining makes them lag behind real-time information, and they naturally struggle with long-tail or specialized facts. Consequently, in this evolving domain, the ability to effectively utilize search tools has become paramount. The most critical question in this race is no longer just what an agent can do, but how we can measure and improve its ability to leverage search in authentic user scenarios to deliver tangible value and drive meaningful product iteration. 1 Figure 1 conceptual comparison of manual and agent-based approaches for WideSearch tasks. The diagram illustrates the operational workflow and inherent limitations associated with two distinct methodologies for large-scale information seeking. It contrasts the labor-intensive nature of the traditional manual approach with the potential efficiencies and novel failure modes of automated search agents. This comparison underscores the necessity for systematic evaluation to quantify agent performance and reliability. Our in-depth analysis of real-world user queries reveals significant gap: common and critical class of information-seeking tasks is not adequately evaluated by existing agent benchmarks. We term this category WideSearch, which involves tasks that require an agent to thoroughly and accurately acquire all large-scale atomic information meeting series of criteria, and then arrange it in well-organized output. For example, financial analyst may need to find all companies in sector that meet specific revenue and growth criteria, or job seeker may need to find all job vacancies that match their criteria for role, location, and experience level. For humans, executing such tasks is excruciatingly tedious; as depicted in Figure 1, the transition from this laborious manual process to an automated agent workflow promises immense efficiency gains, but also introduces new failure modes that demand systematic evaluation. Consequently, WideSearch carves out distinct problem space. As illustrated in Figure 2, it diverges from DeepSearch, which targets the "I cant find it" problem of locating specific, hard-to-find facts, and DeepResearch, which addresses the "I cant write it well" problem of synthesizing complex narratives. Instead, WideSearch tackles tasks whose primary challenge is not cognitive difficulty but operational scale and fidelitythe "I could do it, but the sheer volume is overwhelming" problema domain largely overlooked by current benchmarks. To systematically evaluate this paradigm, we introduce WideSearch, the first benchmark specifically designed for this purpose, supported by sophisticated multi-stage data collection and verification framework, as well as hybrid automated evaluation system that ensures objectivity. Benchmarking more than 10 stateof-the-art agent systems reveals stark reality: current systems are profoundly challenged by the demands of comprehensiveness and fidelity at scale. The overall success rate is exceptionally low, with even the top-performing multi-agent framework achieving mere 5.1%, and individual humans also struggling at 20%. Our key insight, derived from test-time scaling analysis, is that this failure does not stem from an inability to find individual factsitem-level F1 scores can approach 80% with sufficient retries. Rather, the bottleneck is that we must ensure the absolute completeness and accuracy of each atomic unit of information within large-scale search. Any single data omission or error, or the integration of extra data into the final result, results in total failure of the task execution. Our detailed error analysis traces this failure to fundamental deficiencies in advanced agentic capabilities, such as incomplete planning, lack of reflection to iterate on failed searches, and the inability to correctly use retrieved evidence. These findings provide clear roadmap, suggesting that future progress hinges on developing more sophisticated agent models and archi"

Text:"Technical Report Klear-Reasoner: Advancing Reasoning Capability via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization Zhenpeng Su Leiyu Pan Xue Bai Dening Liu Guanting Dong Wenping Hu Fuzheng Zhang Guorui Zhou Jiaming Huang Klear Team, Kuaishou Technology Github:https://github.com/suu990901/KlearReasoner Abstract We present Klear-Reasoner, model with long reasoning capabilities that demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that small number of highquality data sources are more effective than large number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only enhances the models exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5% on AIME 2024, 83.2% on AIME 2025, 66.0% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1% on LiveCodeBench V6. 5 2 0 2 1 1 ] .

We benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and development in agentic search. Our dataset, evaluation pipeline, and benchmark results have been publicly released at https://widesearch-seed.github.io/"

Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities, achieves high performance across benchmarks through detailed post-training workflows, including long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5\% on AIME 2024, 83.2\% on AIME 2025, 66.0\% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1\% on LiveCodeBench V6.

BrowseComp-Plus, a curated benchmark, enables controlled evaluation of deep research agents and retrieval methods, providing insights into their performance and effectiveness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep-Research agents, which integrate large language models (LLMs) with search tools, have shown success in improving the effectiveness of handling complex queries that require iterative search planning and reasoning over search results. Evaluations on current benchmarks like BrowseComp relies on black-box live web search APIs, have notable limitations in (1) fairness: dynamic and opaque web APIs hinder fair comparisons and reproducibility of deep research methods; (2) transparency: lack of control over the document corpus makes it difficult to isolate retriever contributions. In other words, the current evaluations may compare a complete deep research system at a given time, but they do not foster well-controlled experiments to provide insights into the capability of underlying deep research LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce BrowseComp-Plus, a benchmark derived from BrowseComp, employing a fixed, carefully curated corpus. Each query in BrowseComp-Plus includes human-verified supporting documents and mined challenging negatives, enabling controlled experimentation. The benchmark is shown to be effective in distinguishing the performance of deep research systems. For instance, the open-source model Search-R1, when paired with the BM25 retriever, achieves 3.86% accuracy, whereas the GPT-5 achieves 55.9%. Integrating the GPT-5 with the Qwen3-Embedding-8B retriever further enhances its accuracy to 70.1% with fewer search calls. This benchmark allows comprehensive evaluation and disentangled analysis of deep research agents and retrieval methods, fostering insights into retrieval effectiveness, citation accuracy, and context engineering in Deep-Research system.

Follow-Your-Shape framework uses a Trajectory Divergence Map and Scheduled KV Injection to enable precise and controllable shape editing in images while preserving non-target content.  					AI-generated summary 				 While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.

When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement."
