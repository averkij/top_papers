Introduction In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and evolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Recently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline. It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAIs o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models were the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-ofThought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge of effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior works have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024), and search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning performance comparable to OpenAIs o1 series models. In this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates small amount of cold-start data and multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217. We further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.532B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying RL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are crucial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey et al., 2024) series."

Text:"Autonomy-of-Experts Models Ang Lv 1 2 Ruobing Xie 2 Yining Qian 3 Songhao Wu 1 Xingwu Sun 2 Zhanhui Kang 2 Di Wang 2 Rui Yan 1 5 2 0 2 2 2 ] . [ 1 4 7 0 3 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r Abstract Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models mostly use router to assign tokens to specific expert modules, activating only partial parameters and often outperforming dense models. We argue that the separation between the routers decision-making and the experts execution is critical yet overlooked issue, leading to suboptimal expert selection and ineffective learning. To address this, we propose Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE), novel MoE paradigm in which experts autonomously select themselves to process inputs. AoE is based on the insight that an expert is aware of its own capacity to effectively process token, an awareness reflected in the scale of its internal activations. In AoE, routers are removed; instead, experts pre-compute internal activations for inputs and are ranked based on their activation norms. Only the top-ranking experts proceed with the forward pass, while the others abort. The overhead of pre-computing activations is reduced through low-rank weight factorization. This self-evaluating-then-partner-comparing approach ensures improved expert selection and effective learning. We pre-train language models having 700M up to 4B parameters, demonstrating that AoE outperforms traditional MoE models with comparable efficiency. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLM) built on Mixture-of-Experts techniques (MoE, Shazeer et al., 2017; Lepikhin et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022) have gained increasing research and industrial attention (Jiang et al., 2024; Dai et al., 2024; Team, 2024; Sun et al., 2024).

Text:"KIMI K1.5: TECHNICAL REPORT OF KIMI K1.5 Kimi TeamLanguage model pretraining with next token prediction has proved effective for scaling compute but is limited to the amount of available training data. Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalitiese.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVistamatching OpenAIs o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning resultse.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBenchoutperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by large margin (up to +550%). 5 2 0 2 2 2 ] . [ 1 9 9 5 2 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Kimi k1.5 long-CoT results. Kimi k1.5 TECHNICAL REPORT Figure 2: Kimi k1.5 short-CoT results.Language model pretraining with next token prediction has been studied under the context of the scaling law, where proportionally scaling model parameters and data sizes leads to the continued improvement of intelligence. (Kaplan et al. 2020; Hoffmann et al. 2022) However, this approach is limited to the amount of available high-quality training data (Villalobos et al. 2024; Muennighoff et al. 2023). In this report, we present the training recipe of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with reinforcement learning (RL). The goal is to explore possible new axis for continued scaling. Using RL with LLMs, the models learns to explore with rewards and thus is not limited to pre-existing static dataset. There are few key ingredients about the design and training of k1.5. Long context scaling. We scale the context window of RL to 128k and observe continued improvement of performance with an increased context length. key idea behind our approach is to use partial rollouts to improve training efficiencyi.e., sampling new trajectories by reusing large chunk of previous trajectories, avoiding the cost to re-generate the new trajectories from scratch. Our observation identifies the context length as key dimension of the continued scaling of RL with LLMs. Improved policy optimization. We derive formulation of RL with long-CoT and employ variant of online mirror descent for robust policy optimization. This algorithm is further improved by our effective sampling strategy, length penalty, and optimization of the data recipe. Simplistic Framework. Long context scaling, combined with the improved policy optimization methods, establishes simplistic RL framework for learning with LLMs. Since we are able to scale the context length, the learned CoTs exhibit the properties of planning, reflection, and correction. An increased context length has an effect of increasing the number of search steps. As result, we show that strong performance can be achieved without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Multimodalities. Our model is jointly trained on text and vision data, which has the capabilities of jointly reasoning over the two modalities. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models. Specifically, our approaches include applying length penalty with long-CoT activations and model merging. Our long-CoT version achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalitiese.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVistamatching OpenAIs o1. Our model also achieves state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning resultse.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBenchoutperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by large margin (up to +550%). Results are shown in Figures 1 and 2. 2 Kimi k1.5 TECHNICAL REPORTThe development of Kimi k1.5 consists of several stages: pretraining, vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT), long-CoT supervised fine-turning, and reinforcement learning (RL). This report focuses on RL, beginning with an overview of the RL prompt set curation (Section 2.1) and long-CoT supervised finetuning (Section 2.2), followed by an in-depth discussion of RL training strategies in Section 2.3. Additional details on pretraining and vanilla supervised finetuning can be found in Section 2.5. 2.1 RL Prompt Set Curation Through our preliminary experiments, we found that the quality and diversity of the RL prompt set play critical role in ensuring the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. well-constructed prompt set not only guides the model toward robust reasoning but also mitigates the risk of reward hacking and overfitting to superficial patterns. Specifically, three key properties define high-quality RL prompt set: Diverse Coverage: Prompts should span wide array of disciplines, such as STEM, coding, and general reasoning, to enhance the models adaptability and ensure broad applicability across different domains. Balanced Difficulty: The prompt set should include well-distributed range of easy, moderate, and difficult questions to facilitate gradual learning and prevent overfitting to specific complexity levels. Accurate Evaluability: Prompts should allow objective and reliable assessment by verifiers, ensuring that model performance is measured based on correct reasoning rather than superficial patterns or random guess. To achieve diverse coverage in the prompt set, we employ automatic filters to select questions that require rich reasoning and are straightforward to evaluate. Our dataset includes problems from various domains, such as STEM fields, competitions, and general reasoning tasks, incorporating both text-only and"

Virtual film production requires intricate decision-making processes, including scriptwriting, virtual cinematography, and precise actor positioning and actions. Motivated by recent advances in automated decision-making with language agent-based societies, this paper introduces FilmAgent, a novel LLM-based multi-agent collaborative framework for end-to-end film automation in our constructed 3D virtual spaces. FilmAgent simulates various crew roles, including directors, screenwriters, actors, and cinematographers, and covers key stages of a film production workflow: (1) idea development transforms brainstormed ideas into structured story outlines; (2) scriptwriting elaborates on dialogue and character actions for each scene; (3) cinematography determines the camera setups for each shot. A team of agents collaborates through iterative feedback and revisions, thereby verifying intermediate scripts and reducing hallucinations. We evaluate the generated videos on 15 ideas and 4 key aspects. Human evaluation shows that FilmAgent outperforms all baselines across all aspects and scores 3.98 out of 5 on average, showing the feasibility of multi-agent collaboration in filmmaking. Further analysis reveals that FilmAgent, despite using the less advanced GPT-4o model, surpasses the single-agent o1, showing the advantage of a well-coordinated multi-agent system. Lastly, we discuss the complementary strengths and weaknesses of OpenAI's text-to-video model Sora and our FilmAgent in filmmaking.

"Virtual film production requires intricate decision-making processes, including scriptwriting, virtual cinematography, and precise actor positioning and actions. Motivated by recent advances in automated decision-making with language agent-based societies, this paper introduces FilmAgent, a novel LLM-based multi-agent collaborative framework for end-to-end film automation in our constructed 3D virtual spaces. FilmAgent simulates various crew roles, including directors, screenwriters, actors, and cinematographers, and covers key stages of a film production workflow: (1) idea development transforms brainstormed ideas into structured story outlines; (2) scriptwriting elaborates on dialogue and character actions for each scene; (3) cinematography determines the camera setups for each shot. A team of agents collaborates through iterative feedback and revisions, thereby verifying intermediate scripts and reducing hallucinations. We evaluate the generated videos on 15 ideas and 4 key aspects. Human evaluation shows that FilmAgent outperforms all baselines across all aspects and scores 3.98 out of 5 on average, showing the feasibility of multi-agent collaboration in filmmaking. Further analysis reveals that FilmAgent, despite using the less advanced GPT-4o model, surpasses the single-agent o1, showing the advantage of a well-coordinated multi-agent system. Lastly, we discuss the complementary strengths and weaknesses of OpenAI's text-to-video model Sora and our FilmAgent in filmmaking."

We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models mostly use a router to assign tokens to specific expert modules, activating only partial parameters and often outperforming dense models. We argue that the separation between the router's decision-making and the experts' execution is a critical yet overlooked issue, leading to suboptimal expert selection and ineffective learning. To address this, we propose Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE), a novel MoE paradigm in which experts autonomously select themselves to process inputs. AoE is based on the insight that an expert is aware of its own capacity to effectively process a token, an awareness reflected in the scale of its internal activations. In AoE, routers are removed; instead, experts pre-compute internal activations for inputs and are ranked based on their activation norms. Only the top-ranking experts proceed with the forward pass, while the others abort. The overhead of pre-computing activations is reduced through a low-rank weight factorization. This self-evaluating-then-partner-comparing approach ensures improved expert selection and effective learning. We pre-train language models having 700M up to 4B parameters, demonstrating that AoE outperforms traditional MoE models with comparable efficiency.

Language model pretraining with next token prediction has proved effective for scaling compute but is limited to the amount of available training data. Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%).

"Language model pretraining with next token prediction has proved effective for scaling compute but is limited to the amount of available training data. Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%)."
