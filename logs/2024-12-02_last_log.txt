Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of general multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, adapting general MLLMs to specific domains, such as scientific fields and industrial applications, remains less explored. This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs through post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipelines, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using open-source models, we develop a visual instruction synthesizer that effectively generates diverse visual instruction tasks from domain-specific image-caption pairs. Our synthetic tasks surpass those generated by manual rules, GPT-4, and GPT-4V in enhancing the domain-specific performance of MLLMs. (2) Training Pipeline: While the two-stage training--initially on image-caption pairs followed by visual instruction tasks--is commonly adopted for developing general MLLMs, we apply a single-stage training pipeline to enhance task diversity for domain-specific post-training. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct experiments in two domains, biomedicine and food, by post-training MLLMs of different sources and scales (e.g., Qwen2-VL-2B, LLaVA-v1.6-8B, Llama-3.2-11B), and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. To support further research in MLLM domain adaptation, we will open-source our implementations.

Recent advancements in video generation have been greatly driven by video diffusion models, with camera motion control emerging as a crucial challenge in creating view-customized visual content. This paper introduces trajectory attention, a novel approach that performs attention along available pixel trajectories for fine-grained camera motion control. Unlike existing methods that often yield imprecise outputs or neglect temporal correlations, our approach possesses a stronger inductive bias that seamlessly injects trajectory information into the video generation process. Importantly, our approach models trajectory attention as an auxiliary branch alongside traditional temporal attention. This design enables the original temporal attention and the trajectory attention to work in synergy, ensuring both precise motion control and new content generation capability, which is critical when the trajectory is only partially available. Experiments on camera motion control for images and videos demonstrate significant improvements in precision and long-range consistency while maintaining high-quality generation. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be extended to other video motion control tasks, such as first-frame-guided video editing, where it excels in maintaining content consistency over large spatial and temporal ranges.

"Recent advancements in video generation have been greatly driven by video diffusion models, with camera motion control emerging as a crucial challenge in creating view-customized visual content. This paper introduces trajectory attention, a novel approach that performs attention along available pixel trajectories for fine-grained camera motion control. Unlike existing methods that often yield imprecise outputs or neglect temporal correlations, our approach possesses a stronger inductive bias that seamlessly injects trajectory information into the video generation process. Importantly, our approach models trajectory attention as an auxiliary branch alongside traditional temporal attention. This design enables the original temporal attention and the trajectory attention to work in synergy, ensuring both precise motion control and new content generation capability, which is critical when the trajectory is only partially available. Experiments on camera motion control for images and videos demonstrate significant improvements in precision and long-range consistency while maintaining high-quality generation. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be extended to other video motion control tasks, such as first-frame-guided video editing, where it excels in maintaining content consistency over large spatial and temporal ranges."
