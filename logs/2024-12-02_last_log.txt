Rapid development of artificial intelligence has drastically accelerated the
development of scientific discovery. Trained with large-scale observation data,
deep neural networks extract the underlying patterns in an end-to-end manner
and assist human researchers with highly-precised predictions in unseen
scenarios. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the empowered
autonomous agents enable scientists to gain help through interaction in
different stages of their research, including but not limited to literature
review, research ideation, idea implementation, and academic writing. However,
AI researchers instantiated by foundation model empowered agents with
full-process autonomy are still in their infancy. In this paper, we study
$\textbf{AI-Generated Science}$ (AIGS), where agents independently and
autonomously complete the entire research process and discover scientific laws.
By revisiting the definition of scientific research, we argue that
$\textit{falsification}$ is the essence of both human research process and the
design of an AIGS system. Through the lens of falsification, prior systems
attempting towards AI-Generated Science either lack the part in their design,
or rely heavily on existing verification engines that narrow the use in
specialized domains. In this work, we propose Baby-AIGS as a baby-step
demonstration of a full-process AIGS system, which is a multi-agent system with
agents in roles representing key research process. By introducing
FalsificationAgent, which identify and then verify possible scientific
discoveries, we empower the system with explicit falsification. Experiments on
three tasks preliminarily show that Baby-AIGS could produce meaningful
scientific discoveries, though not on par with experienced human researchers.
Finally, we discuss on the limitations of current Baby-AIGS, actionable
insights, and related ethical issues in detail.

In the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt optimization is crucial
for model performance. Although previous research has explored aspects like
rephrasing prompt contexts, using various prompting techniques (like in-context
learning and chain-of-thought), and ordering few-shot examples, our
understanding of LLM sensitivity to prompt templates remains limited.
Therefore, this paper examines the impact of different prompt templates on LLM
performance. We formatted the same contexts into various human-readable
templates, including plain text, Markdown, JSON, and YAML, and evaluated their
impact across tasks like natural language reasoning, code generation, and
translation using OpenAI's GPT models. Experiments show that GPT-3.5-turbo's
performance varies by up to 40\% in a code translation task depending on the
prompt template, while larger models like GPT-4 are more robust to these
variations. Our analysis highlights the need to reconsider the use of fixed
prompt templates, as different formats can significantly affect model
performance.

"In the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt optimization is crucial
for model performance. Although previous research has explored aspects like
rephrasing prompt contexts, using various prompting techniques (like in-context
learning and chain-of-thought), and ordering few-shot examples, our
understanding of LLM sensitivity to prompt templates remains limited.
Therefore, this paper examines the impact of different prompt templates on LLM
performance. We formatted the same contexts into various human-readable
templates, including plain text, Markdown, JSON, and YAML, and evaluated their
impact across tasks like natural language reasoning, code generation, and
translation using OpenAI's GPT models. Experiments show that GPT-3.5-turbo's
performance varies by up to 40\% in a code translation task depending on the
prompt template, while larger models like GPT-4 are more robust to these
variations. Our analysis highlights the need to reconsider the use of fixed
prompt templates, as different formats can significantly affect model
performance."
