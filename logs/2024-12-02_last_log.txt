In-context Learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to tackle downstream tasks through sophisticated prompting and high-quality demonstrations. However, this traditional ICL paradigm shows limitations when facing complex mathematical reasoning tasks, primarily due to its heavy dependence on example quality and the necessity for human intervention in challenging scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper presents HiAR-ICL, a High-level Automated Reasoning paradigm in ICL that shifts focus from specific examples to abstract thinking patterns, extending the conventional concept of context in ICL. HiAR-ICL introduces five atomic reasoning actions as fundamental components for constructing chain-structured patterns. Using Monte Carlo Tree Search, we explore reasoning paths and construct thought cards to guide subsequent inference. We then develop a cognitive complexity framework that dynamically matches problems with appropriate thought cards. Experimental results demonstrate HiAR-ICL's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy (79.6%) on the MATH benchmark with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, surpassing GPT-4o (76.6%) and Claude 3.5 (71.1%).

Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of general multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, adapting general MLLMs to specific domains, such as scientific fields and industrial applications, remains less explored. This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs through post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipelines, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using open-source models, we develop a visual instruction synthesizer that effectively generates diverse visual instruction tasks from domain-specific image-caption pairs. Our synthetic tasks surpass those generated by manual rules, GPT-4, and GPT-4V in enhancing the domain-specific performance of MLLMs. (2) Training Pipeline: While the two-stage training--initially on image-caption pairs followed by visual instruction tasks--is commonly adopted for developing general MLLMs, we apply a single-stage training pipeline to enhance task diversity for domain-specific post-training. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct experiments in two domains, biomedicine and food, by post-training MLLMs of different sources and scales (e.g., Qwen2-VL-2B, LLaVA-v1.6-8B, Llama-3.2-11B), and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. To support further research in MLLM domain adaptation, we will open-source our implementations.

近年来，通用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）取得了快速发展。然而，将这些通用模型应用到特定领域，如科学和工业，仍然较少探索。本文系统地研究了通过后训练进行MLLMs的领域适应，重点是数据合成、训练流水线和任务评估。我们开发了一个视觉指令合成器，能够从特定领域的图片-标题对中生成多样化的视觉指令任务。我们的合成任务在增强MLLMs的领域特定性能方面优于手动规则、GPT-4和GPT-4V生成的任务。我们还使用单阶段训练流水线来增强特定领域的任务多样性。我们在生物医学和食品领域进行了实验，并评估了不同来源和规模的MLLMs在各种特定领域任务上的性能。为支持进一步研究，我们将开源我们的实现。
