Video depth estimation lifts monocular video clips to 3D by inferring dense depth at every frame. Recent advances in single-image depth estimation, brought about by the rise of large foundation models and the use of synthetic training data, have fueled a renewed interest in video depth. However, naively applying a single-image depth estimator to every frame of a video disregards temporal continuity, which not only leads to flickering but may also break when camera motion causes sudden changes in depth range. An obvious and principled solution would be to build on top of video foundation models, but these come with their own limitations; including expensive training and inference, imperfect 3D consistency, and stitching routines for the fixed-length (short) outputs. We take a step back and demonstrate how to turn a single-image latent diffusion model (LDM) into a state-of-the-art video depth estimator. Our model, which we call RollingDepth, has two main ingredients: (i) a multi-frame depth estimator that is derived from a single-image LDM and maps very short video snippets (typically frame triplets) to depth snippets. (ii) a robust, optimization-based registration algorithm that optimally assembles depth snippets sampled at various different frame rates back into a consistent video. RollingDepth is able to efficiently handle long videos with hundreds of frames and delivers more accurate depth videos than both dedicated video depth estimators and high-performing single-frame models.

With the ever-increasing number of news stories available online, classifying them by topic, regardless of the language they are written in, has become crucial for enhancing readers' access to relevant content. To address this challenge, we propose a teacher-student framework based on large language models (LLMs) for developing multilingual news classification models of reasonable size with no need for manual data annotation. The framework employs a Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model as the teacher model to develop an IPTC Media Topic training dataset through automatic annotation of news articles in Slovenian, Croatian, Greek, and Catalan. The teacher model exhibits a high zero-shot performance on all four languages. Its agreement with human annotators is comparable to that between the human annotators themselves. To mitigate the computational limitations associated with the requirement of processing millions of texts daily, smaller BERT-like student models are fine-tuned on the GPT-annotated dataset. These student models achieve high performance comparable to the teacher model. Furthermore, we explore the impact of the training data size on the performance of the student models and investigate their monolingual, multilingual and zero-shot cross-lingual capabilities. The findings indicate that student models can achieve high performance with a relatively small number of training instances, and demonstrate strong zero-shot cross-lingual abilities. Finally, we publish the best-performing news topic classifier, enabling multilingual classification with the top-level categories of the IPTC Media Topic schema.

Большая языковая модель GPT выступает в роли учителя, автоматически аннотируя новостные статьи на четырех языках. Модели-ученики на основе BERT обучаются на этих данных, достигая высокой производительности при меньших вычислительных затратах. Исследование показывает эффективность метода для многоязычной и кросс-языковой классификации новостей.",

"With the ever-increasing number of news stories available online, classifying them by topic, regardless of the language they are written in, has become crucial for enhancing readers' access to relevant content. To address this challenge, we propose a teacher-student framework based on large language models (LLMs) for developing multilingual news classification models of reasonable size with no need for manual data annotation. The framework employs a Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model as the teacher model to develop an IPTC Media Topic training dataset through automatic annotation of news articles in Slovenian, Croatian, Greek, and Catalan. The teacher model exhibits a high zero-shot performance on all four languages. Its agreement with human annotators is comparable to that between the human annotators themselves.
