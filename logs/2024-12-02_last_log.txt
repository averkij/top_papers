'emoji': emoji that will reflect the theme of an article somehow, only one emoji. 'title': a slogan of a main idea of the article in Russian. Return only JSON and nothing else.

Rapid development of artificial intelligence has drastically accelerated the
development of scientific discovery. Trained with large-scale observation data,
deep neural networks extract the underlying patterns in an end-to-end manner
and assist human researchers with highly-precised predictions in unseen
scenarios. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the empowered
autonomous agents enable scientists to gain help through interaction in
different stages of their research, including but not limited to literature
review, research ideation, idea implementation, and academic writing. However,
AI researchers instantiated by foundation model empowered agents with
full-process autonomy are still in their infancy. In this paper, we study
$\textbf{AI-Generated Science}$ (AIGS), where agents independently and
autonomously complete the entire research process and discover scientific laws.
By revisiting the definition of scientific research, we argue that
$\textit{falsification}$ is the essence of both human research process and the
design of an AIGS system. Through the lens of falsification, prior systems
attempting towards AI-Generated Science either lack the part in their design,
or rely heavily on existing verification engines that narrow the use in
specialized domains. In this work, we propose Baby-AIGS as a baby-step
demonstration of a full-process AIGS system, which is a multi-agent system with
agents in roles representing key research process. By introducing
FalsificationAgent, which identify and then verify possible scientific
discoveries, we empower the system with explicit falsification. Experiments on
three tasks preliminarily show that Baby-AIGS could produce meaningful
scientific discoveries, though not on par with experienced human researchers.
Finally, we discuss on the limitations of current Baby-AIGS, actionable
insights, and related ethical issues in detail.

In the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt optimization is crucial
for model performance. Although previous research has explored aspects like
rephrasing prompt contexts, using various prompting techniques (like in-context
learning and chain-of-thought), and ordering few-shot examples, our
understanding of LLM sensitivity to prompt templates remains limited.
Therefore, this paper examines the impact of different prompt templates on LLM
performance. We formatted the same contexts into various human-readable
templates, including plain text, Markdown, JSON, and YAML, and evaluated their
impact across tasks like natural language reasoning, code generation, and
translation using OpenAI's GPT models. Experiments show that GPT-3.5-turbo's
performance varies by up to 40\% in a code translation task depending on the
prompt template, while larger models like GPT-4 are more robust to these
variations. Our analysis highlights the need to reconsider the use of fixed
prompt templates, as different formats can significantly affect model
performance.

[02.12.2024 14:10] Abstract 0. In-context Learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to tackle downstream tasks through sophisticated prompting and high-quality demonstrations. However, this traditional ICL paradigm shows limitations when facing complex mathematical reasoning tasks, primarily due to its heavy dependence ...

[02.12.2024 14:10] Abstract 1. Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of general multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, adapting general MLLMs to specific domains, such as scientific fields and industrial applications, remains less explored. This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs ...

[02.12.2024 14:10] Abstract 2. As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are challenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising. Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that...

[02.12.2024 14:10] Abstract 3. Recent advancements in video generation have been greatly driven by video diffusion models, with camera motion control emerging as a crucial challenge in creating view-customized visual content. This paper introduces trajectory attention, a novel approach that performs attention along available pixe...
[02.12.2024 14:10] ********************************************************************************
[02.12.2024 14:10] Abstract 4. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their adoption is limited by high computational costs during inference. While increasing parameter counts enhances accuracy, it also widens the gap between state-of-the-art capabilities and practical deployability. We presen...
[02.12.2024 14:10] ********************************************************************************
[02.12.2024 14:10] Abstract 5. Human motion, inherently continuous and dynamic, presents significant challenges for generative models. Despite their dominance, discrete quantization methods, such as VQ-VAEs, suffer from inherent limitations, including restricted expressiveness and frame-wise noise artifacts. Continuous approaches...
[02.12.2024 14:10] ********************************************************************************
[02.12.2024 14:10] Abstract 6. We introduce AlphaTablets, a novel and generic representation of 3D planes that features continuous 3D surface and precise boundary delineation. By representing 3D planes as rectangles with alpha channels, AlphaTablets combine the advantages of current 2D and 3D plane representations, enabling accur...

[02.12.2024 14:10] Abstract 7. With the growing scale and complexity of video data, efficiently processing long video sequences poses significant challenges due to the quadratic increase in memory and computational demands associated with existing transformer-based Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs). To address these issues, we intr...
[02.12.2024 14:10] ********************************************************************************
[02.12.2024 14:10] Abstract 8. Diffusion models are proficient at generating high-quality images. They are however effective only when operating at the resolution used during training. Inference at a scaled resolution leads to repetitive patterns and structural distortions. Retraining at higher resolutions quickly becomes prohibi...
[02.12.2024 14:10] ********************************************************************************
[02.12.2024 14:10] Abstract 9. Video depth estimation lifts monocular video clips to 3D by inferring dense depth at every frame. Recent advances in single-image depth estimation, brought about by the rise of large foundation models and the use of synthetic training data, have fueled a renewed interest in video depth. However, nai...

[02.12.2024 14:10] Abstract 10. Numerous works have recently integrated 3D camera control into foundational text-to-video models, but the resulting camera control is often imprecise, and video generation quality suffers. In this work, we analyze camera motion from a first principles perspective, uncovering insights that enable pre...

[02.12.2024 14:10] Abstract 11. With the ever-increasing number of news stories available online, classifying them by topic, regardless of the language they are written in, has become crucial for enhancing readers' access to relevant content. To address this challenge, we propose a teacher-student framework based on large language...
