Text:"4 2 0 2 8 2 ] . [ 1 5 1 9 8 1 . 1 1 4 2 : r MATATA: weak-supervised MAthematical Tool-Assisted reasoning for Tabular Applications Vishnou Vinayagame, Gregory Senay, and Luis Martí Docugami Inc, Kirkland, WA 98033, USA http://www.docugami.com {vishnou,greg,lmarti}@docugami.com Abstract. Mathematical reasoning capabilities are increasing with toolaugmented language agents, but methods often rely either on closedsource or large models, external data, or extensive prompt engineering. This work introduces MATATA, novel cost-eﬀective method to train LLM agents for tabular data problems through reasoning, planning, and tool use. With progressive self-improvement paradigm and an iterative weak supervision, it empowers 3.8B/8B Small Language Models (SLMs), particularly suited for local hosting and sensitive business contexts where data privacy is crucial. By employing ﬂexible and reusable tools across diﬀerent datasets, it achieves robust performance with eﬀective scalability across shared tasks. Experiments show that MATATA reaches state-of-the-art performances on FinQA and TAT-QA among reasoning frameworks based on open-source models. Moreover, MATATA models compete with GPT-4 based frameworks on TabMWP, while being SLMs. Keywords: Mathematical Reasoning Small Language Model WeakSupervision. Recent developments have popularized Large Language Models (LLMs) [1,3,24] as potent tools for tackling complex mathematical reasoning problems [18]. Different strategies encompass an extensive range of techniques, including specialized models like [21, 31], Chain-of-Thought or Program-of-Thought [4, 25], or, tool-based compositional frameworks like [8, 14, 16, 27]. Progress in the study of mathematical reasoning with structured and unstructured data has been tangible thanks to various datasets and benchmarks, such as [5, 17, 30]. Tool-augmented LLMs are particularly prevalent in those benchmarks as they combine program assistance, data manipulation, natural language reasoning, and man"

Mathematical reasoning capabilities are increasing with tool-augmented language agents, but methods often rely either on closed-source or large models, external data, or extensive prompt engineering. This work introduces MATATA, a novel cost-effective method to train LLM agents for tabular data problems through reasoning, planning, and tool use. With a progressive self-improvement paradigm and an iterative weak supervision, it empowers 3.8B/8B Small Language Models (SLMs), particularly suited for local hosting and sensitive business contexts where data privacy is crucial. By employing a flexible and reusable tools across different datasets, it achieves robust performance with effective scalability across shared tasks. Experiments show that MATATA reaches state-of-the-art performances on FinQA and TAT-QA among reasoning frameworks based on open-source models. Moreover, MATATA models compete with GPT-4 based frameworks on TabMWP, while being SLMs.

Despite the recent advancements of vision-language-action (VLA) models on a variety of robotics tasks, they suffer from critical issues such as poor generalizability to unseen tasks, due to their reliance on behavior cloning exclusively from successful rollouts. Furthermore, they are typically fine-tuned to replicate demonstrations collected by experts under different settings, thus introducing distribution bias and limiting their adaptability to diverse manipulation objectives, such as efficiency, safety, and task completion. To bridge this gap, we introduce GRAPE: Generalizing Robot Policy via Preference Alignment. Specifically, GRAPE aligns VLAs on a trajectory level and implicitly models reward from both successful and failure trials to boost generalizability to diverse tasks. Moreover, GRAPE breaks down complex manipulation tasks to independent stages and automatically guides preference modeling through customized spatiotemporal constraints with keypoints proposed by a large vision-language model. Notably, these constraints are flexible and can be customized to align the model with varying objectives, such as safety, efficiency, or task success. We evaluate GRAPE across a diverse array of tasks in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GRAPE enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models, increasing success rates on in-domain and unseen manipulation tasks by 51.79% and 60.36%, respectively. Additionally, GRAPE can be aligned with various objectives, such as safety and efficiency, reducing collision rates by 44.31% and rollout step-length by 11.15%, respectively.
