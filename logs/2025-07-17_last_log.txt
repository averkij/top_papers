SpatialTrackerV2 is a feed-forward 3D point tracking method for monocular videos that integrates point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a unified, end-to-end architecture, achieving high performance and speed.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present SpatialTrackerV2, a feed-forward 3D point tracking method for monocular videos. Going beyond modular pipelines built on off-the-shelf components for 3D tracking, our approach unifies the intrinsic connections between point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a high-performing and feedforward 3D point tracker. It decomposes world-space 3D motion into scene geometry, camera ego-motion, and pixel-wise object motion, with a fully differentiable and end-to-end architecture, allowing scalable training across a wide range of datasets, including synthetic sequences, posed RGB-D videos, and unlabeled in-the-wild footage. By learning geometry and motion jointly from such heterogeneous data, SpatialTrackerV2 outperforms existing 3D tracking methods by 30%, and matches the accuracy of leading dynamic 3D reconstruction approaches while running 50times faster.

RLEP, a reinforcement learning framework with experience replay, enhances large language model training by focusing on high-quality examples, leading to faster convergence and improved performance on math-related benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away from its pretrained weights. We present RLEP\, -- \,Reinforcement Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration, focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model, RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%, on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our code, datasets, and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/Kwai-Klear/RLEP to facilitate reproducibility and further research.

Он фокусируется на высококачественных примерах, что приводит к более быстрой сходимости и улучшенной производительности на математических бенчмарках. RLEP использует двухфазный подход: сначала собирает проверенные траектории, а затем воспроизводит их во время последующего обучения. Этот метод позволяет избежать бесполезного исследования и сосредоточиться на перспективных путях рассуждений.",
