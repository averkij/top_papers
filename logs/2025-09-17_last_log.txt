Code and data: https://github.com/iamsalvatore/room. I. INTRODUCTION Continuum robots have emerged as an innovative technology in minimally invasive surgery, with bronchoscopy 1University of Edinburgh, UK. 2University of British Columbia, Canada. This work was supported by UKRI Turing AI World Leading Researcher Fellowship on AI for Person-Centred and Teachable Autonomy (grant EP/Z534833/1) representing one of the most promising applications. These flexible, cable-driven systems can navigate the intricate branching networks of human airways with unprecedented dexterity, enabling precise drug delivery, tissue sampling, and diagnostic imaging in lung regions previously inaccessible to rigid instruments [1]. Continuum robots can enable early intervention in peripheral lung nodules, targeted chemotherapy delivery, and real-time biopsy guidance, significantly improving patient outcomes in pulmonary medicine. Nevertheless, the development of autonomous navigation algorithms for continuum robot bronchoscopy faces datarelated limitations. Clinical data collection is inherently constrained by patient safety protocols, ethical review processes, and the high costs associated with experimental procedures. More fundamentally, the individualised nature of human anatomy means that effective algorithms must generalise across diverse airway geometries while maintaining millimetre-level precision [1]. Synthetic data generation has demonstrated remarkable success in addressing similar challenges across robotics applications from autonomous driving to visual SLAM [2], [3]. In the medical context, some recent efforts have focused on data generation for colonoscopy, as done by the SimCol3D Challenge [4], or on simulation frameworks for surgical procedures [5]. However, bronchoscopy procedures require anatomical fidelity, procedure-specific lighting conditions, as well as specific kinematics and sensor modalities calibrated to clinical scales. In this paper, we introduce ROOM (Realistic Optical Observation in Medicine), simulation framework engineered for continuum robot bronchoscopy applications. ROOM Fig. 2: ROOM data generation pipeline. The system consists of four main stages: (1) Medial Axis Extraction from segmented CT lung models, (2) Automated Sampling along skeletal branches with higher density at bifurcations and high-curvature regions, (3) Data Synthesis generating synchronized multi-modal sensor streams from t0 to tn timesteps, and (4) Sensor Noise Modeling applying realistic noise characteristics matching real bronchoscopy imagery through frequency-domain analysis. provides the first fully automated pipeline that transforms patient CT scan data into extensive synthetic training datasets while preserving the geometric constraints and visual characteristics essential for medical navigation tasks inside the vessels and airways of the anatomical structures. Our system generates photorealistic multi-modal sensor data, including RGB imagery with realistic noise, metric depth maps, surface normals, point clouds, and optical flow, all calibrated to the millimetre scales typical of bronchoscopy procedures, as shown in Fig. 2. By enabling large-scale data generation across diverse patient anatomies and challenging procedural scenarios, ROOM can facilitate the development of robot bronchoscopy without the constraints of clinical data collection. The primary contributions of this work are: ROOM, realistic simulation framework designed for continuum robot bronchoscopy to generate synthetic data at medically-relevant scales. photorealistic rendering pipeline that considers endoscopic lighting conditions, tissue surface properties, and data-driven sensor models. Validation of the synthetic data produced by ROOM in medically-relevant tasks, such as multi-view pose estimation and monocular depth estimation. Demonstration of additional applications such as monocular depth fine-tuning and visual navigation.

ROOM is a simulation framework that generates photorealistic bronchoscopy training data using patient CT scans, enabling the development and validation of autonomy algorithms in medical robotics.  					AI-generated summary 				 Continuum robots are advancing bronchoscopy procedures by accessing complex lung airways and enabling targeted interventions. However, their development is limited by the lack of realistic training and test environments: Real data is difficult to collect due to ethical constraints and patient safety concerns, and developing autonomy algorithms requires realistic imaging and physical feedback. We present ROOM (Realistic Optical Observation in Medicine), a comprehensive simulation framework designed for generating photorealistic bronchoscopy training data. By leveraging patient CT scans, our pipeline renders multi-modal sensor data including RGB images with realistic noise and light specularities, metric depth maps, surface normals, optical flow and point clouds at medically relevant scales. We validate the data generated by ROOM in two canonical tasks for medical robotics -- multi-view pose estimation and monocular depth estimation, demonstrating diverse challenges that state-of-the-art methods must overcome to transfer to these medical settings. Furthermore, we show that the data produced by ROOM can be used to fine-tune existing depth estimation models to overcome these challenges, also enabling other downstream applications such as navigation. We expect that ROOM will enable large-scale data generation across diverse patient anatomies and procedural scenarios that are challenging to capture in clinical settings.
