Our code is publicly available at https://github. com/OpenDCAI/SciReasoner. 1. Introduction With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), models such as GPT-O3 and agent systems built upon them have demonstrated remarkable deductive abilities on purely textual tasks (Achiam et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2025; Huang & Yang, 2025; Chai et al., 2025). Although Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have achieved encouraging results (Bai et al., 2025; Yao et al., 2024), multimodal reasoningintegrating visual and textual information to derive coherent conclusionsremains core challenge in artificial intelligence. Recent benchmarks, such as SeePhys, further reveal that even state-of-the-art systems frequently struggle to extract and integrate visual information effectively, signaling that true cross-modal reasoning remains elusive (Xiang et al., 2025), especially in contrast to the impressive progress observed in text-only reasoning, where *Equal contribution 1Peking University 2Zhongguancun Academy 3Beihang University.

The published Step 9 suffers from periodicity/support mismatch. We present pair-shift difference construction that coherently cancels all unknown offsets, produces an exact uniform CRT-coset state over ZP , and then uses the QFT to enforce the intended modular linear relation. The unitary is reversible, uses poly(log M2) gates, and preserves the algorithms asymptotics. Project Page: https://github.com/yifanzhang-pro/quantum-lattice. Let D, p1, . . . , pκ be odd, pairwise coprime, and set := κ (cid:89) η=1 pη, M2 := D2P. In the algorithm from [Chen, 2024], the state of the registers immediately before the contested Step 9 is ϕ8.f = (cid:88) α(j) (cid:12) (cid:12) 2D2j 1 (cid:12) (cid:12) 2D2j [2..n] + [2..n] mod M2 (cid:11), (1.1) jZ 2πi where α(j) = M2 1 = p2 pκ, = (b steps.1 Here, entries, with the constraint that that satisfies the modular linear relation (aj2+bj+c) is known quadratic phase arising from the preceding windowed-QFT n) Zn, and the offset vector Zn has unknown 1 = 0. The goal of Step 9 is to generate random vector Zn M2 1, . . . , b, 0 (mod ), (1.2) from which the hidden data is recovered by linear algebra (cf. Eq. (41) in Chen [2024]). 1The sum over is normalizable due to an implicit finite window from the windowed-QFT stage; global normalization factors are omitted as they do not affect our arguments. 1 The published version of Step 9 attempts domain extension on the first coordinate only. This approach, as noted by the original author, misuses amplitude periodicity and results in state with support of the incorrect size. Our contribution. Our contribution is replacement for Step 9 that uses pair-shift difference subroutine. This "

"A replacement for the domain-extension step in a quantum lattice algorithm uses a pair-shift difference construction to correct periodicity issues and enforce modular linear relations efficiently.  					AI-generated summary 				 We give a simple, fully correct, and assumption-light replacement for the contested "domain-extension" in Step 9 of a recent windowed-QFT lattice algorithm with complex-Gaussian windows~chen2024quantum. The published Step~9 suffers from a periodicity/support mismatch. We present a pair-shift difference construction that coherently cancels all unknown offsets, produces an exact uniform CRT-coset state over Z_{P}, and then uses the QFT to enforce the intended modular linear relation. The unitary is reversible, uses poly(log M_2) gates, and preserves the algorithm's asymptotics. Project Page: https://github.com/yifanzhang-pro/quantum-lattice."
