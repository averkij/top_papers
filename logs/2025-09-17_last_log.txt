[ 1 1 4 5 2 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r Nicholas Pipitone 1 Ghita Houir Alami 1 Advaith Avadhanam 1 Anton Kaminskyi 1 Ashley Khoo 1 1. Abstract We introduce novel training methodology named zELO, which optimizes retrieval performance via the analysis that ranking tasks are statically equivalent to Thurstone model. Based on the zELO method, we use unsupervised data in order train suite of state-of-the-art openweight reranker models: zerank-1 and zerank-1-small. These models achieve the highest retrieval scores in multiple domains, including finance, legal, code, and STEM, outperforming closed-source proprietary rerankers on both NDCG@10 and Recall. These models also demonstrate great versatility, maintaining their 0-shot performance on out-of-domain and private customer datasets. The training data included 112, 000 queries and 100 documents per query, and was trained end-to-end from unannotated queries and documents in less than 10,000 H100-hours. 2. Summary of Contributions 2.1. zELO: novel Elo-based multi-stage training pipeline We introduce novel multi-stage training process inspired by Elo scoring systems. First, we generate candidate documents using first-stage retriever (e.g. ZeroEntropys Search API, or Lucene + Embedding hybrid search). Then, we gather sparse pairwise preferences from an ensemble of large language models (and, for scale, pairwise SLM distilled from the ensemble of LLMs). These pairwise preferences are converted into absolute relevance scores using the Thurstone statistical model. Finally, we fine-tune our pointwise rerankers on these query-document zELO scores. 2.2. Open-source reranker models released We release two fully open-weight rerankers trained on the zELO Method: zerank-1, initialized from Qwen3-4B (Yang et al. 2025), and zerank-1-small, initialized from Qwen3-1.7B (Yang et al. 2025).

Open-source reranker models released We release two fully open-weight rerankers trained on the zELO Method: zerank-1, initialized from Qwen3-4B (Yang et al. 2025), and zerank-1-small, initialized from Qwen3-1.7B (Yang et al. 2025). Rerankers are crossencoder models that take query-document pair as input and output relevance score between 0 and 1, significantly boosting the performance of first-stage search methods such as BM25, embedding search, and hybrid retrieval. Both models were trained on 112,000 querycorpus pairs, i.e. over 5 million query-zELO pairs, and their weights are available on Huggingface. zerank-1-small in particular, is released under the permissible Apache 2.0 License. zerank-1 is open-weight and available for license by the ZeroEntropy team. zerank-1: zeroentropy/zerank-1 https://huggingface.co/ zerank-1-small: zeroentropy/zerank-1-small https://huggingface.co/ 2.3. State-of-the-art reranking accuracy across domains, languages, and retrieval methods zerank-1 consistently outperforms commercial rerankers twice its size, with NDCG improvements of up to 5 points on benchmarks in finance, medicine, legal, code, and math. It also outperforms much larger LLMs-as-a-reranker, such as Gemini Flash 2.0, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-5-mini/nano. It delivers strong gains regardless of the initial retrieval method, including BM25, embedding-based, and hybrid search. 2.4. Unsupervised training and fine-tuning Most importantly, at ZeroEntropy we found experimentally that ensembles of LLMs via zELO generate higher quality data than an equivalent number of human annotators on average. The zELO method has strong convergence properties. We scale ensemble inferences until the zELO score of the target document converges, which gives strong indicator of fundamental query-document relevancy. The entire annotation method has been open sourced by ZeroEntropy as zbench (https://github.com/zeroentropyai/zbench). zELO can be used both for benchmarking internal private documents, and for generating domain-specific fine-tuning data. Because zELO is fully automated, it can also be used for live production evaluations. While given reranker is used in production, live query logs can be randomly sampled, annotated automatically via zELO, and can be used to easily discover and fix issues in live production retrieval pipeline (For example: if necessary context was never ingested, or if the initial retriever couldnt find it, etc). The annotations can also be used to fine-tune the reranker live, or if given per-customer context, can be used for personal1 ized recommendation systems. 3. Motivation 3.1. Existing SOTA Rerankers are the most fundamental operation in information retrieval. They take in query document pair (q, d), and output score [0, 1]. If it was feasible, every query into search engine would simply have reranker do linear scan over the entire corpus. However, because this is computationally infeasible when the corpus is large, vectorbased approximators are used for selecting initial candidates. These include sparse lexical keyword search such as BM25 (Robertson et al. 1995), along with transformerbased embedding models. Keyword search fails if the user fails to recall the exact keyword, and dense embedding models cant converge on true relevancy because of the limitations of N-dimensional space (Weller et al., 2025). Given the fundamental importance of rerankers, we note that rerankers can always learn from an SFT distillation task. We have some teacher reranker, traditionally human-annotated binary relevance labels, and then student reranker, often an ML model, we can train the student on the teacher annotations. The current SOTA method for training rerankers involves InfoNCE triplet loss (q, d+, d). Humans (the teacher) are tasked with annotated the positive, while the sampling method for negatives remains free parameter. The most basic negative sampling strategy is in-batch random sampling (E.g. CLIP). However, the signal from random sampling is extremely weak, given that the sampled is usually obviously irrelevant; this method thus requires extremely large batch size (> 100k), which in turn forces the use of poor quality web-scale data. The SOTA training method is hard negative mining, wherein there is an attempt to make as relevant as possible to maximize the signal from contrastive learning often via an ensemble of embedding models followed by an ensemble of rerankers (Even LLM-as-a-reranker). 3.2. Laffer Curve: The Fundamental Constraint on Existing SOTA Hard Negative Mining Experimentally, we found that by making the hard negative miner as intelligent as possible, the Model eventually did not learn any better. In fact, we found that it got significantly worse. Manual inspection made the issue clear: The hard negatives were on"

[ 1 6 9 6 0 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r Struct-Bench: Benchmark for Differentially Private Structured Text Generation Shuaiqi Wang Carnegie Mellon University Vikas Raunak Microsoft Corporation shuaiqiw@andrew.cmu.edu viraunak@microsoft.com arturs.backurs@microsoft.com Pei Zhou Microsoft Corporation victorol@microsoft.com pei.zhou@microsoft.com sihaochen@microsoft.com Zinan Lin Microsoft Research Longqi.Yang@microsoft.com zinanlin@microsoft.com yekhanin@microsoft.com gfanti@andrew.cmu.edu Abstract Differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation is promising technique for utilizing private datasets that otherwise cannot be exposed for model training or other analytics. While much research literature has focused on generating private unstructured text and image data, in enterprise settings, structured data (e.g., tabular) is more common, often including natural language fields or components. Existing synthetic data evaluation techniques (e.g., FID) struggle to capture the structural properties and correlations of such datasets. In this work, we propose Struct-Bench, framework and benchmark for evaluating synthetic datasets derived from structured datasets that contain natural language data. The Struct-Bench framework requires users to provide representation of their dataset structure as Context-Free Grammar (CFG). Our benchmark comprises 5 real-world and 2 synthetically generated datasets, each annotated with CFGs. We show that these datasets demonstrably present great challenge even for state-of-the-art DP synthetic data generation methods. Struct-Bench also includes reference implementations of different metrics and leaderboard, thereby providing researchers standardized evaluation platform to benchmark and investigate privacy-preserving synthetic data generation methods. Further, we also present case study showing how to use Struct-Bench to improve the synthetic data quality of Private Evolution (PE) on structured data. The benchmark and the leaderboard ha"

A novel training methodology named zELO optimizes retrieval performance by treating ranking tasks as equivalent to a Thurstone model, resulting in state-of-the-art open-weight reranker models that outperform proprietary models across various domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce a novel training methodology named zELO, which optimizes retrieval performance via the analysis that ranking tasks are statically equivalent to a Thurstone model. Based on the zELO method, we use unsupervised data in order train a suite of state-of-the-art open-weight reranker models: zerank-1 and zerank-1-small. These models achieve the highest retrieval scores in multiple domains, including finance, legal, code, and STEM, outperforming closed-source proprietary rerankers on both NDCG@10 and Recall. These models also demonstrate great versatility, maintaining their 0-shot performance on out-of-domain and private customer datasets. The training data included 112,000 queries and 100 documents per query, and was trained end-to-end from unannotated queries and documents in less than 10,000 H100-hours.

Struct-Bench is a framework and benchmark for evaluating synthetic structured datasets with natural language components, addressing challenges in differentially private synthetic data generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation is a promising technique for utilizing private datasets that otherwise cannot be exposed for model training or other analytics. While much research literature has focused on generating private unstructured text and image data, in enterprise settings, structured data (e.g., tabular) is more common, often including natural language fields or components. Existing synthetic data evaluation techniques (e.g., FID) struggle to capture the structural properties and correlations of such datasets. In this work, we propose Struct-Bench, a framework and benchmark for evaluating synthetic datasets derived from structured datasets that contain natural language data. The Struct-Bench framework requires users to provide a representation of their dataset structure as a Context-Free Grammar (CFG). Our benchmark comprises 5 real-world and 2 synthetically generated datasets, each annotated with CFGs. We show that these datasets demonstrably present a great challenge even for state-of-the-art DP synthetic data generation methods. Struct-Bench also includes reference implementations of different metrics and a leaderboard, thereby providing researchers a standardized evaluation platform to benchmark and investigate privacy-preserving synthetic data generation methods. Further, we also present a case study showing how to use Struct-Bench to improve the synthetic data quality of Private Evolution (PE) on structured data. The benchmark and the leaderboard have been publicly made available at https://struct-bench.github.io.

"Struct-Bench is a framework and benchmark for evaluating synthetic structured datasets with natural language components, addressing challenges in differentially private synthetic data generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation is a promising technique for utilizing private datasets that otherwise cannot be exposed for model training or other analytics. While much research literature has focused on generating private unstructured text and image data, in enterprise settings, structured data (e.g., tabular) is more common, often including natural language fields or components. Existing synthetic data evaluation techniques (e.g., FID) struggle to capture the structural properties and correlations of such datasets. In this work, we propose Struct-Bench, a framework and benchmark for evaluating synthetic datasets derived from structured datasets that contain natural language data. The Struct-Bench framework requires users to provide a representation of their dataset structure as a Context-Free Grammar (CFG). Our benchmark comprises 5 real-world and 2 synthetically generated datasets, each annotated with CFGs. We show that these datasets demonstrably present a great challenge even for state-of-the-art DP synthetic data generation methods. Struct-Bench also includes reference implementations of different metrics and a leaderboard, thereby providing researchers a standardized evaluation platform to benchmark and investigate privacy-preserving synthetic data generation methods. Further, we also present a case study showing how to use Struct-Bench to improve the synthetic data quality of Private Evolution (PE) on structured data. The benchmark and the leaderboard have been publicly made available at https://struct-bench.github.io."
