Index TermsUnified multimodal models, Multimodal understanding, Image generation, Autoregressive model, Diffusion modelIn recent years, the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), such as LLaMa [1], [2], PanGu [3], [4], Qwen [5], [6], and GPT [7], has revolutionized artificial intelligence. These models have scaled up in both size and capability, enabling breakthroughs across diverse applications. Alongside this progress, LLMs have been extended into multimodal domains, giving rise to powerful multimodal understanding models like LLaVa [8], Qwen-VL [9], [10], InternVL [11], Ovis [12], and GPT4 [13]. These models have expanded their capabilities beyond simple image captioning to performing complex reasoning tasks based on user instructions. On the other hand, image generation technology has also experienced rapid development, with models like SD series [14], [15] and FLUX [16] now capable of producing high-quality images that adhere closely to user prompts. The predominant architectural paradigm for LLMs and multimodal understanding models is autoregressive generXinjie Zhang is with Alibaba Group and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Project leader: Qing-Guo Chen. ation [17], which relies on decoder-only structures and nexttoken prediction for sequential text generation. In contrast, the field of text-to-image generation has evolved along different trajectory. Initially dominated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [18], image generation has since transitioned to diffusion-based models [19], which leverage architectures like UNet [14] and DiT [20], [21] alongside advanced text encoders such as CLIP [22] and T5 [23]. Despite some explorations into using LLM-inspired architectures for image generation [24], [25], [26], diffusionbased approaches remain the state-of-the-art in terms of performance currently. While autoregressive models lag behind diffusion-based methods in image generation quality, their structural consistency with LLMs makes them particularly appealing for developing unified multimodal systems. unified model capable of both understanding and generating multimodal content holds immense potential: it could generate images based on complex instructions, reason about visual data, and visualize multimodal analyses through generated outputs. The unveiling of GPT-4os enhanced capabilities [27] in March 2025 has further highlighted this potential, sparking widespread interest in unification. However, designing such unified framework presents significant challenges. It requires integrating the strengths of autoregressive models for reasoning and text generation with the robustness of diffusion-based models for highquality image synthesis. Key questions remain unresolved, Fig. 1. Timeline of Publicly Available and Unavailable Unified Multimodal Models. The models are categorized by their release years, from 2023 to 2025. Models underlined in the diagram represent any-to-any multimodal models, capable of handling inputs or outputs beyond text and image, such as audio, video, and speech. The timeline highlights the rapid growth in this field. including how to tokenize images effectively for autoregressive generation. Some approaches [28], [29], [30] employ VAE [31] or VQ-GAN [32] commonly used in diffusionbased pipelines, or relevant variants, while others [33], [34], [35] utilize semantic encoders like EVA-CLIP [36] and OpenAI-CLIP [22]. Additionally, while discrete tokens are standard for text in autoregressive models, continuous representations may be more suitable for image tokens, as suggested by emerging research [25]. Beyond tokenization, hybrid architectures [37], [38], [39] that combine parallel diffusion strategies with sequential autoregressive generation offer another promising approach aside from naive autoregressive architecture. Thus, both image tokenization techniques and architectural designs remain in their nascent stages for unified multimodal models. To provide comprehensive overview of the current state of unified multimodal models (as illustrated in Fig. 1), thereby benefiting futur"

Our approach leverages carefully controlled scenes, in which single humanoid minifigure is paired with single object. By systematically varying spatial configurations such as object position relative to the humanoid minifigure and the humanoid minifigures orientation and using both birds-eye and surface-level views, we created 144 unique visual tasks. Each visual task is paired with series of 7 diagnostic questions designed to assess three levels of visual cognition: scene understanding, spatial reasoning, and visual perspective taking. Our evaluation of several state-ofthe-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, and variants of Claude Sonnet, reveals that while they excel in scene understanding, the performance declines significantly on spatial reasoning and further deteriorates on perspective-taking. Our analysis suggests gap between surface-level object recognition and the deeper spatial and perspective reasoning required for complex visual tasks, pointing to the need for integrating explicit geometric representations and tailored training protocols in future VLM development.

Recent years have seen remarkable progress in both multimodal understanding models and image generation models. Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data.

"Recent years have seen remarkable progress in both multimodal understanding models and image generation models. Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid advancements and will regularly update this survey. Our goal is to inspire further research and provide a valuable reference for the community. The references associated with this survey are available on GitHub (https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Awesome-Unified-Multimodal-Models)."

We investigate the ability of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform visual perspective taking using a novel set of visual tasks inspired by established human tests. Our approach leverages carefully controlled scenes, in which a single humanoid minifigure is paired with a single object. By systematically varying spatial configurations - such as object position relative to the humanoid minifigure and the humanoid minifigure's orientation - and using both bird's-eye and surface-level views, we created 144 unique visual tasks. Each visual task is paired with a series of 7 diagnostic questions designed to assess three levels of visual cognition: scene understanding, spatial reasoning, and visual perspective taking. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, and variants of Claude Sonnet, reveals that while they excel in scene understanding, the performance declines significantly on spatial reasoning and further deteriorates on perspective-taking. Our analysis suggests a gap between surface-level object recognition and the deeper spatial and perspective reasoning required for complex visual tasks, pointing to the need for integrating explicit geometric representations and tailored training protocols in future VLM development.
