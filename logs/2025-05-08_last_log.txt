[ 1 2 2 6 4 0 . 5 0 5 2 : r Fig. 1. 3D primitive assemblies created by PrimitiveAnything span diverse shape categories, enabling versatile primitive-based 3D content creation. Shape primitive abstraction, which decomposes complex 3D shapes into simple geometric elements, plays crucial role in human visual cognition and has broad applications in computer vision and graphics. While recent advances in 3D content generation have shown remarkable progress, existing primitive abstraction methods either rely on geometric optimization with limited semantic understanding or learn from small-scale, categoryspecific datasets, struggling to generalize across diverse shape categories. We present PrimitiveAnything, novel framework that reformulates shape primitive abstraction as primitive assembly generation task. PrimitiveAnything includes shape-conditioned primitive transformer for auto-regressive generation and an ambiguity-free parameterization scheme to represent multiple types of primitives in unified manner. The proposed framework directly learns the process of primitive assembly from large-scale human-crafted abstractions, enabling it to capture how humans decompose complex shapes into primitive elements. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PrimitiveAnything can generate high-quality primitive assemblies that better align with human perception while maintaining geometric fidelity across diverse shape categories. It benefits various 3D applications and Equal contributions. Corresponding authors.

With advancements in artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of tackling complex problems across diverse domains. Unlike traditional computational systems, LLMs combine raw computational power with an approximation of human reasoning, allowing them to generate solutions, make inferences, and even leverage external computational tools. However, applying LLMs to real-world problemsolving presents significant challenges, including multi-step reasoning, domain knowledge integration, and result verification. This survey explores the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in complex problem-solving, examining techniques including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, knowledge augmentation, and various LLM-based and tool-based verification techniques. Additionally, we highlight domain-specific challenges in various domains, such as software engineering, mathematical reasoning and proving, data analysis and modeling, and scientific research. The paper further discusses the fundamental limitations of the current LLM solutions and the future directions of LLM-based complex problems solving from the perspective of multi-step reasoning, domain knowledge integration and result verification.

[ 1 8 5 3 0 0 . 5 0 5 2 : r R&B: Domain Regrouping and Data Mixture Balancing for Efficient Foundation Model Training Albert Ge Tzu-Heng Huang University of Wisconsin-Madison {afge, thuang273, jfcooper2, astrost, zchu28, zcai75, sgnamburi}@wisc.edu {kendall, nick11roberts, fredsala}@cs.wisc.edu May 2, 2025 Abstract Data mixing strategies have successfully reduced the costs involved in training language models. While promising, such methods suffer from two flaws. First, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task types), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving performance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of domains in computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via R&B, framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity (Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data composition (Balance) by leveraging Gram matrix induced by domain gradients obtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for additional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or gradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and provide theoretical insights that justify R&Bs effectiveness compared to non-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of R&B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and multimodal tasks. With as little as 0.01% additional compute overhead, R&B matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art data mixing strategies. Large language models depend on vast, diverse datasets, but the shift to general-purpose foundation models has created fundamental imbalance: potential training data vastly exceeds available computational resources. This has driven the development of data-efficient strategies that maximize performance while minimizing compute costs. Among these approaches, data mixing is particularly prom"

Text:"5 2 0 2 7 ] . [ 1 2 1 5 4 0 . 5 0 5 2 : r HunyuanCustom: Multimodal-Driven Architecture for Customized Video Generation Tencent Hunyuan Figure 1: HunyuanCustom facilitates multi-modal driven video customization, allowing for the generation of videos based on text, images, audio, and video inputs. It supports wide range of applications, such as virtual human advertisements, virtual try-ons, singing avatars, and video editing, significantly enhancing the controllability of subject-centric video generation.Customized video generation aims to produce videos featuring specific subjects under flexible user-defined conditions, yet existing methods often struggle with identity consistency and limited input modalities. In this paper, we propose HunyuanCustom, multi-modal customized video generation framework that emphasizes subject consistency while supporting image, audio, video, and text conditions. Built upon HunyuanVideo, our model first addresses the image-text conditioned generation task by introducing text-image fusion module based on LLaVA for enhanced multi-modal understanding, along with an image ID enhancement module that leverages temporal concatenation to reinforce identity features across frames. To enable audioand video-conditioned generation, we further propose modality-specific condition injection mechanisms: an AudioNet module that achieves hierarchical alignment via spatial cross-attention, and video-driven injection module that integrates latent-compressed conditional video through patchify-based feature-alignment network. Extensive experiments on singleand multi-subject scenarios demonstrate that HunyuanCustom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art openand closed-source methods in terms of ID consistency, realism, and text-video alignment. Moreover, we validate its robustness across downstream tasks, including audio and video-driven customized video generation. Our results highlight the effectiveness of multi-modal conditioning and identitypreserving strategies in advancing controllable video generation. All the code and models are available at https://hunyuancustom.github.io.The field of video generation has undergone rapid advancement in recent years, driven by the proliferation of both open-source and commercial video-generation models. These advancements have significant real-world implications, ranging from content creation in the entertainment industry to applications in education, advertising, and more Xu et al. [2025], Hu et al. [2024], Zhou et al. [2024b], Pan et al. [2024], Huang et al. [2024b]. However, critical limitation persists: the lack of precise controllability in current models. Generating videos that adhere to users specific requirements is still challenging, which restricts their potential applications in real-world scenarios where fine-grained customization is essential. Controllable video generation often focuses on synthesizing videos featuring specific subjects, which is also known as customized video generation. Some existing methods such as, ConsisID [Yuan et al., 2024] and MovieGen [Polyak et al., 2025] specialize in generating videos for single human ID, they are unable to handle arbitrary objects. Other approaches, including ConceptMaster [Huang et al., 2025], Video Alchemist [Chen et al., 2025], Phantom [Liu et al., 2025], and SkyReels-A2 [Fei et al., 2025] extend this capability to multi-subject generation. Nevertheless, these methods struggle with maintaining subject consistency and video quality, and their reliance on single-modality (imagedriven) inputs restricts their broader applicability. Recently, VACE [Jiang et al., 2025], based on the Wan video generation model [Wang et al., 2025], introduces multi-modal-conditioned video generation framework. However, its excessive training tasks compromise ID consistency. Therefore, in this work we prioritize subject-consistent generation and develop multi-modal customized video generation model that robustly preserves subject consistency. Our model supports diverse inputs, including image identities, audio conditions, video backgrounds, and text prompts, enabling multi-modal subject-consistent video generation. In this work, we propose HunyuanCustom, video generation model built upon HunyuanVideo which specializes in subject-consistent generation conditioned on images, videos, audio, and text. Specifically, our model first generates videos that align with given image indentity under text-driven condition. We propose text-image fusion module based on LLaVA, enabling interactive integration of text and images to enhance the models understanding of both modalities. Additionally, we propose an image ID enhancement module that leverages temporal concatenation of image information across video frames. By exploiting the video models inherent efficiency in time-series information transmission, this module effectively strengthens video ID-consistency. Based on the subject-consistent customized video generation framework, HunyuanCustom extends its capabilities to audio and video modalities, enabling audio-driven customized video generation and video-driven customized video generation. To decouple the audio, video, and image modalities, HunyuanCustom employs distinct condition injection mechanisms for audio and video, ensuring independence from the image-level identity injection module. For audio-driven video customization, we propose AudioNet, which extracts multi-level deep audio features and injects them into corresponding video features via spatial cross-attention, achieving hierarchical audio-video alignment. For video-driven video customization, HunyuanCustom proposes an alignment and fusion module between conditional video and latent representations. By compressing the given video into the latent space through VAE, we project the video into the same space as the noisy latents. To compensate for the feature differences between clear video features and noisy latents, we design video patchify module for video-latent feature alignment. Then, new identity-disentangled video conditioning module is introduced to ensure seamless integration, enabling efficient video feature injection into the latent space. HunyuanCustom has been rigorously evaluated on single-subject consistency and multi-subject consistency generation. We compared it with existing open-source methods and closed-source commercial software, conducting comprehensive comparisons across key metrics such as ID consistency, generation q"

As a seemingly self-explanatory task, problem-solving has been a significant component of science and engineering. However, a general yet concrete formulation of problem-solving itself is missing. With the recent development of AI-based problem-solving agents, the demand for process-level verifiability is rapidly increasing yet underexplored. To fill these gaps, we present a principled formulation of problem-solving as a deterministic Markov decision process; a novel framework, FPS (Formal Problem-Solving), which utilizes existing FTP (formal theorem proving) environments to perform process-verified problem-solving; and D-FPS (Deductive FPS), decoupling solving and answer verification for better human-alignment.

Shape primitive abstraction, which decomposes complex 3D shapes into simple geometric elements, plays a crucial role in human visual cognition and has broad applications in computer vision and graphics. While recent advances in 3D content generation have shown remarkable progress, existing primitive abstraction methods either rely on geometric optimization with limited semantic understanding or learn from small-scale, category-specific datasets, struggling to generalize across diverse shape categories. We present PrimitiveAnything, a novel framework that reformulates shape primitive abstraction as a primitive assembly generation task. PrimitiveAnything includes a shape-conditioned primitive transformer for auto-regressive generation and an ambiguity-free parameterization scheme to represent multiple types of primitives in a unified manner. The proposed framework directly learns the process of primitive assembly from large-scale human-crafted abstractions, enabling it to capture how humans decompose complex shapes into primitive elements. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PrimitiveAnything can generate high-quality primitive assemblies that better align with human perception while maintaining geometric fidelity across diverse shape categories. It benefits various 3D applications and shows potential for enabling primitive-based user-generated content (UGC) in games. Project page: https://primitiveanything.github.io

Problem-solving has been a fundamental driver of human progress in numerous domains. With advancements in artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of tackling complex problems across diverse domains. Unlike traditional computational systems, LLMs combine raw computational power with an approximation of human reasoning, allowing them to generate solutions, make inferences, and even leverage external computational tools. However, applying LLMs to real-world problem-solving presents significant challenges, including multi-step reasoning, domain knowledge integration, and result verification. This survey explores the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in complex problem-solving, examining techniques including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, knowledge augmentation, and various LLM-based and tool-based verification techniques. Additionally, we highlight domain-specific challenges in various domains, such as software engineering, mathematical reasoning and proving, data analysis and modeling, and scientific research. The paper further discusses the fundamental limitations of the current LLM solutions and the future directions of LLM-based complex problems solving from the perspective of multi-step reasoning, domain knowledge integration and result verification.

"Problem-solving has been a fundamental driver of human progress in numerous domains. With advancements in artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of tackling complex problems across diverse domains. Unlike traditional computational systems, LLMs combine raw computational power with an approximation of human reasoning, allowing them to generate solutions, make inferences, and even leverage external computational tools. However, applying LLMs to real-world problem-solving presents significant challenges, including multi-step reasoning, domain knowledge integration, and result verification. This survey explores the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in complex problem-solving, examining techniques including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, knowledge augmentation, and various LLM-based and tool-based verification techniques. Additionally, we highlight domain-specific challenges in various domains, such as software engineering, mathematical reasoning and proving, data analysis and modeling, and scientific research. The paper further discusses the fundamental limitations of the current LLM solutions and the future directions of LLM-based complex problems solving from the perspective of multi-step reasoning, domain knowledge integration and result verification."

Data mixing strategies have successfully reduced the costs involved in training language models. While promising, such methods suffer from two flaws. First, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task types), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving performance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of domains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via R&B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity (Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data composition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients obtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for additional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or gradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and provide theoretical insights that justify R&B's effectiveness compared to non-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of R&B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and multimodal tasks. With as little as 0.01% additional compute overhead, R&B matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art data mixing strategies.

Customized video generation aims to produce videos featuring specific subjects under flexible user-defined conditions, yet existing methods often struggle with identity consistency and limited input modalities. In this paper, we propose HunyuanCustom, a multi-modal customized video generation framework that emphasizes subject consistency while supporting image, audio, video, and text conditions. Built upon HunyuanVideo, our model first addresses the image-text conditioned generation task by introducing a text-image fusion module based on LLaVA for enhanced multi-modal understanding, along with an image ID enhancement module that leverages temporal concatenation to reinforce identity features across frames. To enable audio- and video-conditioned generation, we further propose modality-specific condition injection mechanisms: an AudioNet module that achieves hierarchical alignment via spatial cross-attention, and a video-driven injection module that integrates latent-compressed conditional video through a patchify-based feature-alignment network. Extensive experiments on single- and multi-subject scenarios demonstrate that HunyuanCustom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open- and closed-source methods in terms of ID consistency, realism, and text-video alignment. Moreover, we validate its robustness across downstream tasks, including audio and video-driven customized video generation. Our results highlight the effectiveness of multi-modal conditioning and identity-preserving strategies in advancing controllable video generation.
