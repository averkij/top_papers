[09.02.2025 12:37] Abstract 10. Large language models (LLMs), such as o1 from OpenAI, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities. o1 generates a long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) before answering a question. LongCoT allows LLMs to analyze problems, devise plans, reflect, and backtrack effectively. These actions empower LLM ...

We introduce a new approach to systematically map features discovered by sparse autoencoder across consecutive layers of large language models, extending earlier work that examined inter-layer feature links. By using a data-free cosine similarity technique, we trace how specific features persist, transform, or first appear at each stage. This method yields granular flow graphs of feature evolution, enabling fine-grained interpretability and mechanistic insights into model computations. Crucially, we demonstrate how these cross-layer feature maps facilitate direct steering of model behavior by amplifying or suppressing chosen features, achieving targeted thematic control in text generation. Together, our findings highlight the utility of a causal, cross-layer interpretability framework that not only clarifies how features develop through forward passes but also provides new means for transparent manipulation of large language models.

我们介绍了一种新方法，系统地映射稀疏自编码器在大语言模型的连续层中发现的特征。我们使用无数据余弦相似度技术，追踪特定特征在每个阶段的持续、转变或首次出现。该方法产生特征演变的细粒度流图，提供细粒度的可解释性和机制洞察。关键是，我们展示了这些跨层特征图如何通过放大或抑制选定特征，直接引导模型行为，实现文本生成的定向主题控制。总的来说，我们的发现突显了因果、跨层可解释性框架的实用性，不仅澄清了特征通过前向传递的发展，还提供了透明操作大语言模型的新方法。
