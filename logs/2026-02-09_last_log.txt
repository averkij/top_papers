Training diffusion models on neural network activations creates meta-models that learn internal state distributions and improve intervention fidelity without restrictive structural assumptions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing approaches for analyzing neural network activations, such as PCA and sparse autoencoders, rely on strong structural assumptions. Generative models offer an alternative: they can uncover structure without such assumptions and act as priors that improve intervention fidelity. We explore this direction by training diffusion models on one billion residual stream activations, creating "meta-models" that learn the distribution of a network's internal states. We find that diffusion loss decreases smoothly with compute and reliably predicts downstream utility. In particular, applying the meta-model's learned prior to steering interventions improves fluency, with larger gains as loss decreases. Moreover, the meta-model's neurons increasingly isolate concepts into individual units, with sparse probing scores that scale as loss decreases. These results suggest generative meta-models offer a scalable path toward interpretability without restrictive structural assumptions. Project page: https://generative-latent-prior.github.io.

  "desc": "В работе предлагается использовать диффузионные модели для обучения на активациях нейронных сетей, создавая мета-модели, которые изучают распределение внутренних состояний сети. Авторы обучили диффузионную модель на миллиарде активаций остаточного потока и показали, что потери модели уменьшаются плавно с увеличением вычислительных ресурсов. Применение приоритета, полученного мета-моделью, к interventions улучшает качество генерируемого текста, а нейроны мета-модели всё лучше изолируют отдельные концепции в отдельные единицы. Этот подход предлагает масштабируемый путь к интерпретируемости нейронных сетей без ограничивающих структурных предположений.",
