[ 1 4 2 7 6 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Table-as-Search: Formulate Long-Horizon Agentic Information Seeking as Table Completion Tian Lan, Felix Henry, Bin Zhu, Qianghuai Jia, Junyang Ren Qihang Pu, Haijun Li, Longyue Wang*, Zhao Xu, Weihua LuoCurrent Information Seeking (InfoSeeking) agents struggle to maintain focus and coherence during long-horizon exploration, as tracking search states, including planning procedure and massive search results, within one plaintext context is inherently fragile. To address this, we introduce Table-as-Search (TaS), structured planning framework that reformulates the InfoSeeking task as Table Completion task. TaS maps each query into structured table schema maintained in an external database, where rows represent search candidates and columns denote constraints or required information. This table precisely manages the search states: filled cells strictly record the history and search results, while empty cells serve as an explicit search plan. Crucially, TaS unifies three distinct InfoSeeking tasks: Deep Search, Wide Search, and the challenging DeepWide Search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TaS significantly outperforms numerous state-of-the-art baselines across three kinds of benchmarks, including multi-agent framework and commercial systems. Furthermore, our analysis validates the TaSs superior robustness in long-horizon InfoSeeking, alongside its efficiency, scalability and flexibility. Code and datasets are publicly released at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/ Marco-Search-Agent.Information retrieval is undergoing paradigm shift from simple fact retrieval to complex longhorizon Agentic InfoSeeking (Li et al., 2025b; Team et al., 2025c; Li et al., 2025a; Yao et al., 2022). It necessitates agents to navigate massive web environments and synthesize answers through multi-step reasoning (Li et al., 2025b; Team et al., 2025c; Li et al., 2025a). Mastering this capability * Corresponding author: wanglongyue.wly@alibabainc.com 1 is central to next-generation Deep Research Systems (Google, 2025; Team et al., 2025c). While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as the dominant solution for this task (Team et al., 2025c,b), current paradigms, such as ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), rely heavily on unstructured plain text to manage the search states, including planning procedure and massive search results, which is inherently fragile. Although recent advancements in context management (Wu et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025b) and procedural planning (Prasad et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2025) attempt to mitigate this overhead, they still burden the finite unstructured agent context with tracking massive search states of long-horizon InfoSeeking. Consequently, as the horizon expands, these methods expose agents to the "lost in the middle" (Zhang et al., 2024) phenomenon, leading to error propagation and ineffective exploration (Chen et al., 2025; Tao et al., 2025). For instance, tracking thousands of search results and corresponding planning process in WideSearch (Wong et al., 2025) within single plain-text trajectory inevitably leads to severe hallucinations and loss of state fidelity. To address this, we introduce Table-as-Search (TaS), structured planning framework that reformulates the InfoSeeking as Table Completion task. As illustrated in Figure 1, rather than treating InfoSeeking as unstructured text generation, TaS explicitly maps the user query into structured schema where rows represent candidate entities and columns denote specific constraints or required information. This table precisely manages the search states: filled cells represent the search history and results, while empty cells serve as pending actions (i.e., explicit search plan). Moreover, by offloading the massive search results to an external database, TaS alleviates the agents memory burden, preserving the valuable context window for complex reasoning. Specifically, we implement TaS via multiagent system centered around shared database Figure 1: The overview of TaS Framework. Left: Unstructured planning (e.g., ReAct) is fragile and prone to massive context. Center: TaS reformulates InfoSeeking as Table Completion via row expansion and cell population. Right: TaS provides unified representation for conducting Deep Search, Wide Search and DeepWide Search. table. central planner orchestrates sub-agents to iteratively expand rows for candidate discovery and populate cells for constraints verification or information collection. TaS provides unified representation for three distinct long-horizon InfoSeeking paradigms: (1) Deep Search: precise target filtering (Wei et al., 2025); (2) Wide Search: broad information aggregation (Wong et al., 2025); and (3) the challenging DeepWide Search (Parallel AI Team, 2025): broad exploration and deep verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TaS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (Yao et al., 2022; Wong et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025) across these three kinds of benchmarks. For example, on benchmarks demanding massive search (WideSearch and DeepWide), TaS instantiated with the Claude-Sonnet-4 (No Think) significantly outperforms both the computation-heavy MultiAgent baseline (Claude-Sonnet-4 (Thinking)) and the commercial Gemini DeepResearch system. Analysis further highlights TaSs superior robustness as InfoSeeking task complexity increases, alongside its efficiency (higher performance with comparable or lower search volume), scalability (effective test-time scaling), and flexibility (seamless integration of specialized deep search agents).Agentic Information Seeking. Recent research categorizes agentic information seeking into three paradigms (Lan et al., 2025): Deep Search (multi-step reasoning for single targets) (Mialon et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025), Wide Search (broad aggregation across extensive sources) (Wong et al., 2025; He et al., 2025), and the hybrid DeepWide Search (Parallel AI Team, 2025). While benchmarks exist for the former two (e.g., BrowseComp (Wei et al., 2025), WideSearch (Wong et al., 2025)), the community lacks public high-quality evaluations for DeepWide InfoSeeking. Addressing this gap, we curate challenging E-commerce Business Development (BD) benchmark, explicitly designed to stress-test agents in real-world DeepWide InfoSeeking. Agent Frameworks. The ReAct paradigm (Yao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2025) serves as the cornerstone of current agentic systems. While recent wo"

Table-as-Search framework reformulates information seeking tasks as table completion problems, improving long-horizon search robustness through structured state management.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current Information Seeking (InfoSeeking) agents struggle to maintain focus and coherence during long-horizon exploration, as tracking search states, including planning procedure and massive search results, within one plain-text context is inherently fragile. To address this, we introduce Table-as-Search (TaS), a structured planning framework that reformulates the InfoSeeking task as a Table Completion task. TaS maps each query into a structured table schema maintained in an external database, where rows represent search candidates and columns denote constraints or required information. This table precisely manages the search states: filled cells strictly record the history and search results, while empty cells serve as an explicit search plan. Crucially, TaS unifies three distinct InfoSeeking tasks: Deep Search, Wide Search, and the challenging DeepWide Search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TaS significantly outperforms numerous state-of-the-art baselines across three kinds of benchmarks, including multi-agent framework and commercial systems. Furthermore, our analysis validates the TaS's superior robustness in long-horizon InfoSeeking, alongside its efficiency, scalability and flexibility.
