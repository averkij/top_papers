Text:"Vision Transformer Finetuning Benefits from Non-Smooth Components Ambroise Odonnat 1 2 Laetitia Chapel 3 Romain Tavenard 4 Ievgen Redko 1 6 2 0 F 6 ] . [ 1 3 8 8 6 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract The smoothness of the transformer architecture has been extensively studied in the context of generalization, training stability, and adversarial robustness. However, its role in transfer learning remains poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the ability of vision transformer components to adapt their outputs to changes in inputs, or, in other words, their plasticity. Defined as an average rate of change, it captures the sensitivity to input perturbation; in particular, high plasticity implies low smoothness. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments that this perspective provides principled guidance in choosing the components to prioritize during adaptation. key takeaway for practitioners is that the high plasticity of the attention modules and feedforward layers consistently leads to better finetuning performance. Our findings depart from the prevailing assumption that smoothness is desirable, offering novel perspective on the functional properties of transformers. vit-plasticity 1. Introduction Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have become the default backbone of state-of-the-art models in wide range of domains, including natural language processing (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023), computer vision (Caron et al., 2021; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), time series forecasting (Ilbert et al., 2024; Nie et al., 2023), and mathematical reasoning (Comanici et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025). These foundation models are typically pretrained on large amounts of diverse data and then adapted to more specific domains (Shukor et al., 2025). In practice, the discrepancy between the training and downstream data can hurt performance (Quionero-Candela et al., 2009) and requires updating the model weights to adapt to the distribution shift. 1Noahs Ark"

RLVR methods using group sampling suffer from bias toward likely trajectories and missed rare-correct ones; a difficulty-aware advantage scaling technique improves performance on benchmarks without increasing computational cost.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is commonly based on group sampling to estimate advantages and stabilize policy updates. In practice, large group sizes are not feasible due to computational limits, which biases learning toward trajectories that are already likely. Smaller groups often miss rare-correct trajectories while still containing mixed rewards, concentrating probability on common solutions. We derive the probability that updates miss rare-correct modes as a function of group size, showing non-monotonic behavior, and characterize how updates redistribute mass within the correct set, revealing that unsampled-correct mass can shrink even as total correct mass grows. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a difficulty-aware advantage scaling coefficient, inspired by Focal loss, that down-weights updates on high-success prompts. The lightweight modification can be directly integrated into any group-relative RLVR algorithm such as GRPO, DAPO, and CISPO. On Qwen2.5-7B across in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, our method improves pass@256 from 64.1 rightarrow 70.3 (GRPO), 69.3 rightarrow 72.5 (DAPO), and 73.2 rightarrow 76.8 (CISPO), while preserving or improving pass@1, without increasing group size or computational cost.

Seg-ReSearch introduces a novel segmentation approach that combines interleaved reasoning with external search to overcome limitations of frozen MLLM knowledge, using hierarchical reward design for training and demonstrating superior performance on video object segmentation benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Segmentation based on language has been a popular topic in computer vision. While recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have endowed segmentation systems with reasoning capabilities, these efforts remain confined by the frozen internal knowledge of MLLMs, which limits their potential for real-world scenarios that involve up-to-date information or domain-specific concepts. In this work, we propose Seg-ReSearch, a novel segmentation paradigm that overcomes the knowledge bottleneck of existing approaches. By enabling interleaved reasoning and external search, Seg-ReSearch empowers segmentation systems to handle dynamic, open-world queries that extend beyond the frozen knowledge of MLLMs. To effectively train this capability, we introduce a hierarchical reward design that harmonizes initial guidance with progressive incentives, mitigating the dilemma between sparse outcome signals and rigid step-wise supervision. For evaluation, we construct OK-VOS, a challenging benchmark that explicitly requires outside knowledge for video object segmentation. Experiments on OK-VOS and two existing reasoning segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our Seg-ReSearch improves state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/Seg-ReSearch.

Vision transformer components exhibit varying plasticity levels that correlate with finetuning performance, challenging the assumption that smoothness is always beneficial.  					AI-generated summary 				 The smoothness of the transformer architecture has been extensively studied in the context of generalization, training stability, and adversarial robustness. However, its role in transfer learning remains poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the ability of vision transformer components to adapt their outputs to changes in inputs, or, in other words, their plasticity. Defined as an average rate of change, it captures the sensitivity to input perturbation; in particular, a high plasticity implies low smoothness. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments that this perspective provides principled guidance in choosing the components to prioritize during adaptation. A key takeaway for practitioners is that the high plasticity of the attention modules and feedforward layers consistently leads to better finetuning performance. Our findings depart from the prevailing assumption that smoothness is desirable, offering a novel perspective on the functional properties of transformers. The code is available at https://github.com/ambroiseodt/vit-plasticity.

Пластичность определяется как средняя скорость изменения и отражает чувствительность к возмущениям входа. Авторы показывают через теоретический анализ и эксперименты, что высокая пластичность модулей внимания и слоёв прямого распространения последовательно приводит к лучшей производительности при дообучении. Результаты противоречат общепринятому предположению о желательности гладкости функций в трансформерах, предлагая новый взгляд на их функциональные свойства.",
