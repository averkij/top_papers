In this paper, we propose OmniVideo-R1, novel reinforced framework that improves mixedOmniVideo-R1 empowmodality reasoning. ers models to think with omnimodal cues by two key strategies: (1) query-intensive grounding based on self-supervised learning paradigms; and (2) modality-attentive fusion built upon contrastive learning paradigms. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OmniVideo-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and robust generalization capabilities. 1. Introduction Human cognition is inherently multimodal; we perceive the physical world by processing visual and auditory signals in parallel, integrating them to construct coherent understanding of complex environments (Zhou et al., 2025c; Benchekroun et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2025c; Chen et al., 2024b; Lu et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025a). As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), the ability to interpret such multisensory inputs has become cornerstone of artificial general intelligence (Yu et al., 2025b;c; Cai et al., 2025; Li et al., 2024a; 2025c). However, contrary to the expectation that more modalities yield better understanding, current omnimodal models often exhibit paradoxical behavior. The work was conducted during the internship of Zhangquan Chen (czq23@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) at Tencent HY. 1THU 2Tencent HY 3HNU 4NUS 5XJTU 6CUHK. Correspondence to: Ruqi Huang <ruqihuang@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn>, Jiale Tao <jialetao.std@gmail.com>. Preprint. February 6, 2026. Figure 1. Pre-trained MLLMs (e.g., Qwen3-Omni) often exhibit suboptimal performance in audio-visual reasoning tasks due to inherent modality bias. To address this limitation, we reinforce the audio-visual reasoning ability by leveraging query intention and modality attention. This phenomenon is also evident in the state-of-the-art models. As shown in Fig. 1, pre-training inherently involves trade-offs across heterogeneous tasks, which can induce natural modality bias. Consequently, within the Qwen330B-A3B family, the Omni variant (Xu et al., 2025c) (audiovisual) substantially underperforms the VL variant (Bai et al., 2025a) (visual-only), dropping from 72.1 to 68.5 on MMStar (Chen et al., 2024a) and from 80.1 to 75.9 on MathVista_mini (Lu et al., 2023). These results expose key limitation of current paradigms: instead of enabling synergistic fusion, incorporating the audio modality can undermine the models established visual reasoning capability. natural response is to increase mixed audio-visual supervision during pre-training; however, scaling high-quality mixed-modality data and aligning it with downstream reasoning needs is non-trivial. On the other hand, existing post-training pipelines commonly rely on supervised finetuning (SFT) or vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) (e.g., GRPO) (Zhao et al., 2025b; Xing et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025b; Zhang et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2024). Yet these post-training methods do not explicitly train audio-visual mixed-modality reasoning behaviors, such as locating and composing evidence across modalities. That is, they provide OmniVideo-R1 little supervision over intermediate evidence-tracking. As result, the model may ignore decisive audio or visual cues and still produce the correct answer by exploiting dataset biases or unimodal shortcuts. To address this challenge, we present OmniVideo-R1, the first post-training framework designed to improve mixedmodality reasoning. We posit that solving such problem requires more than just balancing datasets; it requires instilling robust reasoning behaviors that allow the model to actively select and fuse information. Specifically, OmniVideo-R1 optimizes two fundamental capabilities: (1) query-intensive grounding and (2) modality-attentive fusion built upon query-intensive reasoning. Inspired by the think with images paradigm (OpenAI, 2025), we first introduce query-intensive grounding, which enables the model to explicitly localize and reason over audio-visual segments relevant to the users query before generating response. Since the grounding annotations conditioned on query intent are costly to obtain, we design self-supervised training scheme that leverages multiple timecaption pairs. This design allows the model to generate grounding hypotheses and validate them against the corresponding textual descriptions. For learning robust query intention behavior, we then propose modality-attentive fusion, which maximize the utilization of audio-visual cues. To achieve this, we design contrastive learning-based strategy that explicitly encourages the model to derive higher confidence from mixed audio-visual inputs compared to single-modality counterparts. This forces the model to discover synergistic relationships between visual and audio events, ensuring that the fused representation is strictly superior to its constituent parts. By combining these strategies into unified RL framework, OmniVideo-R1 turns mixed-modality understanding into query-driven reasoning process with audio-visual cues. Our primary contributions are summarized as follows: We propose OmniVideo-R1, the first RL-based framework designed to improve mixed-modality reasoning. We construct high-quality corpus of 80K audiovisual training samples through dedicated datacleaning pipeline, specifically curated to support complex reasoning tasks. We introduce two-stage RL paradigm that incorporates self-supervised grounding and contrastive fusion, enabling the model to learn query intention and modality attention without relying on process-level annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniVideo-R1 consistently outperforms strong open-source baselines on audio-visual benchmarks while effectively maintaining robust visual-only performance. 2.

Text:"ReMiT ReMiT: RL-Guided Mid-Training for Iterative LLM Evolution Junjie Huang1, Jiarui Qin2, Di Yin2, Weiwen Liu1, Yong Yu1, Xing Sun2, Weinan Zhang1 1Shanghai Jiao Tong University 2Tencent Youtu Lab Standard training pipelines for large language models (LLMs) are typically unidirectional, progressing from pre-training to post-training. However, the potential for bidirectional processwhere insights from post-training retroactively improve the pre-trained foundationremains unexplored. We aim to establish self-reinforcing flywheel: cycle in which reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned model strengthens the base model, which in turn enhances subsequent post-training performance, requiring no specially trained teacher or reference model. To realize this, we analyze training dynamics and identify the mid-training (annealing) phase as critical turning point for model capabilities. This phase typically occurs at the end of pre-training, utilizing high-quality corpora under rapidly decaying learning rate. Building upon this insight, we introduce ReMiT (Reinforcement LearningGuided Mid-Training). Specifically, ReMiT leverages the reasoning priors of RL-tuned models to dynamically reweight tokens during the mid-training phase, prioritizing those pivotal for reasoning. Empirically, ReMiT achieves an average improvement of 3% on 10 pre-training benchmarks, spanning math, code, and general reasoning, and sustains these gains by over 2% throughout the post-training pipeline. These results validate an iterative feedback loop, enabling continuous and self-reinforcing evolution of LLMs. 6 2 0 F 3 ] . [ 1 5 7 0 3 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Figure 1.

OmniVideo-R1 enhances audio-visual understanding through reinforced frameworks that integrate self-supervised and contrastive learning for multimodal reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 While humans perceive the world through diverse modalities that operate synergistically to support a holistic understanding of their surroundings, existing omnivideo models still face substantial challenges on audio-visual understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose OmniVideo-R1, a novel reinforced framework that improves mixed-modality reasoning.

SEAD framework enables service dialogue agents to learn effective strategies through self-evolving user modeling components, achieving superior task completion and dialogue efficiency compared to existing foundation and commercial models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in open-domain dialogues. However, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in service dialogues, as they rely on noisy, low-quality human conversation data. This limitation arises from data scarcity and the difficulty of simulating authentic, goal-oriented user behaviors. To address these issues, we propose SEAD (Self-Evolving Agent for Service Dialogue), a framework that enables agents to learn effective strategies without large-scale human annotations. SEAD decouples user modeling into two components: a Profile Controller that generates diverse user states to manage training curriculum, and a User Role-play Model that focuses on realistic role-playing. This design ensures the environment provides adaptive training scenarios rather than acting as an unfair adversary. Experiments demonstrate that SEAD significantly outperforms Open-source Foundation Models and Closed-source Commercial Models, improving task completion rate by 17.6% and dialogue efficiency by 11.1%.

ReMiT introduces a bidirectional training approach where reinforcement learning-guided mid-training token reweighting improves large language model pre-training and post-training performance through an iterative feedback loop.  					AI-generated summary 				 Standard training pipelines for large language models (LLMs) are typically unidirectional, progressing from pre-training to post-training. However, the potential for a bidirectional process--where insights from post-training retroactively improve the pre-trained foundation--remains unexplored. We aim to establish a self-reinforcing flywheel: a cycle in which reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned model strengthens the base model, which in turn enhances subsequent post-training performance, requiring no specially trained teacher or reference model. To realize this, we analyze training dynamics and identify the mid-training (annealing) phase as a critical turning point for model capabilities. This phase typically occurs at the end of pre-training, utilizing high-quality corpora under a rapidly decaying learning rate. Building upon this insight, we introduce ReMiT (Reinforcement Learning-Guided Mid-Training). Specifically, ReMiT leverages the reasoning priors of RL-tuned models to dynamically reweight tokens during the mid-training phase, prioritizing those pivotal for reasoning. Empirically, ReMiT achieves an average improvement of 3\% on 10 pre-training benchmarks, spanning math, code, and general reasoning, and sustains these gains by over 2\% throughout the post-training pipeline. These results validate an iterative feedback loop, enabling continuous and self-reinforcing evolution of LLMs.
