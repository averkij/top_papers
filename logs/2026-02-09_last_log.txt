Text:"6 2 0 2 6 ] . [ 1 9 6 6 6 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r compar:IA: The French Governments LLM arena to collect French-language human prompts and preference data Lucie Termignon Simonas Zilinskas Hadrien Pélissier Aurélien Barrot Nicolas Chesnais Elie Gavoty contact@comparia.beta.gouv.fr Abstract Large Language Models (LLMs) often show reduced performance, cultural alignment, and safety robustness in non-English languages, partly because English dominates both pre-training data and human preference alignment datasets. Training methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) require human preference data, which remains scarce and largely non-public for many languages beyond English. To address this gap, we introduce compar:IA, an open-source digital public service developed inside the French government and designed to collect large-scale human preference data from predominantly French-speaking general audience. The platform uses blind pairwise comparison interface to capture unconstrained, real-world prompts and user judgments across diverse set of language models, while maintaining low participation friction and privacy-preserving automated filtering. As of 2026-02-07, compar:IA has collected over 600,000 free-form prompts and 250,000 preference votes, with approximately 89% of the data in French (platform analytics; snapshot 2026-02-07). We release three complementary datasetsconversations, votes, and reactions under open licenses, and present initial analyses, including French-language model leaderboard and user interaction patterns. Beyond the French context, compar:IA is evolving toward an international digital public good, offering reusable infrastructure for multilingual model training, evaluation, and the study of humanAI interaction. Large language models (LLMs) are overwhelmingly trained on English-language data. Publicly available training disclosures for major open models show that French typically represents very "

Compar:IA is an open-source platform that collects large-scale human preference data for multilingual language model training and evaluation, featuring a blind pairwise comparison interface and releasing three datasets under open licenses.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) often show reduced performance, cultural alignment, and safety robustness in non-English languages, partly because English dominates both pre-training data and human preference alignment datasets. Training methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) require human preference data, which remains scarce and largely non-public for many languages beyond English. To address this gap, we introduce compar:IA, an open-source digital public service developed inside the French government and designed to collect large-scale human preference data from a predominantly French-speaking general audience. The platform uses a blind pairwise comparison interface to capture unconstrained, real-world prompts and user judgments across a diverse set of language models, while maintaining low participation friction and privacy-preserving automated filtering. As of 2026-02-07, compar:IA has collected over 600,000 free-form prompts and 250,000 preference votes, with approximately 89% of the data in French. We release three complementary datasets -- conversations, votes, and reactions -- under open licenses, and present initial analyses, including a French-language model leaderboard and user interaction patterns. Beyond the French context, compar:IA is evolving toward an international digital public good, offering reusable infrastructure for multilingual model training, evaluation, and the study of human-AI interaction.
