Text:"On the Entropy Dynamics in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models Shumin Wang 1 Yuexiang Xie 2 Wenhao Zhang 2 Yuchang Sun 2 Yanxi Chen 2 Yaliang Li 2 Yanyong ZhangEntropy serves as critical metric for measuring the diversity of outputs generated by large language models (LLMs), providing valuable insights into their exploration capabilities. While recent studies increasingly focus on monitoring and adjusting entropy to better balance exploration and exploitation in reinforcement finetuning (RFT), principled understanding of entropy dynamics during this process is yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we establish theoretical framework for analyzing the entropy dynamics during the RFT process, which begins with discriminant expression that quantifies entropy change under single logit update. This foundation enables the derivation of firstorder expression for entropy change, which can be further extended to the update formula of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The corollaries and insights drawn from the theoretical analysis inspire the design of entropy control methods, and also offer unified lens for interpreting various entropy-based methods in existing studies. We provide empirical evidence to support the main conclusions of our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived entropydiscriminator clipping methods. This study yields novel insights into RFT training dynamics, providing theoretical support and practical strategies for optimizing the exploration-exploitation balance during LLM fine-tuning. 6 2 0 2 3 ] .

Introduction Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) (OpenAI, 2025) has recently attracted growing attention as post-training paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of large language Work done as an intern at Tongyi Lab, Alibaba Group. 1University of Science and Technology of China 2Tongyi Lab, Alibaba Group. Correspondence to: Yanyong Zhang <yanyongz@ustc.edu.cn>, Yaliang Li <yaliang.li@alibaba-inc.com>. Preprint. February 4, 2026. 1 models (LLMs) (Guo et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025a; Agarwal et al., 2025). It has shown substantial improvements across range of downstream tasks, such as mathematical reasoning (Shao et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025), programming (Wei et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2025), and tool usage (Zhang et al., 2025; Feng et al., 2025). Drawing from reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton et al., 1998), RFT transforms the fine-tuning process into policy optimization problem where LLMs are incentivized to produce high-reward responses. The exploration-exploitation trade-off presents crucial challenge for RFT, potentially leading to unstable performance and stagnation in local optima (Arulkumaran et al., 2017; Ahmed et al., 2019). In this context, the entropy of responses emerges as key diagnostic metric, offering insights into the output diversity of LLMs, and is actively leveraged by recent studies (Yu et al., 2025; Cui et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025; Su et al., 2025) to monitor training dynamics and regulate policy behavior. However, existing methods (Wang et al., 2025; Liao et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025; He et al., 2025) often rely on heuristic designs that treat entropy in isolation and oversimplify its adjustment. Moreover, the divergence in whether these approaches encourage or suppress entropy highlights fundamental lack of in-depth understanding of entropy dynamics (Hu et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2025; An et al., 2025). Such an unprincipled basis can lead to labor-intensive hyperparameter tuning without clear guidance, thus hindering the effective optimization of RFT. As result, theoretically grounded framework is increasingly necessary to characterize entropy dynamics in RFT. To fill this gap, we establish theoretical framework that provides principled understanding of entropy dynamics in RFT. Inspired by (Ren & Sutherland, 2025), we model the update of single tokens logit during optimization, and characterize how it propagates through the models output probability distribution, ultimately influencing the policys entropy. Our derivation reveals that the entropy change direction is determined by the interplay between the update direction (whether the token is rewarded or penalized) and the sign of the proposed discriminator score S, which captures the relationship between token probability and policy entropy. This analysis explains the widely On the Entropy Dynamics in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models observed phenomenon of rapid entropy collapse (Yu et al., 2025) when models are consistently rewarded for generating high-probability and safe responses (Su et al., 2025). Building upon such single-logit analysis, we extend our framework to analyze the entropy change resulting from an optimization step under Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024). We derive an expression that practically computes the entropy change trend leveraging the discriminant and its policy-weighted expectation. Our analysis provides insights for the development of entropybased methods, inspires practical clipping strategies and sheds light on the mechanisms of existing approaches. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose theoretical framework that characterizes the token-level entropy change during policy optimization. We further extend it to practical GRPO optimization step and derive first-order analytical expression, indicating that the direction of entropy change is closely related to the direction of token updates and discriminator score S. Our theoretical analysis provides new insights for the design of entropy control methods. Building upon this, we explain existing entropy control methods from the perspective of entropy dynamics, offering unified and principled theoretical framework for understanding their effects and underlying mechanics. We conduct experiments to provide empirical evidence for our theoretical analysis, showing that can be reliable discriminator for the entropy dynamics. The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived clipping methods in stabilizing the entropy in RFT to promote model exploration. 2.

Large reasoning models achieve strong performance by scaling inference-time chain-of-thought, but this paradigm suffers from quadratic cost, context length limits, and degraded reasoning due to lost-inthe-middle effects. Iterative reasoning mitigates these issues by periodically summarizing intermediate thoughts, yet existing methods rely on supervised learning or fixed heuristics and fail to optimize when to summarize, what to preserve, and how to resume reasoning. We propose InftyThink+, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the entire iterative reasoning trajectory, building on model-controlled iteration boundaries and explicit summarization. InftyThink+ adopts two-stage training scheme with supervised cold-start followed by trajectory-level reinforcement learning, enabling the model to learn strategic summarization and continuation decisions. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B show that InftyThink+ improves accuracy by 21% on AIME24 and outperforms conventional long chain-of-thought reinforcement learning by clear margin, while also generalizing better to out-of-distribution benchmarks. Moreover, InftyThink+ significantly reduces inference latency and accelerates reinforcement learning training, demonstrating improved reasoning efficiency alongside stronger performance.

As foundational capability, GUI grounding is typically established as prerequisite for end-to-end task execution. It enables models to precisely locate interface elements, such as text and icons, to perform accurate operations like clicking and typing. Unlike prior works that fine-tune models already possessing strong spatial awareness (e.g., Qwen3-VL), we aim to master the full technical pipeline by starting from base model with minimal grounding ability, such as POINTS-1.5. We introduce POINTS-GUI-G-8B, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with scores of 59.9 on ScreenSpot-Pro, 66.0 on OSWorld-G, 95.7 on ScreenSpot-v2, and 49.9 on UI-Vision. Our models success is driven by three key factors: (1) Refined Data Engineering, involving the unification of diverse open-source datasets format alongside sophisticated strategies for augmentation, filtering, and difficulty grading; (2) Improved Training Strategies, including continuous fine-tuning of the vision encoder to enhance perceptual accuracy and maintaining resolution consistency between training and inference; and (3) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Verifiable Rewards. While RL is traditionally used to bolster reasoning, we demonstrate that it significantly improves precision in the perception-intensive GUI grounding task.

[ 1 1 7 4 6 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aDense Transformer language models have largely adhered to one consistent architectural shape: each layer consists of an attention module followed by feed-forward network (FFN) with narrowwidenarrow MLP, allocating most parameters to the MLP at expansion ratios between 2 and 4. Motivated by recent results that residual widenarrowwide (hourglass) MLPs offer superior function approximation capabilities, we revisit the long-standing MLP shape convention in Transformer, challenging the necessity of the narrowwidenarrow design. To study this, we develop Transformer variant that replaces the conventional FFN with deeper hourglass-shaped FFN, comprising stack of hourglass sub-MLPs connected by residual pathways. We posit that deeper but lighter hourglass FFN can serve as competitive alternative to the conventional FFN, and that parameters saved by using lighter hourglass FFN can be more effectively utilized, such as by enlarging model hidden dimensions under fixed budgets. We confirm these through empirical validations across model scales: hourglass FFNs outperform conventional FFNs up to 400M and achieve comparable performance at larger scales to 1B parameters; hourglass FFN variants with reduced FFN and increased attention parameters show consistent improvements over conventional configurations at matched budgets. Together, these findings shed new light on recent work and prompt rethinking of the narrow-widenarrow MLP convention and the balance between attention and FFN towards efficient and expressive modern language models. 1.

Performance frontiers of Transformers with hourglass (wide-narrow-wide) versus conventional (narrow-widenarrow) FFNs (Touvron et al., 2023). We revisit the shape convention of Transformer by replacing the narrow-wide-narrow FFN with hourglass FFN, composing stacks of wide-narrow-wide sub-MLPs connected by residuals. We observe that Hourglass FFNs achieve comparable performance to the conventional design up to 1B parameters. Here we also show conventional variant trained based on OLMo-2 architecture. Only the non-embedding parameters are accounted for the FLOPs. models has remained remarkably stable since early scaling studies (Kaplan et al., 2020). Modern models consistently adopt narrowwidenarrow multilayer perceptron (MLP) in feed-forward network (FFN), expanding the model dimension dmodel to an intermediate width dh before projecting back, with expansion ratios typically fixed between 2 and 4 (Vaswani et al., 2017; Kaplan et al., 2020). This design choice has become de facto standard across contemporary dense LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023; Qwen et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025; OLMo et al., 2025). At the same time, the FFN dominates parameter allocation in Transformers, accounting for majority of model parameters relative to attention. As result, the MLP shape implicitly determines how capacity is distributed between depth, width, and attention. While the shape convention in Transformer is effective, we raise fundamental question: is the narrowwidenarrow MLP shape in FFN essential, or merely one convenient instantiation of residual-compatible transformation? Recent results suggest that this convention may be unnecessarily restrictive. Theoretical studies have shown that residual MLPs with widenarrowwide (hourglass) structures can act as optimal function approximators, including universality results for networks with extremely narrow intermediate layers (Lin & Jegelka, 2018; Liu et al., 2024a). From an expressivity perspective, such hourglass architectures permit deeper residual compositions at fixed parameter budgets, Revisiting the Shape Convention of Transformer Language Models Figure 2.

Empirical evidence has also begun to challenge conventional MLP shape assumptions. Motivated by high-dimensional representation learning, Chen et al. (2025) demonstrates that hourglass-shaped MLPs outperform standard designs in generative vision models. Related work further shows that expert-routed FFNs with hourglass MLPs in Mixtureof-Experts Transformers can surpass dense baselines (Wang et al., 2024) at scale. Together, these results indicate that residual hourglass MLPs constitute strong class of building blocks, motivating re-examination of FFN shape conventions in Transformer language models. In this work, we revisit the shape convention of Transformer and study the design space by substituting the conventional narrow-wide-narrow FFN with hourglass FFN variant, consisting of stacked widenarrowwide MLPs with residuals. Such variant offers several advantages. Embedding representations into higher-dimensional spaces before and after narrow transformations increases flexibility for linear separability, consistent with classical results such as Covers theorem and random feature methods for kernel approximation (Cover, 1965; Rahimi & Recht, 2007). Moreover, hourglass MLPs allow parameters to be allocated more efficiently across depth and width, principle that has been successfully exploited in convolutional networks (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016; Zhou et al., 2020) and other deep architectures (Shazeer et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2022). We therefore hypothesize that FFN with wide-narrow-wide MLPs can outperform the conventional counterpart in Transformer language models."

Text:"OmniMoE: An Efficient MoE by Orchestrating Atomic Experts at Scale Jingze Shi 1 Zhangyang Peng 1 Yizhang Zhu 1 Yifan Wu 1 Guang Liu 2 Yuyu LuoMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are evolving towards finer granularity to improve parameter efficiency. However, existing MoE designs face an inherent trade-off between the granularity of expert specialization and hardware execution efficiency. We propose OmniMoE, systemalgorithm co-designed framework that pushes expert granularity to its logical extreme. OmniMoE introduces vector-level Atomic Experts, enabling scalable routing and execution within single MoE layer, while retaining shared dense MLP branch for general-purpose processing. Although this atomic design maximizes capacity, it poses severe challenges for routing complexity and memory access. To address these, OmniMoE adopts system-algorithm co-design: (i) Cartesian Product Router that decomposes the massive index space to reduce routing complexity from O(N ) to O( ); and (ii) Expert-Centric Scheduling that inverts the execution order to turn scattered, memory-bound lookups into efficient dense matrix operations. Validated on seven benchmarks, OmniMoE (with 1.7B active parameters) achieves 50.9% zeroshot accuracy across seven benchmarks, outperforming coarse-grained (e.g., DeepSeekMoE) and fine-grained (e.g., PEER) baselines. Crucially, OmniMoE reduces inference latency from 73ms to 6.7ms (a 10.9 speedup) compared to PEER, demonstrating that massive-scale finegrained MoE can be fast and accurate.

Correspondence to: Yuyu Luo <yuyuluo@hkust-gz.edu.cn>. Preprint. February 6, 2026. 1 Figure 1. Activation Patterns and System Optimization. (a) Coarse-grained MoE activates large experts, inevitably involving redundant parameters and wasting computation. (b) Fine-grained MoE improves parameter efficiency, but suffers from bandwidth bottlenecks due to scattered, fragmented memory accesses. (c) Our OmniMoE employs universally activated shared dense MLP, and uses expert-centric scheduling to reorganize fine-grained expert fetches into contiguous, coalesced memory accesses, achieving both high parameter efficiency and hardware-efficient execution. model capacity from per-token computation (Fedus et al., 2022). By activating only subset of experts for each token, MoEs allow for massive parameter scaling while maintaining manageable inference budgets. central design choice in MoE is the granularity of experts, which largely determines both routing precision and system efficiency. Broadly, existing designs fall into two categories: coarse-grained MoEs and fine-grained MoEs. Coarse-Grained MoEs. Coarse-grained architectures represent the dominant paradigm in contemporary large-scale language models. Representative systems (Du et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2024; Zoph et al., 2022) such as DeepSeekV3 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) (256 experts) and KIMIK2 (Team et al., 2025) (384 experts) instantiate each expert as complete dense FFN, benefiting from hardware-efficient dense matmuls (via Tensor Cores), contiguous VRAM access, and shared-expert general knowledge and training stability (Dai et al., 2024; Nguyen et al., 2025; DeepSeekAI et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025). Despite the success, OmniMoE coarse-grained MoEs inherently suffer from imprecise activation (Szatkowski et al., 2024) and low flexibility. Specifically, activating large expert blocks incurs computation on parameters irrelevant to specific tokens (orange nodes in Figure 1 (a)), leading to computational waste (Cheng et al., 2025; Li et al., 2023; Szatkowski et al., 2024). Moreover, their rigid size hinders adaptation to limited hardware: coarse granularity restricts scaling flexibility, forcing steep, discrete memory increments, when adjusting expert counts. Fine-grained MoEs. Fine-grained architectures seek to maximize expressivity by utilizing millions of lightweight experts (e.g., embeddings). MoE scaling-law analyses (Ludziejewski et al., 2024; Clark et al., 2022) suggest that, under fixed training-token budget, performance improves with the total number of activated experts. This motivates fine-grained MoEs (He, 2024; Nogueira dos Santos et al., 2024) that use extra lightweight experts. For example, PEER (He, 2024) scales to millions of experts by adopting Product Key Memory (PKM (Lample et al., 2019)) style design, enabling precise routing and fine-grained control over both model capacity and activated parameters through smooth scaling. However, scaling fine-grained experts to massive magnitudes introduces three system challenges. (i) Limited expressivity: existing designs (e.g., PEER (He, 2024)) reduce experts to static parameter vectors. This restricts the expert computation to linear vector aggregation, stripping away the token-dependent nonlinear transformations (e.g., MLP projections) essential for modeling complex linguistic dependencies. (ii) Routing overhead: scaling to large expert pool increases routing cost and load imbalance, resulting in skewed expert utilization at scale. (iii) Hardware inefficiency: scattered activations trigger random memory I/O, shifting execution from compute-bound to memorybound and degrading GPU utilization. As illustrated in Figure 1(b), while fine-grained experts ensure precise activation, the active parameters are inherently scattered across memory, which triggers frequent, non-contiguous memory accesses, inevitably shifting the execution bottleneck from computation to memory bandwidth. While coarse-grained MoEs benefit from hardware-friendly architecture, the fine-grained ones leverage high activation efficiency and flexibility. This raises key question: Is it possible to reconcile the parameter efficiency of finegrained models with the hardware efficiency of coarsegrained architectures? Realizing this synergy is non-trivial. It requires holistic orchestration that simultaneously enhances the expressivity of fine-grained experts, minimizing routing overhead in large expert spaces, and reshaping irregular sparse accesses into hardware-efficient execution. Our Methodology and Contributions. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose OmniM"

Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can accept both visual and audio inputs. However, due to the challenge of obtaining text labels with coherent joint-modality information, whether MLLMs can jointly understand both modalities in egocentric videos remains under-explored. To address this problem, we introduce EgoAVU, scalable data engine to automatically generate egocentric audio-visual narrations, questions and answers. EgoAVU enriches human narrations with multimodal context and generates audiovisual narrations through cross-modal correlation modeling. Token-based video filtering and modular, graph based curation ensure both the data diversity and quality. Leveraging EgoAVU, we construct EgoAVU-Instruct large scale training dataset of 3M samples, and EgoAVU-Bench manually verified evaluation split covering diverse tasks. EgoAVU-Bench clearly reveals the limitation of existing MLLMs: they bias heavily towards visual signals, often neglecting audio cues or failing to correspond audio with the visual source. Finetuning MLLMs on EgoAVU-Instruct effectively solves this issue, enabling up to 113% performance improvement on EgoAVU-Bench. Such benefit can also transfer to other benchmarks such as EgoTempo and EgoIllusion, achieving up to 28% relative performance gain. Code will be released to the community.

Text:"Back to Basics: Revisiting Exploration in Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning via Generative Probabilities Pengyi Li 1 Elizaveta Goncharova 1 Andrey Kuznetsov 1 Ivan Oseledets1. Introduction 6 2 0 2 6 ] . [ 2 1 8 2 5 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an indispensable paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to lowentropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse. Specifically, on Qwen2.5-7B, our method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and, notably, by 13.9% in Pass@32, highlighting its superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths. 1FusionBrain Lab, Russia Mathematics, Russia. <li.pengyi@fusionbrainlab.com>. 2Institute of Numerical Pengyi Li Correspondence to: Preprint. February 9, 2026. 1 In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress through Reinforcement Learning (RL)- driven post-training (Sutton et al., 1998; Schulman et al., 2017; Rafailov et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022), particularly in complex reasoning tasks. As simple yet highly efficient training paradigm, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) (Lambert et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025) leverages explicit verification signals to stably induce the generation of longer Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning paths (Shao et al., 2024; Jaech et al., 2024; Team et al., 2025). This, in turn, leads to substantial performance gains on high-difficulty reasoning tasks, consistent with prior findings on the effectiveness of CoT reasoning and test-time scaling (Wei et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2025). However, although RLVR can effectively improve task success rates, its training process is often accompanied by obvious entropy collapse and mode collapse phenomena, leading to reasoning paths generated by the model being highly concentrated on few dominant solutions. This issue inherently stems from the reward-weighted likelihood maximization objective: this objective continuously amplifies the probability mass of high-reward trajectories during optimization, thereby compressing the probability space occupied by lowfrequency but equally valid reasoning paths, weakening the models exploration capabilities (Yue et al., 2025). Addressing the aforementioned issues, existing works have attempted to mitigate mode collapse by introducing entropy regularization (Ziebart et al., 2008; Haarnoja et al., 2018; Cui et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b), clip-higher (Yu et al., 2025), dynamic clipping strategies (Yang et al., 2025b), or high-entropy token promotion mechanisms (Wang et al., 2025a). However, these methods remain largely limited to local modifications within the reward maximization framework, making it difficult to fundamentally improve the ability to model diverse reasoning paths. On the other hand, recent research indicates that applying penalties only to incorrect trajectories while maintaining relatively flat reward structure for correct ones can, to certain extent, increase the diversity of the solution space (Zhu et al., 2025b). This phenomenon further demonstrates that the relative probability structure among reasoning paths plays critical role in Back to Basics: Revisiting Exploration in Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning via Generative Probabilities shaping the models exploration behavior. From the perspective of generative modeling, the reasoning process of LLMs is essentially token-by-token probabilistic sampling process. When the policy becomes overly deterministic on few trajectories, the diversity of the sampling distribution inevitably drops (Li et al., 2025). Based on this observation, we propose new reinforcement learning paradigm, Probabilistic based GRPO (ProGRPO), which re-examines the construction of Advantage from the perspective of probability distributions. Specifically, ProGRPO utilizes the internal probability signals of the prompt and the generated answer from the LLM, combined with verifiable rewards, to reshape the Advantage distribution, thereby implicitly reshaping the effective reward-weighted trajectory distribution optimized by the policy gradient. This re-weighting mechanism based on probability structure can effectively alleviate the entropy collapse problem and significantly enhance the diversity of reasoning paths and training stability. Our main contributions include: Methodology: We propose ProGRPO, principled extension of GRPO that incorporates novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM). By introducing confidence-aware signals into the advantage function, our method achieves targeted exploration without compromising training stability. Broad Effectiveness: We validate ProGRPO across diverse reasoning and code generation benchmarks using Qwen2.5 (7B, 32B) and DeepSeek models. Our method consistently outperforms mainstream baselines like GRPO and FlowRL, demonstrating strong scalability and generalization across different model sizes. OOD Robustness: Beyond standard benchmarks, ProGRPO exhibits superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) adaptability, maintaining robust performance on unseen data distributions. Significant Gains: ProGRPO substantially enhances both accuracy and output diversity. On Qwen2.57B, it improves Pass@1 and Pass@32 by 5.7% and 13.9% respecti"

The paper establishes a theoretical framework for analyzing entropy dynamics in reinforcement fine-tuning of large language models, deriving expressions for entropy change and proposing entropy control methods based on discriminant analysis.  					AI-generated summary 				 Entropy serves as a critical metric for measuring the diversity of outputs generated by large language models (LLMs), providing valuable insights into their exploration capabilities. While recent studies increasingly focus on monitoring and adjusting entropy to better balance exploration and exploitation in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a principled understanding of entropy dynamics during this process is yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework for analyzing the entropy dynamics during the RFT process, which begins with a discriminant expression that quantifies entropy change under a single logit update. This foundation enables the derivation of a first-order expression for entropy change, which can be further extended to the update formula of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The corollaries and insights drawn from the theoretical analysis inspire the design of entropy control methods, and also offer a unified lens for interpreting various entropy-based methods in existing studies. We provide empirical evidence to support the main conclusions of our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived entropy-discriminator clipping methods. This study yields novel insights into RFT training dynamics, providing theoretical support and practical strategies for optimizing the exploration-exploitation balance during LLM fine-tuning.

PlanViz benchmark evaluates unified multimodal models' capabilities in computer-use planning tasks through route planning, work diagramming, and web&UI displaying sub-tasks with a task-adaptive scoring system.  					AI-generated summary 				 Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating natural images and supporting multimodal reasoning. However, their potential in supporting computer-use planning tasks, which are closely related to our lives, remain underexplored. Image generation and editing in computer-use tasks require capabilities like spatial reasoning and procedural understanding, and it is still unknown whether UMMs have these capabilities to finish these tasks or not. Therefore, we propose PlanViz, a new benchmark designed to evaluate image generation and editing for computer-use tasks. To achieve the goal of our evaluation, we focus on sub-tasks which frequently involve in daily life and require planning steps. Specifically, three new sub-tasks are designed: route planning, work diagramming, and web&UI displaying. We address challenges in data quality ensuring by curating human-annotated questions and reference images, and a quality control process. For challenges of comprehensive and exact evaluation, a task-adaptive score, PlanScore, is proposed. The score helps understanding the correctness, visual quality and efficiency of generated images. Through experiments, we highlight key limitations and opportunities for future research on this topic.

TRIT framework improves multilingual reasoning by jointly training translation and reasoning components, enhancing question understanding and response generation across languages.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long reasoning models often struggle in multilingual settings: they tend to reason in English for non-English questions; when constrained to reasoning in the question language, accuracies drop substantially. The struggle is caused by the limited abilities for both multilingual question understanding and multilingual reasoning. To address both problems, we propose TRIT (Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training), a self-improving framework that integrates the training of translation into multilingual reasoning. Without external feedback or additional multilingual data, our method jointly enhances multilingual question understanding and response generation. On MMATH, our method outperforms multiple baselines by an average of 7 percentage points, improving both answer correctness and language consistency. Further analysis reveals that integrating translation training improves cross-lingual question alignment by over 10 percentage points and enhances translation quality for both mathematical questions and general-domain text, with gains up to 8.4 COMET points on FLORES-200.

InftyThink+ uses reinforcement learning to optimize iterative reasoning processes, improving accuracy and efficiency in large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large reasoning models achieve strong performance by scaling inference-time chain-of-thought, but this paradigm suffers from quadratic cost, context length limits, and degraded reasoning due to lost-in-the-middle effects. Iterative reasoning mitigates these issues by periodically summarizing intermediate thoughts, yet existing methods rely on supervised learning or fixed heuristics and fail to optimize when to summarize, what to preserve, and how to resume reasoning. We propose InftyThink+, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the entire iterative reasoning trajectory, building on model-controlled iteration boundaries and explicit summarization. InftyThink+ adopts a two-stage training scheme with supervised cold-start followed by trajectory-level reinforcement learning, enabling the model to learn strategic summarization and continuation decisions. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B show that InftyThink+ improves accuracy by 21% on AIME24 and outperforms conventional long chain-of-thought reinforcement learning by a clear margin, while also generalizing better to out-of-distribution benchmarks. Moreover, InftyThink+ significantly reduces inference latency and accelerates reinforcement learning training, demonstrating improved reasoning efficiency alongside stronger performance.

GUI agents for automated digital tasks rely on vision-language models with enhanced grounding capabilities, achieved through refined data engineering, improved training strategies, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid advancement of vision-language models has catalyzed the emergence of GUI agents, which hold immense potential for automating complex tasks, from online shopping to flight booking, thereby alleviating the burden of repetitive digital workflows. As a foundational capability, GUI grounding is typically established as a prerequisite for end-to-end task execution. It enables models to precisely locate interface elements, such as text and icons, to perform accurate operations like clicking and typing. Unlike prior works that fine-tune models already possessing strong spatial awareness (e.g., Qwen3-VL), we aim to master the full technical pipeline by starting from a base model with minimal grounding ability, such as POINTS-1.5. We introduce POINTS-GUI-G-8B, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with scores of 59.9 on ScreenSpot-Pro, 66.0 on OSWorld-G, 95.7 on ScreenSpot-v2, and 49.9 on UI-Vision. Our model's success is driven by three key factors: (1) Refined Data Engineering, involving the unification of diverse open-source datasets format alongside sophisticated strategies for augmentation, filtering, and difficulty grading; (2) Improved Training Strategies, including continuous fine-tuning of the vision encoder to enhance perceptual accuracy and maintaining resolution consistency between training and inference; and (3) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Verifiable Rewards. While RL is traditionally used to bolster reasoning, we demonstrate that it significantly improves precision in the perception-intensive GUI grounding task. Furthermore, GUI grounding provides a natural advantage for RL, as rewards are easily verifiable and highly accurate.

"A comprehensive memory-focused benchmark for mobile GUI agents reveals significant memory capability gaps and provides systematic evaluation methods and design insights.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current mobile GUI agent benchmarks systematically fail to assess memory capabilities, with only 5.2-11.8% memory-related tasks and no cross-session learning evaluation. We introduce MemGUI-Bench, a comprehensive memory-centric benchmark with pass@k and staged LLM-as-judge evaluation. Our contributions include: (1) a systematic memory taxonomy analyzing 11 agents across 5 architectures; (2) 128 tasks across 26 applications where 89.8% challenge memory through cross-temporal and cross-spatial retention; (3) MemGUI-Eval, an automated pipeline with Progressive Scrutiny and 7 hierarchical metrics; and (4) RQ-driven assessment of 11 state-of-the-art agents. Our experiments reveal significant memory deficits across all evaluated systems, identify 5 distinct failure modes, and synthesize 5 actionable design implications. All resources including code, benchmark, and evaluation results will be \textit{fully open-sourced and continuously maintained} at https://lgy0404.github.io/MemGUI-Bench/."

DreamDojo is a foundation world model trained on 44k hours of egocentric human videos that enables efficient simulation of dexterous robotic tasks through continuous latent actions and real-time distillation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Being able to simulate the outcomes of actions in varied environments will revolutionize the development of generalist agents at scale. However, modeling these world dynamics, especially for dexterous robotics tasks, poses significant challenges due to limited data coverage and scarce action labels. As an endeavor towards this end, we introduce DreamDojo, a foundation world model that learns diverse interactions and dexterous controls from 44k hours of egocentric human videos. Our data mixture represents the largest video dataset to date for world model pretraining, spanning a wide range of daily scenarios with diverse objects and skills. To address the scarcity of action labels, we introduce continuous latent actions as unified proxy actions, enhancing interaction knowledge transfer from unlabeled videos. After post-training on small-scale target robot data, DreamDojo demonstrates a strong understanding of physics and precise action controllability. We also devise a distillation pipeline that accelerates DreamDojo to a real-time speed of 10.81 FPS and further improves context consistency. Our work enables several important applications based on generative world models, including live teleoperation, policy evaluation, and model-based planning. Systematic evaluation on multiple challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks verifies the significance of our method for simulating open-world, contact-rich tasks, paving the way for general-purpose robot world models.

Replacing conventional feed-forward networks with hourglass-shaped MLPs in Transformers improves model efficiency and performance by enabling better parameter utilization and competitive scaling.  					AI-generated summary 				 Dense Transformer language models have largely adhered to one consistent architectural shape: each layer consists of an attention module followed by a feed-forward network (FFN) with a narrow-wide-narrow MLP, allocating most parameters to the MLP at expansion ratios between 2 and 4. Motivated by recent results that residual wide-narrow-wide (hourglass) MLPs offer superior function approximation capabilities, we revisit the long-standing MLP shape convention in Transformer, challenging the necessity of the narrow-wide-narrow design. To study this, we develop a Transformer variant that replaces the conventional FFN with a deeper hourglass-shaped FFN, comprising a stack of hourglass sub-MLPs connected by residual pathways. We posit that a deeper but lighter hourglass FFN can serve as a competitive alternative to the conventional FFN, and that parameters saved by using a lighter hourglass FFN can be more effectively utilized, such as by enlarging model hidden dimensions under fixed budgets. We confirm these through empirical validations across model scales: hourglass FFNs outperform conventional FFNs up to 400M and achieve comparable performance at larger scales to 1B parameters; hourglass FFN variants with reduced FFN and increased attention parameters show consistent improvements over conventional configurations at matched budgets. Together, these findings shed new light on recent work and prompt a rethinking of the narrow-wide-narrow MLP convention and the balance between attention and FFN towards efficient and expressive modern language models.

Validated on seven benchmarks, OmniMoE (with 1.7B active parameters) achieves 50.9% zero-shot accuracy across seven benchmarks, outperforming coarse-grained (e.g., DeepSeekMoE) and fine-grained (e.g., PEER) baselines.

Multi-modal large language models struggle to jointly understand audio and visual signals in egocentric videos, but a new scalable data engine and dataset significantly improve their performance through targeted fine-tuning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Understanding egocentric videos plays a vital role for embodied intelligence. Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can accept both visual and audio inputs. However, due to the challenge of obtaining text labels with coherent joint-modality information, whether MLLMs can jointly understand both modalities in egocentric videos remains under-explored. To address this problem, we introduce EgoAVU, a scalable data engine to automatically generate egocentric audio-visual narrations, questions, and answers. EgoAVU enriches human narrations with multimodal context and generates audio-visual narrations through cross-modal correlation modeling. Token-based video filtering and modular, graph-based curation ensure both data diversity and quality. Leveraging EgoAVU, we construct EgoAVU-Instruct, a large-scale training dataset of 3M samples, and EgoAVU-Bench, a manually verified evaluation split covering diverse tasks. EgoAVU-Bench clearly reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs: they bias heavily toward visual signals, often neglecting audio cues or failing to correspond audio with the visual source. Finetuning MLLMs on EgoAVU-Instruct effectively addresses this issue, enabling up to 113% performance improvement on EgoAVU-Bench. Such benefits also transfer to other benchmarks such as EgoTempo and EgoIllusion, achieving up to 28% relative performance gain. Code will be released to the community.

A novel reinforcement learning approach called ARM addresses entropy collapse in LLM reasoning by equilibrating confidence levels across correct responses through dynamic reward shaping.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an indispensable paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse. Specifically, on Qwen2.5-7B, our method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and, notably, by 13.9% in Pass@32, highlighting its superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths.

"A novel reinforcement learning approach called ARM addresses entropy collapse in LLM reasoning by equilibrating confidence levels across correct responses through dynamic reward shaping.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an indispensable paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse. Specifically, on Qwen2.5-7B, our method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and, notably, by 13.9% in Pass@32, highlighting its superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths."

Knowledge purification techniques consolidate rationales from multiple teacher LLMs to reduce conflicts and improve efficiency in distillation processes.  					AI-generated summary 				 Knowledge distillation has emerged as a pivotal technique for transferring knowledge from stronger large language models (LLMs) to smaller, more efficient models. However, traditional distillation approaches face challenges related to knowledge conflicts and high resource demands, particularly when leveraging multiple teacher models. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Knowledge Purification, which consolidates the rationales from multiple teacher LLMs into a single rationale, thereby mitigating conflicts and enhancing efficiency. To investigate the effectiveness of knowledge purification, we further propose five purification methods from various perspectives. Our experiments demonstrate that these methods not only improve the performance of the distilled model but also effectively alleviate knowledge conflicts. Moreover, router-based methods exhibit robust generalization capabilities, underscoring the potential of innovative purification techniques in optimizing multi-teacher distillation and facilitating the practical deployment of powerful yet lightweight models.
