Text:"Self-Improving World Modelling with Latent Actions Yifu Qiu 1 Zheng Zhao 1 Waylon Li 1 Yftah Ziser 2 3 Anna Korhonen 4 Shay B. Cohen 1 Edoardo M. Ponti1. Introduction 6 2 0 2 5 ] . [ 1 0 3 1 6 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Internal modelling of the worldpredicting transitions between previous states and next states under actions Zis essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly actionlabelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, selfimprovement framework that learns from stateonly sequences by treating actions as latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) Pθ(Y X, Z) and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) Qϕ(ZX, ). SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen models logprobability as reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABENCH, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WORLDPREDICTIONBENCH, and 14% on STABLETOOLBENCH.1 1University of Edinburgh 2Nvidia Research 3University of Groningen 4University of Cambridge. Correspondence to: Yifu Qiu <yifu.qiu@ed.ac.uk>. Preprint. February 9, 2026. 1The code and models developed in this paper will be made available at https://github.com/yfqiu-nlp/swirl. Intrinsic world modelling is models latent understanding of the environment and agent dynamics, i.e., trajectories of states and actions, which enables simulating possible futures without hallucinations. Large foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have arguably been shown to internalise world modelling to some extent during their training, thus enabling reasoning and planning without an external, specialised world model (Vafa et al., 2024; Qiu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025b; Chen et al., 2025b; Wang et al.; Xiong et al., 2026). For example, explicitly training models to predict the results of invoking tools (Guo et al., 2025b) or executing code (Copet et al., 2025) significantly enhances tool calling and coding tasks. This ability can also transfer to spatial reasoning tasks (Qiu et al., 2025; Tehenan et al., 2025) and reduce hallucinations that contradict external regularities (Liu et al., 2025a; Chen et al., 2025b). While promising, the development of robust internal world models faces significant bottleneck in data scalability. Current approaches rely heavily on execution logs or trajectories where observations are densely annotated with specific actions, because such annotations are naturally available in restricted environments (e.g., logs for tool calling or coding). However, for open-world tasks, collecting manual annotations for every transition is prohibitively expensive and intractable. Moreover, an additional challenge is the inherent ambiguity of inverse dynamics: transition between two states may be explained by multiple valid actions, making purely supervised learning brittle when data is sparse. Inspired by recent advances in self-improving learning for other applications (Wang et al., 2025a;c; Jin et al., 2025; Mao et al., 2025; Jin et al., 2025), we propose SWIRL (Selfimproving World modelling with Iterative RL), reciprocal optimisation framework to enhance the intrinsic world modelling of LLMs and VLMs from state-only sequences where the intermediate action is latent. We formalise world modelling as two components (Wang et al., 2025b; Qiu et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025a): Forward World Modelling (FWM; predicting the next state given current state and latent action x, z), and Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM; inferring latent action given states x, y). In our reciprocal frameSelf-Improving World Modelling with Latent Actions Figure 1. In SWIRL (Self-improving World modelling with Iterative RL), we facilitate the world modelling ability of foundation models (LLMs and VLMs) by modelling two components: Forward World Model (FWM) Pθ(y x, z) and Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM) Qϕ(z x, y). These components are iteratively optimised through RL (specifically, GRPO) in two distinct phases: I) the FDM acts as policy and the IDM as reward to ensure identifiability between actions and next states; II) the IDM acts as policy and the FDM as reward to ensure data fidelity to the state-only sequences. The KL term is omitted from the figure for simplicity. work, we optimise the FWM Pθ to generate futures that are consistently identifiable by the IDM, and the IDM Qϕ to infer actions that maximise the likelihood of the state dynamics predicted by the FWM. From variational inference perspective, we theoretically prove that the optimisation of FWM is equivalent to maximising lower bound on the Conditional Mutual Information I(Z; ˆY X) (Barber & Agakov, 2003) between the latent and future states ˆY predicted by the FWM; and that the optimisation of the IDM is equivalent to performing coordinate ascent on the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of the log-likelihood log Pθ(Y X). Without relying on ground-truth action annotations, we optimise such reciprocal framework with Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO; Guo et al. 2025a). FWM and IDM take alternating roles of policy and reward, iterating until both components converge. We validate our framework across four distinct environments on six benchmarks: open-world visual dynamics for VLMs on AURORA-BENCH, BYTEMORPH and WORLDPREDICTIONBENCH, synthetic textual worlds on SCIENCEWORLD, web HTML on MIND2WEB, and tool calling on STABLETOOLBENCH for LLMs. Empirical results confirm that our reciprocal self-improving allows models to learn effective dynamics from unlabelled state sequences, outperforming supervised fine-tuning baselines and achieving parity with larger, state-of-the-art models. Our contributions are summarised as follows: We propose novel self-improving framework for world modelling in LLMs and VLMs, reciprocally reinforcing FWM and IDM without action annotations.

SWIRL is a self-improvement framework that learns world models from state-only sequences by alternating between forward and inverse dynamics modeling with variational information maximization and ELBO maximization, achieving improved performance on various reasoning and planning benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Internal modelling of the world -- predicting transitions between previous states X and next states Y under actions Z -- is essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly action-labelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) P_θ(Y|X,Z) and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) Q_φ(Z|X,Y). SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench.

"SWIRL is a self-improvement framework that learns world models from state-only sequences by alternating between forward and inverse dynamics modeling with variational information maximization and ELBO maximization, achieving improved performance on various reasoning and planning benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Internal modelling of the world -- predicting transitions between previous states X and next states Y under actions Z -- is essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly action-labelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) P_θ(Y|X,Z) and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) Q_φ(Z|X,Y). SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench."
