We introduce AgentOCR, framework that exploits the superior information density of visual tokens by representing the accumulated observation-action history as compact rendered image. To make multi-turn rollouts scalable, AgentOCR proposes segment optical caching. By decomposing history into hashable segments and maintaining visual cache, this mechanism eliminates redundant re-rendering. Beyond fixed rendering, AgentOCR introduces agentic self-compression, where the agent actively emits compression rate and is trained with compression-aware reward to adaptively balance task success and token efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks, ALFWorld and search-based QA. Remarkably, results demonstrate that AgentOCR preserves over 95% of text-based agent performance while substantially reducing token consumption (>50%), yielding consistent token and memory efficiency. Our further analysis validates 20 rendering speedup from segment optical caching and the effective strategic balancing of self-compression. Date: January 8, 2026 Correspondence: Bo An (boan@ntu.edu.sg) 1.

  "desc": "AgentOCR — это фреймворк, который снижает потребление токенов в агентных системах, преобразуя историю взаимодействия в компактные визуальные токены вместо текстовых. Система использует сегментное оптическое кэширование, которое исключает избыточный пересчёт истории путём хеширования и кэширования визуальных представлений. Агент самостоятельно выбирает степень сжатия и обучается с помощью вознаграждения, чувствительного к сжатию, чтобы адаптивно балансировать успех задачи и эффективность токенов. На сложных бенчмарках AgentOCR сохраняет более 95% производительности текстовых агентов при сокращении потребления токенов более чем на 50%.",

"AgentOCR reduces token consumption in agentic systems by representing interaction history as visual tokens and employing visual caching and self-compression techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable agentic systems trained with reinforcement learning (RL) over multi-turn interaction trajectories, but practical deployment is bottlenecked by rapidly growing textual histories that inflate token budgets and memory usage. We introduce AgentOCR, a framework that exploits the superior information density of visual tokens by representing the accumulated observation-action history as a compact rendered image. To make multi-turn rollouts scalable, AgentOCR proposes segment optical caching. By decomposing history into hashable segments and maintaining a visual cache, this mechanism eliminates redundant re-rendering. Beyond fixed rendering, AgentOCR introduces agentic self-compression, where the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with compression-aware reward to adaptively balance task success and token efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks, ALFWorld and search-based QA. Remarkably, results demonstrate that AgentOCR preserves over 95\% of text-based agent performance while substantially reducing token consumption (>50\%), yielding consistent token and memory efficiency. Our further analysis validates a 20x rendering speedup from segment optical caching and the effective strategic balancing of self-compression."

**Justification:**

1. **OPTIMIZATION**: The paper focuses on reducing token consumption and improving efficiency in agentic systems through visual caching and compression techniques. This directly addresses training and operational optimization methods.

2. **LONG_CONTEXT**: The paper addresses the problem of "rapidly growing textual histories that inflate token budgets and memory usage" and proposes methods to handle extended interaction trajectories more efficiently, which is central to long context handling.
