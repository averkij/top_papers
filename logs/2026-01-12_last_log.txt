Afri-MCQA benchmark demonstrates poor performance of open-weight LLMs in African languages, highlighting the need for culturally grounded pretraining and speech-first approaches in AI development.  					AI-generated summary 				 Africa is home to over one-third of the world's languages, yet remains underrepresented in AI research. We introduce Afri-MCQA, the first Multilingual Cultural Question-Answering benchmark covering 7.5k Q&A pairs across 15 African languages from 12 countries. The benchmark offers parallel English-African language Q&A pairs across text and speech modalities and was entirely created by native speakers. Benchmarking large language models (LLMs) on Afri-MCQA shows that open-weight models perform poorly across evaluated cultures, with near-zero accuracy on open-ended VQA when queried in native language or speech. To evaluate linguistic competence, we include control experiments meant to assess this specific aspect separate from cultural knowledge, and we observe significant performance gaps between native languages and English for both text and speech. These findings underscore the need for speech-first approaches, culturally grounded pretraining, and cross-lingual cultural transfer.

Legal alignment explores how legal principles and methods can guide AI system design to ensure safety, ethics, and compliance through three research directions involving rule adherence, legal reasoning methods, and structural blueprints for AI reliability and trust.  					AI-generated summary 				 Alignment of artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the normative problem of specifying how AI systems should act and the technical problem of ensuring AI systems comply with those specifications. To date, AI alignment has generally overlooked an important source of knowledge and practice for grappling with these problems: law. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by exploring how legal rules, principles, and methods can be leveraged to address problems of alignment and inform the design of AI systems that operate safely and ethically. This emerging field -- legal alignment -- focuses on three research directions: (1) designing AI systems to comply with the content of legal rules developed through legitimate institutions and processes, (2) adapting methods from legal interpretation to guide how AI systems reason and make decisions, and (3) harnessing legal concepts as a structural blueprint for confronting challenges of reliability, trust, and cooperation in AI systems. These research directions present new conceptual, empirical, and institutional questions, which include examining the specific set of laws that particular AI systems should follow, creating evaluations to assess their legal compliance in real-world settings, and developing governance frameworks to support the implementation of legal alignment in practice. Tackling these questions requires expertise across law, computer science, and other disciplines, offering these communities the opportunity to collaborate in designing AI for the better.

  "desc": "Статья исследует правовое выравнивание (legal alignment) — новое направление в области AI, которое использует юридические принципы и методы для обеспечения безопасности и этичности AI систем. Авторы предлагают три основных исследовательских направления: разработка AI систем, соответствующих содержанию правовых норм, адаптация методов юридического толкования для принятия решений AI, и использование правовых концепций как структурной основы для надежности и доверия. Подход требует междисциплинарного сотрудничества между специалистами в области права и компьютерных наук для создания框架управления и оценки соответствия AI систем действующему законодательству. Это позволяет рассмотреть как специфические законы, применимые к конкретным AI системам, так и практические механизмы их реализации.",
