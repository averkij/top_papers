A framework converts transient critiques into retrievable guidelines using a file-based memory system and agent-controlled tool calls, enabling LLMs to match test-time refinement performance with reduced inference costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose a framework that amortizes the cost of inference-time reasoning by converting transient critiques into retrievable guidelines, through a file-based memory system and agent-controlled tool calls. We evaluate this method on the Rubric Feedback Bench, a novel dataset for rubric-based learning. Experiments demonstrate that our augmented LLMs rapidly match the performance of test-time refinement pipelines while drastically reducing inference cost.
