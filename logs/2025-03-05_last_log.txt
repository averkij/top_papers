Text:"PipeOffload: Improving Scalability of Pipeline Parallelism with Memory Optimization Xinyi Wan * 1 2 Penghui Qi * 1 2 Guangxing Huang 1 Jialin Li 2 Min Lin 1 5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 8 2 3 1 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r Abstract Pipeline parallelism (PP) is widely used for training large language models (LLMs), yet its scalability is often constrained by high activation memory consumption as the number of in-flight microbatches grows with the degree of PP. In this paper, we focus on addressing this challenge by leveraging the under-explored memory offload strategy in PP. With empirical study, we discover that in the majority of standard configurations, at least half, and potentially all, of the activations can be offloaded with negligible overhead. In the cases where full overload is not possible, we introduce novel selective offload strategy that decreases peak activation memory in better-than-linear manner. Furthermore, we integrate memory offload with other techniques to jointly consider overall throughput and memory limitation. Our experiments proves that the per-device activation memory effectively reduces with the total number of stages, making PP stronger alternative than TP, offering up to 19% acceleration with even lower memory consumption. The implementation is open-sourced at this url. 1. Introduction As modern large transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) scale towards trillions of parameters, model parallelism becomes essential for distributing model parameters across multiple devices. Compared to ZeRO (Rajbhandari et al., 2020) and tensor parallelism (Shoeybi et al., 2019), pipeline parallel (PP) (Huang et al., 2019; Harlap et al., 2018) has lower communication volume and higher arithmetic intensity. However, while PP shards layers across devices to reduce parameter memory requirements, its scalability remains constrained by the activation memory. Increasing the number of PP stages reduces layers per device but ne- *Equal contribution 1Sea AI Lab 2National University of "

Introduction While current large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive intrinsic reasoning capabilities (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022), recent work (Yao et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024) has demonstrated that eliciting more deliberate reasoning through explicit tree search improves performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. During this search process, policy LLM proposes possible actions from the current state, and value LLM evaluates and selects the most promising states to explore. Recent work has found the strength of the value model to be strongly correlated with overall performance (Chen et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a). Much prior work on LLM-based tree search simply prompts an off-the-shelf LLM to serve as both the policy and value models during the search process, where performance is constrained by the capabilities of this model. Recent approaches have addressed this constraint by utilizing ground truth task completion rewards during Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to guide node selection. Zhou et al. (2024) show that MCTS using these rewards can outperform gradient-based methods 1Georgia Institute of Technology. Correspondence to: Ethan Mendes <emendes3@gatech.edu>. 1 that train on human demonstrations or rejection sampled trajectories. However, collecting ground-truth rewards can be costly. For example, in interactive domains like web tasks, data collection can cost thousands of dollars (Yao et al., 2022a). This constraint motivates the need for new methods that can perform self-supervised training of the policy or value LLM without ground truth rewards. In this paper, we introduce self-taught lookahead (STL), technique that enables an LLM-based value model to improve itself by bootstrapping an initial value function and leveraging the environments state transition dynamics without requiring any ground-truth rewards. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that an LLM-based value function can self-improve without labels or rewards. We show that using this self-improved value model during search can outperform computationally expensive MCTS methods (Zhou et al., 2024), while reducing inference costs by an order of magnitude. The self-taught lookahead (STL) process (Figure 1) begins by generating self-improvement data through single step of lookahead within tree search. Analogous to the Bellman update, this lookahead refines the estimated value of state by leveraging information about potential future states. However, unlike classical reinforcement learning (RL) methods, which rely on explicit environment rewards, STL uses large language model (LLM) to estimate state values. Specifically, we fine-tune value model to reason about the utility of state by predicting the next best action, its resulting state, and corresponding rationale for the value of that state. During training, the model is fine-tuned using rollouts of states and actions within the environment. At inference time, the value model simulates step of lookahead to provide more accurate value judgments. STL, therefore, more explicitly captures the paradigm of verbal reinforcement learning than previous work (Shinn et al., 2024) by learning from natural language representation of the mechanics of traditional RL algorithm. By learning to simulate the entire process of lookahead rather than only iterated values, STL can leverage the strong generalization improvements of LLMs resulting from this sort of rationalization (Nye et al., 2021; Zelikman et al., 2022). Our results (4) demonstrate that tree search with an STL fine-tuned llama-3.1-8b-instruct value Language Models can Self-Improve at State-Value Estimation for Better Search Figure 1. Self-taught lookahead self-improves the value model by learning from state-transition dynamics. During the data generation phase (top left), tree search is used to discover diverse states. For every observed state encountered during the search, successor states are expanded using base policy πθ and the current value model Vϕk , and formatted textual training example is formed using verbal representations of the next best action and successor state, as well as Vϕk outputted value reasoning (r) and numerical value (v) (top middle). These examples are used to fine-tune Vϕk+1 , which will be used in the next iteration of the algorithm (top right). Value models learned during self-taught lookahead can be used to evaluate unseen states encountered during search on unseen tasks by simulating step of lookahead including the next best action and the best successor state (bottom). model improves performance by 39% or more compared to the base model and matches the performance of search with base gpt-4o value model on unseen tasks. We show that these results hold across web agent and math reasoning domains, including WebShop (Yao et al., 2022a) and Game-of-24 (Yao et al., 2024). Finally, in 5, we demonstrate that search with STL value models achieves Pareto optimality when considering cost and environment usage (states expanded). The results reveal that self-taught lookahead effectively transfers computation from expensive large closed-source models to cheaper opensource alternatives, achieving 37 cost reduction while outperforming previous LLM tree search methods (Zhou et al., 2024) by 20%. Additionally, we analyze scaling trends for self-taught lookahead and find that STL can even be utilized to improve smaller models ( 3 billion parameters). 2. Background 2.1.

Pipeline parallelism (PP) is widely used for training large language models (LLMs), yet its scalability is often constrained by high activation memory consumption as the number of in-flight microbatches grows with the degree of PP. In this paper, we focus on addressing this challenge by leveraging the under-explored memory offload strategy in PP. With empirical study, we discover that in the majority of standard configurations, at least half, and potentially all, of the activations can be offloaded with negligible overhead. In the cases where full overload is not possible, we introduce a novel selective offload strategy that decreases peak activation memory in a better-than-linear manner. Furthermore, we integrate memory offload with other techniques to jointly consider overall throughput and memory limitation. Our experiments proves that the per-device activation memory effectively reduces with the total number of stages, making PP a stronger alternative than TP, offering up to a 19\% acceleration with even lower memory consumption. The implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/sail-sg/zero-bubble-pipeline-parallelism{this url}.

Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across multi-domain tasks. Existing agent tuning approaches typically employ supervised finetuning on entire expert trajectories. However, behavior-cloning of full trajectories can introduce expert bias and weaken generalization to states not covered by the expert data. Additionally, critical steps, such as planning, complex reasoning for intermediate subtasks, and strategic decision-making, are essential to success in agent tasks, so learning these steps is the key to improving LLM agents. For more effective and efficient agent tuning, we propose ATLaS that identifies the critical steps in expert trajectories and finetunes LLMs solely on these steps with reduced costs. By steering the training's focus to a few critical steps, our method mitigates the risk of overfitting entire trajectories and promotes generalization across different environments and tasks. In extensive experiments, an LLM finetuned on only 30% critical steps selected by ATLaS outperforms the LLM finetuned on all steps and recent open-source LLM agents. ATLaS maintains and improves base LLM skills as generalist agents interacting with diverse environments.

Collecting ground truth task completion rewards or human demonstrations for multi-step reasoning tasks is often cost-prohibitive and time-consuming, especially in interactive domains like web tasks. To address this bottleneck, we present self-taught lookahead, a self-supervised method that leverages state-transition dynamics to train a value model capable of effectively guiding language model-controlled search. We find that moderately sized (8 billion parameters) open-weight value models improved with self-taught lookahead can match the performance of using a frontier LLM such as gpt-4o as the value model. Furthermore, we find that self-taught lookahead improves performance by 20% while reducing costs 37x compared to previous LLM-based tree search, without relying on ground truth rewards.

Advancing AI in computational pathology requires large, high-quality, and diverse datasets, yet existing public datasets are often limited in organ diversity, class coverage, or annotation quality. To bridge this gap, we introduce SPIDER (Supervised Pathology Image-DEscription Repository), the largest publicly available patch-level dataset covering multiple organ types, including Skin, Colorectal, and Thorax, with comprehensive class coverage for each organ. SPIDER provides high-quality annotations verified by expert pathologists and includes surrounding context patches, which enhance classification performance by providing spatial context.   Alongside the dataset, we present baseline models trained on SPIDER using the Hibou-L foundation model as a feature extractor combined with an attention-based classification head. The models achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple tissue categories and serve as strong benchmarks for future digital pathology research. Beyond patch classification, the model enables rapid identification of significant areas, quantitative tissue metrics, and establishes a foundation for multimodal approaches.   Both the dataset and trained models are publicly available to advance research, reproducibility, and AI-driven pathology development. Access them at: https://github.com/HistAI/SPIDER
