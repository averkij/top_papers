Via an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that UVA can serve as general-purpose solution for wide range of robotics tasks without compromising performance compared to methods tailored for specific applications. Results are best viewed on our website. I. INTRODUCTION unified video and action model that jointly learns an agents actions and their effects on visual observations holds great promise for robotics videos provide rich environmental context for predicting actions, while actions reveal how interactions drive visual changes, enabling more accurate modeling of real-world dynamics. However, despite its promise, previous approaches have often failed to fully realize this potential. key challenge lies in the inherent mismatch between the requirements of action and video generation. Action modeling demands high temporal speed to capture dense, fine-grained motions, while video generation requires high spatial resolution to produce high-fidelity visual outputs, which often results in slower processing speeds. Previous policy learning approaches have struggled to balance these conflicting requirements, often focusing on one aspect at the expense of the other. For instance, action only methods like [9, 22, 48] bypass video generation entirely. While such approaches reduce computational complexity, they overlook the benefits of video generation adding observation supervision helps the model learn scene dynamics, which reduces overfitting to action history and enhances robustness to visual disturbances. On the other hand, video generation methods such as [12, 25] often first generate high-resolution videos and then predict actions based on the generated videos. While this hierarchical approach can utilize existing video models, it also introduces significant drawbacks, including slower processing speeds and the propagation of errors from the generated video into action prediction. To address these limitations, we propose UVA, Unified Video and Action Model designed to simultaneously model videos and actions capturing the underlying interactions between visuals and actions to enhance task understanding, while maintaining high-speed action prediction during inference. We propose the following three design choices to achieve this: 1) Unified Latent Video-Action Representation: UVA introduces unified latent representation that integrates both visual and action data. Unlike traditional video generation based policy methods which rely on hierarchical video and action generation, UVA is trained simultaneously with supervision from both video and action data. This enables the model to capture the intricate dynamics shared between the visual and action domains with reduced computational overhead. Utilizing the rich scene information encoded in the latent representation unlocks UVAs superior performance in understanding complex environments and delivering precise action predictions. 2) Decoupled Video-Action Diffusion for Fast Inference: To further enhance efficiency and achieve inference speed comparable to action-only methods, UVA decouples video generation from action prediction. During training, the model employs two lightweight diffusion heads to decode video observations and actions from the unified latent space. At inference, this decoupling allows the system to bypass video generation entirely, directly utilizing the latent representation for fast action prediction. This design enables real-time policy deployment without sacrificing performance, as it still retains the rich representations learned during training from both visual motions and robot action trajectories. 3) Mask Training for Flexibility: The ability to predict both videos and actions through unified representations further unlocks the potential to perform diverse set of functions using masked training. UVA can handle versatile functions that go beyond traditional policy learning by masking inputs and outputs as needed, as illustrated in Figure 1. This versatility enables the model to tackle complex scenarios, such as operating as forward or inverse dynamics model, learning effectively from video-only datasets where action labels are unavailable, or simultaneously performing both low-level control and highlevel planning. We evaluate UVA on seven publicly available benchmarks to assess its diverse capabilities. UVA outperforms or matches state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating particularly strong performance in multi-"

A unified video and action model holds significant promise for robotics, where videos provide rich scene information for action prediction, and actions provide dynamics information for video prediction. However, effectively combining video generation and action prediction remains challenging, and current video generation-based methods struggle to match the performance of direct policy learning in action accuracy and inference speed. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unified Video Action model (UVA), which jointly optimizes video and action predictions to achieve both high accuracy and efficient action inference. The key lies in learning a joint video-action latent representation and decoupling video-action decoding. The joint latent representation bridges the visual and action domains, effectively modeling the relationship between video and action sequences. Meanwhile, the decoupled decoding, powered by two lightweight diffusion heads, enables high-speed action inference by bypassing video generation during inference. Such a unified framework further enables versatile functionality through masked input training. By selectively masking actions or videos, a single model can tackle diverse tasks beyond policy learning, such as forward and inverse dynamics modeling and video generation. Via an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that UVA can serve as a general-purpose solution for a wide range of robotics tasks, such as policy learning, forward/inverse dynamics and video observation prediction, without compromising performance compared to methods tailored for specific applications. Results are best viewed on https://unified-video-action-model.github.io/.
