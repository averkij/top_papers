[ 1 2 5 1 2 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r While advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved the quality of synthetic text data in recent years, synthesizing tabular data has received relatively less attention. We address this disparity with Tabby, simple but powerful post-training modification to the standard Transformer language model architecture, enabling its use for tabular dataset synthesis. Tabby enables the representation of differences across columns using Gated Mixture-of-Experts, with column-specific sets of parameters. Empirically, Tabby results in data quality near or equal to that of real data. By pairing our novel LLM table training technique, Plain, with Tabby, we observe up to 44% improvement in quality over previous methods. We also show that Tabby extends beyond tables to more general structured data, reaching parity with real data on nested JSON dataset as well. From spreadsheets to databases, much of our modern life is encoded in tables. Airplane black boxes, website visitor logs and hospital patient records are just few examples of this versatile modality. Despite widespread use of tabular data and many calls for improved tabular modeling approaches, this type of data has received less attention in deep learning research than images or text [5, 7, 31]. Progress towards realistic tabular data synthesis has encountered several key challenges. First, table columns often exhibit complex interdependencies. Second, many tabular datasets are in fact combination of various modalities, with text, numerical, and nested datatypes (such as JSON or dictionary) possible among the columns in one dataset. Third, although the order of tokens within one column is important, the order "

The precise interpretation of these images significantly enhances the automation of information processes, including text recognition, retrieval, segmentation, and understanding. With the trend towards these tasks unification and the advancement of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), visual foundation models (VFMs) have garnered considerable attention due to their broad capabilities in providing visual understanding for these downstream vision 1 VFM Granularity Dataset #Image #Pairs CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) DINO (Caron et al., 2021) SAM (Kirillov et al., 2023) image-level WIT400M 400M 0.4B image-level pixel-level ImageNet 14M SA1B 11M 1.1B - TokenOCR token-level TokenIT 20M 1.8B Figure 1: For different tasks, previous works select different VFMs from general foundation models (path 1). In contrast, we develop unified token-level foundation model, TokenOCR, specifically tailored for text-image-related tasks (path 2). TokenOCR is trained on substantial self-built dataset, TokenIT, comprising 20 million images and 1.8 billion token-mask pairs. This well-learned model is capable of supplanting other VFMs in related downstream tasks. tasks (Covert et al., 2024). For instance, popular general models CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), DINO (Caron et al., 2021), and SAM (Kirillov et al., 2023) are widely adapted for text-image-related tasks to achieve performance gains through LoRA/adapter tuning (Ye et al., 2024), prompt learning (Yu et al., 2023), and learnable position interpolation technology. Additionally, CLIP and SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023) have also proven effective as visual encoders for MLLMs in concurrent studies (McKinzie et al., 2024; Tong et al., 2024). However, these VFMs, trained with image-level supervision, are not optimal for processing fine-grained dense prediction tasks (Yu et al., 2024), such as document understanding with densely packed and small visual texts. Although several works attempt to incorporate SAM as an additional highresolution encoder (Wei et al., 2025; Fan et al., 2024) or combine other expert models (Lin et al., 2023b), these dual or more complex VFM combinations result in doubling of the number of tokens, which is costly and lack flexibility. Token-level Text Image Foundation Model for Document Understanding Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently almost no fine-grained text image foundation model with token granularity, specifically tailored for extracting robust and general visual text semantic feature representations. In this work, we close the gap and explore the potential of the text image foundation model at large scale. Leveraging the vast amounts of publicly available data, we develop high-quality data production pipeline that constructs the first token-level image text dataset, named TokenIT, comprising 20 million images and 1.8 billion token-mask pairs. Specifically, we begin by extracting text transcriptions and text masks for each sample. Subsequently, we split each text transcription into several tokens (BPE-level subwords) using tokenizer (Chen et al., 2024d) and obtain their corresponding BPE token masks. The number of token-mask pairs ultimately constructed is 4.5 times that of CLIP and 0.7B more than SAM as summarized in Figure 1. Leveraging the self-constructed TokenIT dataset, we further propose the first token-level text image foundation model, named TokenOCR, designed to support wide array of text-image-related downstream tasks. To achieve imageas-text semantic alignment, token-level visual embeddings are aligned with token-level language embeddings for positive token-mask pairs, meanwhile ensuring that negative pairs remain distinct within the embedding space. Specifically, each token-level visual embedding is derived through mean pooling operation applied to the visual image features within corresponding token mask; each token-level language embedding is produced via straightforward token embedding layer, obviating the need for complex text encoder like CLIP. The image-as-text semantic attributes, aligned at the VFM level, effectively bridge the gaps between visual and language modalities. This approach creates unified sequence representation that can be seamlessly integrated into any large language model (LLM) for popular MLLM tasks. Building upon this foundation, we propose documentlevel MLLM, named TokenVL, which further enhances spatially visual-language token alignment at the LLM level for document understanding in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Additionally, we freeze the weights of the TokenOCR model to facilitate other downstream applications, including text segmentation, text retrieval, and end-to-end text recognition tasks. Overall, the main contributions are summarized as follows: 1) The first token-level image text dataset (TokenIT) is proposed, which consi"

Text:"Discrete-Time Hybrid Automata Learning: Legged Locomotion Meets Skateboarding Hang Liu1 1University of Michigan Sangli Teng1 Ben Liu2 Wei Zhang2 Maani Ghaffari1 2Southern University of Science and Technology Corresponding Author: sanglit@umich.edu Website, Code: https://umich-curly.github.io/DHAL/ 5 2 0 M 3 ] . [ 1 2 4 8 1 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r Fig. 1: Demonstration of DHAL performance across various indoor and outdoor terrains, including slopes, carpets, sidewalks, step, and scenarios with additional payloads or disturbance. The controller enables the robot to perform smooth and natural skateboarding motions, with reliable mode identification and transitions under disturbances. AbstractThis paper introduces Discrete-time Hybrid Automata Learning (DHAL), framework using on-policy Reinforcement Learning to identify and execute mode-switching without trajectory segmentation or event function learning. Hybrid dynamical systems, which include continuous flow and discrete mode switching, can model robotics tasks like legged robot locomotion. Model-based methods usually depend on predefined gaits, while model-free approaches lack explicit mode-switching knowledge. Current methods identify discrete modes via segmentation before regressing continuous flow, but learning highdimensional complex rigid body dynamics without trajectory labels or segmentation is challenging open problem. Our approach incorporates beta policy distribution and multi-critic architecture to model contact-guided motions, exemplified by challenging quadrupedal robot skateboard task. We validate our method through simulations and real-world tests, demonstrating robust performance in hybrid dynamical systems. I. INTRODUCTION Legged robots are often regarded as the ideal embodiment of robotic systems, designed to perform wide range of tasks and navigate diverse destinations. Many of these tasks, such as skateboarding and boxing, are inherently contact-guided, involving complex sequences of contact events [1]. D"

While advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved the quality of synthetic text data in recent years, synthesizing tabular data has received relatively less attention. We address this disparity with Tabby, a simple but powerful post-training modification to the standard Transformer language model architecture, enabling its use for tabular dataset synthesis. Tabby enables the representation of differences across columns using Gated Mixture-of-Experts, with column-specific sets of parameters. Empirically, Tabby results in data quality near or equal to that of real data. By pairing our novel LLM table training technique, Plain, with Tabby, we observe up to a 44% improvement in quality over previous methods. We also show that Tabby extends beyond tables to more general structured data, reaching parity with real data on a nested JSON dataset as well.

In recent years, general visual foundation models (VFMs) have witnessed increasing adoption, particularly as image encoders for popular multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). However, without semantically fine-grained supervision, these models still encounter fundamental prediction errors in the context of downstream text-image-related tasks, i.e., perception, understanding and reasoning with images containing small and dense texts. To bridge this gap, we develop TokenOCR, the first token-level visual foundation model specifically tailored for text-image-related tasks, designed to support a variety of traditional downstream applications. To facilitate the pretraining of TokenOCR, we also devise a high-quality data production pipeline that constructs the first token-level image text dataset, TokenIT, comprising 20 million images and 1.8 billion token-mask pairs. Furthermore, leveraging this foundation with exceptional image-as-text capability, we seamlessly replace previous VFMs with TokenOCR to construct a document-level MLLM, TokenVL, for VQA-based document understanding tasks. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenOCR and TokenVL. Code, datasets, and weights will be available at https://token-family.github.io/TokenOCR_project.

"In recent years, general visual foundation models (VFMs) have witnessed increasing adoption, particularly as image encoders for popular multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). However, without semantically fine-grained supervision, these models still encounter fundamental prediction errors in the context of downstream text-image-related tasks, i.e., perception, understanding and reasoning with images containing small and dense texts. To bridge this gap, we develop TokenOCR, the first token-level visual foundation model specifically tailored for text-image-related tasks, designed to support a variety of traditional downstream applications. To facilitate the pretraining of TokenOCR, we also devise a high-quality data production pipeline that constructs the first token-level image text dataset, TokenIT, comprising 20 million images and 1.8 billion token-mask pairs. Furthermore, leveraging this foundation with exceptional image-as-text capability, we seamlessly replace previous VFMs with TokenOCR to construct a document-level MLLM, TokenVL, for VQA-based document understanding tasks. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenOCR and TokenVL. Code, datasets, and weights will be available at https://token-family.github.io/TokenOCR_project."

In recent decades, neuroscientific and psychological research has traced direct relationships between taste and auditory perceptions. This article explores multimodal generative models capable of converting taste information into music, building on this foundational research. We provide a brief review of the state of the art in this field, highlighting key findings and methodologies. We present an experiment in which a fine-tuned version of a generative music model (MusicGEN) is used to generate music based on detailed taste descriptions provided for each musical piece. The results are promising: according the participants' (n=111) evaluation, the fine-tuned model produces music that more coherently reflects the input taste descriptions compared to the non-fine-tuned model. This study represents a significant step towards understanding and developing embodied interactions between AI, sound, and taste, opening new possibilities in the field of generative AI. We release our dataset, code and pre-trained model at: https://osf.io/xs5jy/.

This paper introduces Discrete-time Hybrid Automata Learning (DHAL), a framework using on-policy Reinforcement Learning to identify and execute mode-switching without trajectory segmentation or event function learning. Hybrid dynamical systems, which include continuous flow and discrete mode switching, can model robotics tasks like legged robot locomotion. Model-based methods usually depend on predefined gaits, while model-free approaches lack explicit mode-switching knowledge. Current methods identify discrete modes via segmentation before regressing continuous flow, but learning high-dimensional complex rigid body dynamics without trajectory labels or segmentation is a challenging open problem. Our approach incorporates a beta policy distribution and a multi-critic architecture to model contact-guided motions, exemplified by a challenging quadrupedal robot skateboard task. We validate our method through simulations and real-world tests, demonstrating robust performance in hybrid dynamical systems.
