Text:"Step-GUI Technical Report GELab-Team, StepFun Homepage: https://opengelab.github.io/ Github: https://github.com/stepfun-ai/gelab-zero Huggingface: Step-GUI CollectionsRecent advances in multimodal large language models unlock unprecedented opportunities for GUI automation. However, fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently acquire highquality training data while maintaining annotation reliability? We introduce self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts modelgenerated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10100 lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities. As GUI agent capabilities improve, practical deployment demands standardized interfaces across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy. To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%). Our work advances the development of practical GUI agents and demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in everyday digital interactions. Figure 1 Performance Overview across Heterogeneous GUI Benchmarks. We compare Step-GUI (4B/8B) against leading baselines on five diverse benchmarks covering grounding (ScreenSpotPro, OSWorld-G, MMBench-GUI-L2) and end-to-end agentic tasks (OSWorld, AndroidWorld). End-to-end results use pass@3 metric to mitigate non-model-related failures (e.g., CAPTCHA, VM crashes). Pass@1 results are also shown in different shade of blue. The results demonstrate that Step-GUI-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing open-source and proprietary agents, even surpassing models with much larger parameter counts. 5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 1 3 4 5 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r 1. Introduction The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) unlocks unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, fundamentally transforming how machines process and generate human language. Recent breakthroughs in multimodal large language models Anthropic (2025c); Bai et al. (2025a); Comanici et al. (2025); Guo et al. (2025b); OpenAI (2025a) further extend these capabilities to visual perception and action planning, providing the foundational abilities necessary for GUI automation. These advances enable models to understand complex visual interfaces and reason about appropriate interactions, opening new possibilities for autonomous GUI agents that can assist users in their daily digital tasks. Building on these foundational capabilities, the research community makes significant progress in GUI agent development. Various approaches explore methods for acquiring GUI interaction data Gao et al. (2024); Liu et al. (2025b); Rawles et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2025c), establishing critical data infrastructure for training GUI agents. Several powerful GUI agent models Qin et al. (2025); Wang et al. (2025a); Ye et al. (2025); Zeng et al. (2025) demonstrate impressive capabilities in navigating and manipulating graphical interfaces. However, critical challenge remains: how to efficiently obtain high-quality trajectory and knowledge data to improve agent performance in target domains? Traditional annotation methods suffer from subjectivity and prohibitive costs, limiting the scalability of GUI agent development. To address this challenge, we introduce self-evolving training pipeline centered on the Calibrated Step Reward System (CSRS). While prior work explores self-improvement through data generation via rationalization, self-critique, quality filtering, and offline reinforcement learning Gulcehre et al. (2023); Jung et al. (2023); Madaan et al. (2023); Zelikman et al. (2022), these approaches primarily target single-turn tasks where model-generated annotations can be reliably verified. For multi-turn GUI agents where task execution spans multiple steps, direct modelgenerated annotations are prone to factual errors and hallucinations in the absence of verifiable ground truth. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on model introspection or post-hoc filtering, CSRS anchors LLM-generated dense step-level reasoning to trajectory-level evaluation signals, either automated verification scripts or human annotations, thereby ensuring annotation quality while maintaining scalability. Through trajectory-level calibration and LLM-powered knowledge extraction, CSRS converts model-generated trajectories into high-quality training data, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100 cost reduction compared to traditional step-level annotation. Our progressive three-stage training paradigm orchestrates parallel data flows for novel exploration and strategic knowledge filtering, continuously improving model capabilities across multiple training rounds. On top of this pipeline, we train Step-GUI, family of GUI specialist models (4B, 8B) built upon the Qwen3-VL backbone, and Step-GUI-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance: 80.2% on AndroidWorld, 48.5% on OSWorld, 65% on ScreenShot-Pro, and 89.91%/52.50% on our AndroidDaily benchmark (static/end-to-end). Remarkably, our compact 4B model delivers competitive performance while remaining deployable on consumer-grade hardware, enabling local execution without cloud dependencies. As GUI agents gain enhanced capabilities in visual understanding and autonomous task execution, two fundamental challenges emerge: standardized communication across heterogeneous devices and user privacy protection when processing sensitive data. The fragmentation of development efforts and high integration costs historically suppress innovation in tool ecosystems Qu et al. (2025). To address the standardization challenge, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Anthropic (2023) is proposed as universal standard that defines how agents and tools should 2 communicate, "

Text:"Is Nano Banana Pro Low-Level Vision All-Rounder? Comprehensive Evaluation on 14 Tasks and 40 Datasets Jialong Zuo, Haoyou Deng, Hanyu Zhou, Jiaxin Zhu, Yicheng Zhang, Yiwei Zhang, Yongxin Yan, Kaixing Huang, Weisen Chen, Yongtai Deng, Rui Jin, Nong Sang, Changxin Gao National Key Laboratory of Multispectral Information Intelligent Processing Technology, School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology The rapid evolution of text-to-image generation models has revolutionized visual content creation. While commercial products like Nano Banana Pro have garnered significant attention, their potential as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision challenges remains largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate the critical question: Is Nano Banana Pro Low-Level Vision All-Rounder? We conducted comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 distinct low-level tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets. By utilizing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, we benchmarked Nano Banana Pro against state-of-the-art specialist models. Our extensive analysis reveals distinct performance dichotomy: while Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality, often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models, it lags behind in traditional referencebased quantitative metrics. We attribute this discrepancy to the inherent stochasticity of generative models, which struggle to maintain the strict pixel-level consistency required by conventional metrics. This report identifies Nano Banana Pro as capable zero-shot contender for low-level vision tasks, while highlighting that achieving the high fidelity of domain specialists remains significant hurdle.

Jacobi Forcing is a progressive distillation method that enables efficient parallel decoding of transformer-based models while maintaining performance, significantly reducing inference latency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-token generation has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating transformer-based large model inference. Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/JacobiForcing.

Qwen-Image-Layered decomposes images into semantically disentangled RGBA layers using a diffusion model, enabling independent editing of each layer and improving decomposition quality and consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent visual generative models often struggle with consistency during image editing due to the entangled nature of raster images, where all visual content is fused into a single canvas. In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency. Motivated by this, we propose Qwen-Image-Layered, an end-to-end diffusion model that decomposes a single RGB image into multiple semantically disentangled RGBA layers, enabling inherent editability, where each RGBA layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content. To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) an RGBA-VAE to unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) a VLD-MMDiT (Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) a Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of high-quality multilayer training images, we build a pipeline to extract and annotate multilayer images from Photoshop documents (PSD). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing.

"Qwen-Image-Layered decomposes images into semantically disentangled RGBA layers using a diffusion model, enabling independent editing of each layer and improving decomposition quality and consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent visual generative models often struggle with consistency during image editing due to the entangled nature of raster images, where all visual content is fused into a single canvas. In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency. Motivated by this, we propose Qwen-Image-Layered, an end-to-end diffusion model that decomposes a single RGB image into multiple semantically disentangled RGBA layers, enabling inherent editability, where each RGBA layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content. To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) an RGBA-VAE to unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) a VLD-MMDiT (Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) a Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of high-quality multilayer training images, we build a pipeline to extract and annotate multilayer images from Photoshop documents (PSD). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing. Our code and models are released on https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Image-Layered{https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Image-Layered}"

DiffusionVL, a family of diffusion vision language models derived from autoregressive models through fine-tuning, achieves performance improvements and faster inference speeds compared to existing models.  					AI-generated summary 				 In recent multimodal research, the diffusion paradigm has emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm (AR), owing to its unique decoding advantages. However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup. The model and code are released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionVL.

A self-evolving training pipeline with the Calibrated Step Reward System and GUI-MCP protocol improve GUI automation efficiency, accuracy, and privacy in real-world scenarios.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in multimodal large language models unlock unprecedented opportunities for GUI automation. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently acquire high-quality training data while maintaining annotation reliability? We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities. As GUI agent capabilities improve, practical deployment demands standardized interfaces across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy. To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, a benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%). Our work advances the development of practical GUI agents and demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in everyday digital interactions.

A resynthesis framework enhances deepfake detection by verifying authenticity with low false positive rates and robustness against efficient adversaries, supporting multiple modalities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generative models can synthesize highly realistic content, so-called deepfakes, that are already being misused at scale to undermine digital media authenticity. Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable for two reasons: (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (e.g., with memorized samples), leading to an unbounded false positive rate (FPR); and (ii) detection lacks robustness, as adversaries can adapt to known detectors with near-perfect accuracy using minimal computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. We make two key contributions focusing on the high-precision, low-recall setting against efficient (i.e., compute-restricted) adversaries. First, we demonstrate that our calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable, low FPRs. Second, we show that our method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets. Our approach supports multiple modalities and leverages state-of-the-art inversion techniques.

Nano Banana Pro excels in subjective visual quality across low-level vision tasks without fine-tuning but struggles with traditional reference-based quantitative metrics due to generative model stochasticity.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid evolution of text-to-image generation models has revolutionized visual content creation. While commercial products like Nano Banana Pro have garnered significant attention, their potential as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision challenges remains largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate the critical question: Is Nano Banana Pro a Low-Level Vision All-Rounder? We conducted a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 distinct low-level tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets. By utilizing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, we benchmarked Nano Banana Pro against state-of-the-art specialist models. Our extensive analysis reveals a distinct performance dichotomy: while Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality, often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models, it lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics. We attribute this discrepancy to the inherent stochasticity of generative models, which struggle to maintain the strict pixel-level consistency required by conventional metrics. This report identifies Nano Banana Pro as a capable zero-shot contender for low-level vision tasks, while highlighting that achieving the high fidelity of domain specialists remains a significant hurdle.

The paper proposes SAGE, a multi-turn reasoning system for video that mimics human behavior, using synthetic data and reinforcement learning to improve performance on long videos.  					AI-generated summary 				 As humans, we are natural any-horizon reasoners, i.e., we can decide whether to iteratively skim long videos or watch short ones in full when necessary for a given task. With this in mind, one would expect video reasoning models to reason flexibly across different durations. However, SOTA models are still trained to predict answers in a single turn while processing a large number of frames, akin to watching an entire long video, requiring significant resources. This raises the question: Is it possible to develop performant any-horizon video reasoning systems? Inspired by human behavior, we first propose SAGE, an agent system that performs multi-turn reasoning on long videos while handling simpler problems in a single turn. Secondly, we introduce an easy synthetic data generation pipeline using Gemini-2.5-Flash to train the orchestrator, SAGE-MM, which lies at the core of SAGE. We further propose an effective RL post-training recipe essential for instilling any-horizon reasoning ability in SAGE-MM. Thirdly, we curate SAGE-Bench with an average duration of greater than 700 seconds for evaluating video reasoning ability in real-world entertainment use cases. Lastly, we empirically validate the effectiveness of our system, data, and RL recipe, observing notable improvements of up to 6.1% on open-ended video reasoning tasks, as well as an impressive 8.2% improvement on videos longer than 10 minutes.

"The paper proposes SAGE, a multi-turn reasoning system for video that mimics human behavior, using synthetic data and reinforcement learning to improve performance on long videos.  					AI-generated summary 				 As humans, we are natural any-horizon reasoners, i.e., we can decide whether to iteratively skim long videos or watch short ones in full when necessary for a given task. With this in mind, one would expect video reasoning models to reason flexibly across different durations. However, SOTA models are still trained to predict answers in a single turn while processing a large number of frames, akin to watching an entire long video, requiring significant resources. This raises the question: Is it possible to develop performant any-horizon video reasoning systems? Inspired by human behavior, we first propose SAGE, an agent system that performs multi-turn reasoning on long videos while handling simpler problems in a single turn.

Pixio, an enhanced masked autoencoder, demonstrates competitive performance across various downstream tasks using pixel-space self-supervised learning, outperforming latent-space approaches.  					AI-generated summary 				 At the most basic level, pixels are the source of the visual information through which we perceive the world. Pixels contain information at all levels, ranging from low-level attributes to high-level concepts. Autoencoders represent a classical and long-standing paradigm for learning representations from pixels or other raw inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that autoencoder-based self-supervised learning remains competitive today and can produce strong representations for downstream tasks, while remaining simple, stable, and efficient. Our model, codenamed "Pixio", is an enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE) with more challenging pre-training tasks and more capable architectures. The model is trained on 2B web-crawled images with a self-curation strategy with minimal human curation. Pixio performs competitively across a wide range of downstream tasks in the wild, including monocular depth estimation (e.g., Depth Anything), feed-forward 3D reconstruction (i.e., MapAnything), semantic segmentation, and robot learning, outperforming or matching DINOv3 trained at similar scales. Our results suggest that pixel-space self-supervised learning can serve as a promising alternative and a complement to latent-space approaches.

Resampling Forcing is introduced as a teacher-free framework to train autoregressive video diffusion models with improved temporal consistency using self-resampling and history routing.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autoregressive video diffusion models hold promise for world simulation but are vulnerable to exposure bias arising from the train-test mismatch. While recent works address this via post-training, they typically rely on a bidirectional teacher model or online discriminator. To achieve an end-to-end solution, we introduce Resampling Forcing, a teacher-free framework that enables training autoregressive video models from scratch and at scale. Central to our approach is a self-resampling scheme that simulates inference-time model errors on history frames during training. Conditioned on these degraded histories, a sparse causal mask enforces temporal causality while enabling parallel training with frame-level diffusion loss. To facilitate efficient long-horizon generation, we further introduce history routing, a parameter-free mechanism that dynamically retrieves the top-k most relevant history frames for each query. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to distillation-based baselines while exhibiting superior temporal consistency on longer videos owing to native-length training.
