Text:"Draft with Diffusion, Verify with Autoregressive Models Zicong Cheng 1 2 3 Guo-Wei Yang 2 Jia Li 1 Zhijie Deng 3 Meng-Hao Guo(cid:66) 1 Shi-Min Hu 1 5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 6 7 1 5 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r Abstract Efficiency, as critical practical challenge for LLM-driven agentic and reasoning systems, is increasingly constrained by the inherent latency of autoregressive (AR) decoding. Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through draftverify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. Together, these factors cause limited speedups. In this paper, we show that diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models. To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments. Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3. Moreover, on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B, DEER attains 5.54 speedup, while EAGLE-3 achieves only 2.41. Code, model, demo, etc, will be available at https://czc726.github.io/DEER/ 1.

Text:"SCOPE: Prompt Evolution for Enhancing Agent Effectiveness Zehua Pei 1 Hui-Ling Zhen 2 Shixiong Kai 2 Sinno Jialin Pan 1 Yunhe Wang 2 Mingxuan Yuan 2 Bei Yu 1 5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 4 7 3 5 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r aLarge Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in environments that generate massive, dynamic contexts. However, critical bottleneck remains: while agents have access to this context, their static prompts lack the mechanisms to manage it effectively, leading to recurring Corrective and Enhancement failures. To address this capability gap, we introduce SCOPE (Self-evolving Context Optimization via Prompt Evolution). SCOPE frames context management as an online optimization problem, synthesizing guidelines from execution traces to automatically evolve the agents prompt. We propose DualStream mechanism that balances tactical specificity (resolving immediate errors) with strategic generality (evolving long-term principles). Furthermore, we introduce Perspective-Driven Exploration to maximize strategy coverage, increasing the likelihood that the agent has the correct strategy for any given task. Experiments on the HLE benchmark show that SCOPE improves task success rates from 14.23% to 38.64% without human intervention. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/ JarvisPei/SCOPE. 1. Introduction The core functionality of Large Language Model (LLM) agent is to perceive and react to context. Whether interpreting users ambiguous instruction, analyzing screen full of code, or deciphering traceback from failed tool execution, the agents success depends entirely on its ability to process this incoming information and decide on the next action. As agents are tasked with increasingly complex problems, the volume and complexity of this context grow exponentially, such as in deep research (OpenAI, 2025; Google, 2025; Wei et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025b; Team et al., 2025) and agentic coding (Anthropic, 2025; Jimenez 1The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR 2Noahs Ark Lab, Huawei, Hong Kong SAR. Preprint. 1 Figure 1. SCOPE enables prompt evolution for enhanced agent effectiveness. SCOPE significantly outperforms static agents and existing methods on the HLE benchmark; success rate improves as strategic guidelines accumulate over episodes. et al., 2023). Consequently, the definition of capable agent is shifting from one that simply knows facts to one that can effectively manage and navigate complex contexts. However, current research in agentic systems has predominantly focused on the availability of context rather than how agents manage it. Innovations such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) or infinite context windows (Team et al., 2024) focus on feeding more data to the agent. We argue that there is fundamental gap between possessing context and dealing with context. Even recent test-time learning methods like DC (Suzgun et al., 2025) or ACE (Zhang et al., 2025a), which attempt to bridge this gap, operate at task-level granularity and cannot adapt during execution. Without an evolved internal strategy to interpret these signals, an agent flooded with context is merely an agent flooded with noise. Figure 2 illustrates this gap: agents receive actionable information in their context but fail to leverage it effectively. In this paper, we first substantiate this gap through an extensive analysis of over 1.5 million lines of execution logs from standard agents. Our observations reveal that static SCOPE: Prompt Evolution for Enhancing Agent Effectiveness Figure 2. Two failure modes and how SCOPE addresses them. (a) Corrective Failure: The agent treats errors as generic alarms, entering error loops despite the error message containing the solution. SCOPE synthesizes corrective guideline and integrates it into the prompt, enabling recovery. (b) Enhancement Failure: The agent persists with suboptimal strategies (e.g., single-term search) when no error is raised. SCOPE proactively analyzes successful traces to synthesize optimization guidelines. prompts fail to adapt to dynamic context needs, leading to two distinct failure modes. First, agents suffer from Corrective Failures: when errors occur, agents treat error logs as generic alarms (signals to retry) rather than actionable feedback containing the solution. In severe cases, agents fabricate data to proceed rather than managing uncertainty. Second, agents exhibit Enhancement Failures: even when operating without errors, agents miss opportunities to optimize, persisting with suboptimal strategies because their static prompts lack the mechanism to learn from execution patterns. These failures are magnified in modern agentic systems, which are composed of specialized agents (e.g., coder, browser, analyzer) engaging in long, multi-turn interactions. The complexity of these systems and the sheer volume of execution steps render static, one-size-fits-all prompts obsolete. Yet this structure also creates an opportunity: since agents are invoked repeatedly, their prompts can evolve online. To address this gap, we propose SCOPE (Self-evolving Context Optimization via Prompt Evolution), framework that transforms context management from manual engineering task into an automatic optimization process. SCOPE operates on the insight that the agents own execution trace serves as the perfect training signal. Through Trace-Based Guideline Synthesis, SCOPE analyzes these traces online to generate guidelines that teach the agent how to handle specific context patterns. Dual-Stream Routing mechanism balances tactical updates (immediate error correction) with strategic updates (long-term principles), ensuring the agent not only survives the current task but becomes smarter for future ones. Finally, Perspective-Driven Exploration evolves multiple parallel prompts guided by distinct perspectives (e.g., Efficiency vs. Thoroughness), maximizing strategy coverage. As shown in Figure 1, SCOPE significantly outperforms static agents and existing methods, with success rate improving as guidelines accumulate. Our contributions are as follows: We systematically study agent failures in modern agentic systems. We identify two failure modes, i.e. Corrective Failures and Enhancement Failures, supported by analysis of over 1.5 million lines of execution logs. We propose SCOPE, framework that synthesizes guidelines from execution traces, routes them via dualstream (tactical/strategic), and explores diverse strategies thr"

TacThru-UMI demonstrates efficacy across fine-grained and contact-rich tasks requiring precise multimodal coordination (right). AbstractRobotic manipulation requires both rich multimodal perception and effective learning frameworks to handle complex real-world tasks. See-Through-Skin (STS) sensors, which combine tactile and visual perception, offer promising sensing capabilities, while modern imitation learning provides powerful tools for policy acquisition. However, existing STS designs lack simultaneous multimodal perception and suffer from unreliable tactile tracking. Furthermore, integrating these rich multimodal signals into learning-based manipulation pipelines remains an open challenge. We introduce TacThru, an STS sensor enabling simultaneous visual perception and robust tactile signal extraction, and TacThru-UMI, an imitation learning framework that leverages these multimodal signals for manipulation.

Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model, detects and explains visual artifacts in AI-generated videos using a novel dataset and two-stage training strategy, outperforming existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 The misuse of AI-driven video generation technologies has raised serious social concerns, highlighting the urgent need for reliable AI-generated video detectors. However, most existing methods are limited to binary classification and lack the necessary explanations for human interpretation. In this paper, we present Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model (MLLM) that identifies human-perceivable visual artifacts in AI-generated videos and leverages them as grounded evidence for both detection and explanation. To support this objective, we construct ViF-CoT-4K for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which represents the first large-scale AI-generated video artifact dataset with fine-grained human annotations. We then develop a two-stage training strategy that systematically enhances our model's spatio-temporal artifact perception, explanation capability, and detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Skyra, we introduce ViF-Bench, a benchmark comprising 3K high-quality samples generated by over ten state-of-the-art video generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyra surpasses existing methods across multiple benchmarks, while our evaluation yields valuable insights for advancing explainable AI-generated video detection.

"Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model, detects and explains visual artifacts in AI-generated videos using a novel dataset and two-stage training strategy, outperforming existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 The misuse of AI-driven video generation technologies has raised serious social concerns, highlighting the urgent need for reliable AI-generated video detectors. However, most existing methods are limited to binary classification and lack the necessary explanations for human interpretation. In this paper, we present Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model (MLLM) that identifies human-perceivable visual artifacts in AI-generated videos and leverages them as grounded evidence for both detection and explanation. To support this objective, we construct ViF-CoT-4K for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which represents the first large-scale AI-generated video artifact dataset with fine-grained human annotations. We then develop a two-stage training strategy that systematically enhances our model's spatio-temporal artifact perception, explanation capability, and detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Skyra, we introduce ViF-Bench, a benchmark comprising 3K high-quality samples generated by over ten state-of-the-art video generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyra surpasses existing methods across multiple benchmarks, while our evaluation yields valuable insights for advancing explainable AI-generated video detection."

VABench is a benchmark framework for evaluating audio-video generation models, covering text-to-audio-video, image-to-audio-video, and stereo audio-video tasks with 15 evaluation dimensions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in video generation have been remarkable, enabling models to produce visually compelling videos with synchronized audio. While existing video generation benchmarks provide comprehensive metrics for visual quality, they lack convincing evaluations for audio-video generation, especially for models aiming to generate synchronized audio-video outputs. To address this gap, we introduce VABench, a comprehensive and multi-dimensional benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of synchronous audio-video generation. VABench encompasses three primary task types: text-to-audio-video (T2AV), image-to-audio-video (I2AV), and stereo audio-video generation. It further establishes two major evaluation modules covering 15 dimensions. These dimensions specifically assess pairwise similarities (text-video, text-audio, video-audio), audio-video synchronization, lip-speech consistency, and carefully curated audio and video question-answering (QA) pairs, among others. Furthermore, VABench covers seven major content categories: animals, human sounds, music, environmental sounds, synchronous physical sounds, complex scenes, and virtual worlds. We provide a systematic analysis and visualization of the evaluation results, aiming to establish a new standard for assessing video generation models with synchronous audio capabilities and to promote the comprehensive advancement of the field.

The Universal Reasoning Model enhances Universal Transformers with short convolution and truncated backpropagation to improve reasoning performance on ARC-AGI tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Universal transformers (UTs) have been widely used for complex reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI and Sudoku, yet the specific sources of their performance gains remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically analyze UTs variants and show that improvements on ARC-AGI primarily arise from the recurrent inductive bias and strong nonlinear components of Transformer, rather than from elaborate architectural designs. Motivated by this finding, we propose the Universal Reasoning Model (URM), which enhances the UT with short convolution and truncated backpropagation. Our approach substantially improves reasoning performance, achieving state-of-the-art 53.8% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 1 and 16.0% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 2.

G2RL, a gradient-guided reinforcement learning framework, enhances exploration in large language models by leveraging the model's own update geometry, leading to improved performance on various reasoning benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning has become essential for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet current exploration mechanisms remain fundamentally misaligned with how these models actually learn. Entropy bonuses and external semantic comparators encourage surface level variation but offer no guarantee that sampled trajectories differ in the update directions that shape optimization. We propose G2RL, a gradient guided reinforcement learning framework in which exploration is driven not by external heuristics but by the model own first order update geometry. For each response, G2RL constructs a sequence level feature from the model final layer sensitivity, obtainable at negligible cost from a standard forward pass, and measures how each trajectory would reshape the policy by comparing these features within a sampled group. Trajectories that introduce novel gradient directions receive a bounded multiplicative reward scaler, while redundant or off manifold updates are deemphasized, yielding a self referential exploration signal that is naturally aligned with PPO style stability and KL control. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AMC, AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, MMLUpro) on Qwen3 base 1.7B and 4B models, G2RL consistently improves pass@1, maj@16, and pass@k over entropy based GRPO and external embedding methods. Analyzing the induced geometry, we find that G2RL expands exploration into substantially more orthogonal and often opposing gradient directions while maintaining semantic coherence, revealing that a policy own update space provides a far more faithful and effective basis for guiding exploration in large language model reinforcement learning.

DEER framework uses diffusion large language models for efficient speculative decoding, overcoming the limitations of autoregressive drafters with better speed and draft quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Efficiency, as a critical practical challenge for LLM-driven agentic and reasoning systems, is increasingly constrained by the inherent latency of autoregressive (AR) decoding. Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through a draft-verify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to a progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. Together, these factors cause limited speedups. In this paper, we show that a diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models. To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs a two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments. Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3. Moreover, on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B, DEER attains a 5.54x speedup, while EAGLE-3 achieves only 2.41x. Code, model, demo, etc, will be available at https://czc726.github.io/DEER/

A benchmark evaluates the performance of vision-language models on understanding long-context information compressed into dense visual representations, revealing significant limitations in capturing long-term dependencies.  					AI-generated summary 				 The computational and memory overheads associated with expanding the context window of LLMs severely limit their scalability. A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.We comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs.

The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs."

"A benchmark evaluates the performance of vision-language models on understanding long-context information compressed into dense visual representations, revealing significant limitations in capturing long-term dependencies.  					AI-generated summary 				 The computational and memory overheads associated with expanding the context window of LLMs severely limit their scalability. A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory.

SCOPE enhances LLM agents' context management through prompt evolution, improving task success rates in dynamic environments without human intervention.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in environments that generate massive, dynamic contexts. However, a critical bottleneck remains: while agents have access to this context, their static prompts lack the mechanisms to manage it effectively, leading to recurring Corrective and Enhancement failures. To address this capability gap, we introduce SCOPE (Self-evolving Context Optimization via Prompt Evolution). SCOPE frames context management as an online optimization problem, synthesizing guidelines from execution traces to automatically evolve the agent's prompt. We propose a Dual-Stream mechanism that balances tactical specificity (resolving immediate errors) with strategic generality (evolving long-term principles). Furthermore, we introduce Perspective-Driven Exploration to maximize strategy coverage, increasing the likelihood that the agent has the correct strategy for any given task. Experiments on the HLE benchmark show that SCOPE improves task success rates from 14.23\% to 38.64\% without human intervention. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/JarvisPei/SCOPE.

TacThru-UMI, a system combining a TacThru sensor with a Transformer-based Diffusion Policy, achieves superior performance in robotic manipulation tasks by integrating simultaneous multimodal perception.  					AI-generated summary 				 Robotic manipulation requires both rich multimodal perception and effective learning frameworks to handle complex real-world tasks. See-through-skin (STS) sensors, which combine tactile and visual perception, offer promising sensing capabilities, while modern imitation learning provides powerful tools for policy acquisition. However, existing STS designs lack simultaneous multimodal perception and suffer from unreliable tactile tracking. Furthermore, integrating these rich multimodal signals into learning-based manipulation pipelines remains an open challenge. We introduce TacThru, an STS sensor enabling simultaneous visual perception and robust tactile signal extraction, and TacThru-UMI, an imitation learning framework that leverages these multimodal signals for manipulation. Our sensor features a fully transparent elastomer, persistent illumination, novel keyline markers, and efficient tracking, while our learning system integrates these signals through a Transformer-based Diffusion Policy. Experiments on five challenging real-world tasks show that TacThru-UMI achieves an average success rate of 85.5%, significantly outperforming the baselines of alternating tactile-visual (66.3%) and vision-only (55.4%). The system excels in critical scenarios, including contact detection with thin and soft objects and precision manipulation requiring multimodal coordination. This work demonstrates that combining simultaneous multimodal perception with modern learning frameworks enables more precise, adaptable robotic manipulation.
