[ 1 0 9 1 3 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r WAY: Estimation of Vessel Destination in Worldwide AIS Trajectory JIN SOB KIM HYUN JOON PARK WOOSEOK SHIN Korea University, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea DONGIL PARK SeaVantage, Seoul 06119, Republic of Korea SUNG WON HAN Korea University, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea Abstract The Automatic Identification System (AIS) has recorded near-real-time vessel monitoring data over the years, paving the way for data-driven maritime surveillance methods; concurrently, the data suffer from unrefined, reliability issues and irregular intervals. In this paper, we address the problem of vessel destination estimation by exploiting the global-scope AIS data. We propose differentiated data-driven approach recasting long sequence of port-to-port international vessel trajectories as nested sequence structure. Based on spatial grids, this approach mitigates the spatio-temporal bias of AIS data while preserving the detailed resolution of the original. Further, we propose novel deep learning architecture (WAY) that is designed to effectively process the reformulated trajectory and perform the long-term estimation of the vessel destination ahead of arrival with horizon of days to weeks. WAY comprises trajectory representation layer and channel-aggregative sequential processing (CASP) blocks. The representation layer produces the multi-channel vector sequence output based on each kinematic and non-kinematic feature collected from AIS data. Then CASP blocks include multi-headed channeland self-attention architectures, where each processes aggregation information delivery respectively. Then, taskand sequential specialized learning technique, Gradient Dropout (GD), is also suggested for adopting many-to-many training along the trajectory progression on single labels. The technique prevents surge of biased feedback by blocking the gradient flow stochastically using the condition depending on the length of training samples. Experimental results on "

IC-Effect, an instruction-guided DiT-based framework, synthesizes complex video VFX effects while preserving spatial and temporal consistency using a two-stage training strategy and spatiotemporal sparse tokenization.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose IC-Effect, an instruction-guided, DiT-based framework for few-shot video VFX editing that synthesizes complex effects (\eg flames, particles and cartoon characters) while strictly preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Video VFX editing is highly challenging because injected effects must blend seamlessly with the background, the background must remain entirely unchanged, and effect patterns must be learned efficiently from limited paired data. However, existing video editing models fail to satisfy these requirements. IC-Effect leverages the source video as clean contextual conditions, exploiting the contextual learning capability of DiT models to achieve precise background preservation and natural effect injection. A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation. We also release a paired VFX editing dataset spanning 15 high-quality visual styles. Extensive experiments show that IC-Effect delivers high-quality, controllable, and temporally consistent VFX editing, opening new possibilities for video creation.

A novel deep learning architecture, WAY, uses nested sequence structures and spatial grids for accurate long-term vessel destination estimation from AIS data, incorporating CASP blocks and Gradient Dropout for improved performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 The Automatic Identification System (AIS) enables data-driven maritime surveillance but suffers from reliability issues and irregular intervals. We address vessel destination estimation using global-scope AIS data by proposing a differentiated approach that recasts long port-to-port trajectories as a nested sequence structure. Using spatial grids, this method mitigates spatio-temporal bias while preserving detailed resolution. We introduce a novel deep learning architecture, WAY, designed to process these reformulated trajectories for long-term destination estimation days to weeks in advance. WAY comprises a trajectory representation layer and Channel-Aggregative Sequential Processing (CASP) blocks. The representation layer generates multi-channel vector sequences from kinematic and non-kinematic features. CASP blocks utilize multi-headed channel- and self-attention for aggregation and sequential information delivery. Additionally, we propose a task-specialized Gradient Dropout (GD) technique to enable many-to-many training on single labels, preventing biased feedback surges by stochastically blocking gradient flow based on sample length. Experiments on 5-year AIS data demonstrate WAY's superiority over conventional spatial grid-based approaches regardless of trajectory progression. Results further confirm that adopting GD leads to performance gains. Finally, we explore WAY's potential for real-world application through multitask learning for ETA estimation.

MMSI-Video-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs, revealing significant gaps between human and AI performance and highlighting challenges in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, and cross-video correspondence.  					AI-generated summary 				 Spatial understanding over continuous visual input is crucial for MLLMs to evolve into general-purpose assistants in physical environments. Yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark that holistically assesses the progress toward this goal. In this work, we introduce MMSI-Video-Bench, a fully human-annotated benchmark for video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs. It operationalizes a four-level framework, Perception, Planning, Prediction, and Cross-Video Reasoning, through 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 clips from 25 datasets and in-house videos. Each item is carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise, unambiguous grounding. Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains. We expect our benchmark to establish a solid testbed for advancing video-based spatial intelligence.

A novel framework, Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP), enhances language model interpretability and robustness by guiding the model to capture fine-grained class distinctions and combining with existing attribution methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Small language models (SLMs) are widely used in tasks that require low latency and lightweight deployment, particularly classification. As interpretability and robustness gain increasing importance, explanation-guided learning has emerged as an effective framework by introducing attribution-based supervision during training; however, deriving general and reliable attribution priors remains a significant challenge. Through an analysis of representative attribution methods in classification settings, we find that although these methods can reliably highlight class-relevant tokens, they often focus on common keywords shared by semantically similar classes. Because such classes are already difficult to distinguish under standard training, these attributions provide insufficient discriminative cues, limiting their ability to improve model differentiation. To overcome this limitation, we propose Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP), a novel attribution prior extraction framework that guides language models toward capturing fine-grained class distinctions and producing more salient, discriminative attribution priors. Building on this idea, we further introduce CAP Hybrid, which combines priors from CAP with those from existing attribution techniques to form a more comprehensive and balanced supervisory signal. By aligning a model's self-attribution with these enriched priors, our approach encourages the learning of diverse, decision-relevant features. Extensive experiments in full-data, few-shot, and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that our method consistently enhances both interpretability and robustness.
