To address this, we present Fast-SAM3D, training-free framework that dynamically aligns computation with instantaneous generation complexity. Our approach integrates three heterogeneity-aware mechanisms: (1) Modality-Aware Step Caching to decouple structural evolution from sensitive layout updates; (2) Joint Spatiotemporal Token Carving to concentrate refinement on high-entropy regions; and (3) Spectral-Aware Token Aggregation to adapt decoding resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fast-SAM3D delivers up to 2.67 end-to-end speedup with negligible fidelity loss, establishing new Pareto frontier for efficient single-view 3D generation. Our code is released in https://github.com/ wlfeng0509/Fast-SAM3D. Fast-SAM3D: 3Dfy Anything in Images but Faster 1. Introduction Unified 3D reconstruction models (Hunyuan3D et al., 2025; Xiang et al., 2025b; Wu et al., 2024) that recover highquality object-centric 3D assets from minimal user input are emerging as key foundation for scalable 3D perception and content creation. Among them, SAM3D (Chen et al., 2025) is distinctive in that it performs mask-conditioned, openworld multi-object reconstruction directly from single scene image, enabling practical reconstruction of arbitrary objects without category-specific training. However, this strong reconstruction quality and generalization comes with substantial computation overhead and severely hinders realworld deployment. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation into the inference characteristics of SAM3D. Our profiling reveals that latency is not uniformly distributed but dominated by three coupled components: the dual-stage iterative denoising (structure and texture) and the combinatorial complexity of decoding long token sequences. Crucially, we find that straightforward applications of generic acceleration techniques like uniform step skipping (Liu et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025) or random token pruning (Yang et al., 2025b; Bolya & Hoffman, 2023) are brittle for SAM3D. This arises from the multi-level heterogeneity inherent to the pipeline: (i) the kinematic distinctiveness between stable shape evolution and sensitive layout updates, where uniform skipping induces pose drift; (ii) the intrinsic sparsity of texture refinement, where uniform compute wastes resources on low-entropy surfaces; and (iii) the spectral variance across geometries, where instance-agnostic downsampling erases high-frequency details on complex shapes. These observations imply that accelerating SAM3D requires departure from isolated optimizations toward model-aware design. To this end, we present Fast-SAM3D, training-free, end-to-end acceleration framework derived from unified principle: allocate computation non-uniformly, matching stage-specific difficulty and instance-specific complexity. Fast-SAM3D instantiates this principle via three plug-andplay modules that seamlessly integrate into the inference pipeline: (1) Modality-Aware Step Caching for the structure generator, which disentangles caching rules to accelerate shape evolution while anchoring sensitive layout attributes; (2) Joint Spatiotemporal Token Carving for the latent generator, which eliminates redundancy by concentrating refinement compute solely on dynamically selected active regions; and (3) Spectral-Aware Token Aggregation for mesh decoding, which utilizes geometric spectral entropy to aggressively compress simple shapes while preserving details for complex geometries. Our contributions are summarized as follows: Systematic Profiling. We provide the first modulewise characterization of the SAM3D pipeline, identifying key latency sources and revealing why generic acceleration strategies fail due to kinematic and spectral heterogeneity. Holistic Framework. We propose Fast-SAM3D, unified, training-free framework that systematically accelerates the geometry, texture, and decoding stages by exploiting their specific redundancies. Adaptive Components. We design three lightweight modules: modality-aware caching, spatiotemporal token carving, and spectral-aware aggregation. Together, deliver substantial latency reduction while preserving reconstruction quality. Strong empirical results.

Early reconstruction methods focused on deterministically regressing representations like voxels (Xu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2025c), point clouds (Mildenhall et al., 2021), or meshes (Worchel et al., 2022). While recent feed-forward transformers (Yang et al., 2025a; Wang et al., 2025b; 2024a) achieve rapid inference, but often struggles to high-fidelity generation.

Text:"Qingyuan Wu 1 2 * Yuhui Wang 3 * Simon Sinong Zhan 4 Yanning Dai 3 Shilong Deng 5 Sarra Habchi 2 Qi Zhu 4 Matthias Galle 2 Chao HuangReinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) has emerged as critical paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Most existing RLVR methods, such as GRPO and its variants, ensure stable updates by constraining policy divergence through clipping likelihood ratios. This paper introduces unified clipping framework that characterizes existing methods via general notion of policy divergence, encompassing both likelihood ratios and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences and extending to alternative measures. The framework provides principled foundation for systematically analyzing how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. We further identify the KL3 estimator, variancereduced Monte Carlo estimator of the KL divergence, as key policy divergence constraint. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, promoting stronger exploration while retaining the simplicity of GRPO-style methods. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization. 6 2 0 2 5 ] .

Introduction Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Kaelbling et al., 1996; Sutton & Barto, 2018) has served as pivotal training paradigm in decision-making problems (Tesauro, 1994; Silver et al., 2016; Mnih et al., 2013; Berner et al., 2019), and has re- *Equal contribution 1University of Southampton 2Cohere 3KAUST 4Northwestern University 5University of Liverpool. Correspondence to: Qingyuan Wu <qingyuan.wu@soton.ac.uk>. Preprint. 1 cently been playing central role in advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Lambert et al., 2024). RL provides an efficient and general training framework for LLMs, enabling optimization over complex, nondifferentiable objectives that extend beyond direct supervised learning from human data. This capability is particularly critical for real-world tasks such as code generation (Jain et al., 2024), mathematical reasoning (Zhang et al., 2024; Cobbe et al., 2021), and dialogue alignment (Chiang et al., 2024). Current RL methodologies for LLMs, particularly in RL with Verified Reward (RLVR) (Lambert et al., 2024) settings, predominantly rely on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017). PPO ensures training stability through the ratio-based clipping mechanism, aiming to approximate the trust-region constraint of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) (Schulman et al., 2015a). Recently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024) has emerged as memory-efficient alternative for training large-scale LLMs by using group-normalized returns as the advantage baselines, thus eliminating the need to maintain separate value function. Like PPO, GRPO and its variants (Yu et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025b) rely on the ratio-based clipping to ensure stable policy updates. Despite their success, the reliance on ratio-based clipping constitutes specific and potentially restrictive design choice within the broader landscape of policy optimization. While these methods aim to ensure stable updates by constraining policy divergences through clipping likelihood ratios, recent studies (Cui et al., 2025; Park et al., 2025) reveal that both training exploration and evaluation performance are highly sensitive to the specific definition and implementation of policy divergence constraints. Although different variants of the ratio-based clipping mechanism (Yu et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025b) have been proposed, principled understanding of how different policy divergence measures and corresponding constraints affect the trade-off between exploration and stability remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, this paper first introduces unified clipping framework that characterizes existing clipping methods under general notion of policy divergence. This unified clipping framework provides foundational perspective Unified Framework for Rethinking Policy Divergence Measures in GRPO for analyzing various policy divergence constraints, encompassing both likelihood ratios and KullbackLeibler (KL) divergences. Furthermore, we identify that the KL3 estimator (Schulman, 2020) serves as the pivotal policy divergence constraint under our framework. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping. Based on these observations, we propose Approximate Trust Region-based GRPO (ATR-GRPO). Unlike standard symmetric ratio-based clipping, ATR-GRPO leverages the KL3 estimator to actively steer exploration by reallocating probability mass toward high-confidence actions, all while maintaining the computational efficiency of GRPO. Comprehensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KL3 estimator consistently improves training stability and final performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We introduce unified clipping framework for policy optimization that unifies existing policy divergence constraints and can be extended to arbitrary alternative measures. We identify the KL3 estimator as an effective policy divergence constraint, establish its connection to ratiobased constraints, and theoretically show that it promotes stronger exploration than existing alternatives. Building on these insights, we develop ATR-GRPO, which exhibits improved exploration dynamics while retaining the simplicity of existing methods. We empirically show that ATR-GRPO enhances learning stability and achieves performance competitive with various SOTA baselines. 2. Related Work RL for LLMs. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been established as the standard paradigm for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs), such as RLVR (Lambert et al., 2024). PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) utilizes clipped surrogate objective to ensure stable policy updates. However, PPO requires training separate critic model, which can be prohibitive for large-scale reasoning tasks. To mitigate these memory con"

Fast-SAM3D addresses slow inference in 3D reconstruction by dynamically adapting computation to varying complexity through heterogeneity-aware mechanisms that improve efficiency without sacrificing quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 SAM3D enables scalable, open-world 3D reconstruction from complex scenes, yet its deployment is hindered by prohibitive inference latency. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation into its inference dynamics, revealing that generic acceleration strategies are brittle in this context. We demonstrate that these failures stem from neglecting the pipeline's inherent multi-level heterogeneity: the kinematic distinctiveness between shape and layout, the intrinsic sparsity of texture refinement, and the spectral variance across geometries. To address this, we present Fast-SAM3D, a training-free framework that dynamically aligns computation with instantaneous generation complexity. Our approach integrates three heterogeneity-aware mechanisms: (1) Modality-Aware Step Caching to decouple structural evolution from sensitive layout updates; (2) Joint Spatiotemporal Token Carving to concentrate refinement on high-entropy regions; and (3) Spectral-Aware Token Aggregation to adapt decoding resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fast-SAM3D delivers up to 2.67times end-to-end speedup with negligible fidelity loss, establishing a new Pareto frontier for efficient single-view 3D generation. Our code is released in https://github.com/wlfeng0509/Fast-SAM3D.

Policy mirror descent with mean approximation addresses challenges in training large language models by using adaptive regularization for more stable and efficient reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Policy mirror descent (PMD) provides a principled framework for reinforcement learning (RL) by iteratively solving KL-regularized policy improvement subproblems. While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--χ^2 regularizer. This additional χ^2 regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.

"Policy mirror descent with mean approximation addresses challenges in training large language models by using adaptive regularization for more stable and efficient reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Policy mirror descent (PMD) provides a principled framework for reinforcement learning (RL) by iteratively solving KL-regularized policy improvement subproblems. While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--χ^2 regularizer. This additional χ^2 regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi."

A unified framework for reinforcement learning with verified reward is presented, characterized by policy divergence measures including likelihood ratios and KL divergences, with empirical validation showing improved training stability and performance through the KL3 estimator.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a critical paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Most existing RLVR methods, such as GRPO and its variants, ensure stable updates by constraining policy divergence through clipping likelihood ratios. This paper introduces a unified clipping framework that characterizes existing methods via a general notion of policy divergence, encompassing both likelihood ratios and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences and extending to alternative measures. The framework provides a principled foundation for systematically analyzing how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. We further identify the KL3 estimator, a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator of the KL divergence, as a key policy divergence constraint. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, promoting stronger exploration while retaining the simplicity of GRPO-style methods. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization.
