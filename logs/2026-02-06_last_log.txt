However, most existing MLLMs perform reasoning primarily with textual CoT, which limits their effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches inject fixed number of continuous hidden states as visual thoughts into the reasoning process and improve visual performance, but often at the cost of degraded text-based logical reasoning. We argue that the core limitation lies in rigid, pre-defined reasoning pattern that cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries. We introduce SwimBird, reasoning-switchable MLLM that dynamically switches among three reasoning modes conditioned on the input: (1) text-only reasoning, (2) vision-only reasoning (continuous hidden states as visual thoughts), and (3) interleaved visiontext reasoning. To enable this capability, we adopt hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design systematic reasoning-mode curation strategy to construct SwimBird-SFT-92K, diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset covering all three reasoning patterns. By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks. Experiments across diverse benchmarks covering textual reasoning and challenging visual understanding demonstrate that SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art results and robust gains over prior fixed-pattern multimodal reasoning meth"

Text:"Semantic Search over 9 Million Mathematical Theorems Luke Alexander * 1 2 Eric Leonen * 1 3 Sophie Szeto * 1 2 4 Artemii Remizov 1 5 Ignacio Tejeda 1 2 Giovanni Inchiostro 1 2 Vasily Ilin 1 2 6 2 0 2 5 ] I . [ 1 6 1 2 5 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aSearching for mathematical results remains difficult: most existing tools retrieve entire papers, while mathematicians and theorem-proving agents often seek specific theorem, lemma, or proposition that answers query. While semantic search has seen rapid progress, its behavior on large, highly technical corpora such as researchlevel mathematical theorems remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce and study semantic theorem retrieval at scale over unified corpus of 9.2 million theorem statements extracted from arXiv and seven other sources, representing the largest publicly available corpus of human-authored, research-level theorems. We represent each theorem with short naturallanguage description as retrieval representation and systematically analyze how representation context, language model choice, embedding model, and prompting strategy affect retrieval quality. On curated evaluation set of theoremsearch queries written by professional mathematicians, our approach substantially improves both theorem-level and paper-level retrieval compared to existing baselines, demonstrating that semantic theorem search is feasible and effective at web scale. The theorem search tool is available at this link, and the dataset is available at this link. ing for both human mathematicians and automated proof systems (Polu & Sutskever, 2020; Yang et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). researcher proving new result must first determine whether the statement already exists in the literature, and similarly, an AI agent generating formal proofs benefits from retrieving relevant lemmas to guide its search. Yet most existing tools Google Scholar, arXiv, and even modern LLMs with web access operate at the level of entire documents, forcing users to manually scan papers when they seek specific statement. This gap is increasingly significant. arXiv hosts over 2.4 million papers, including more than 690,000 in mathematics (Ginsparg, 1994). study of over 14,000 withdrawn arXiv preprints found that 2.5% were retracted because the authors results already appeared in prior literature (Rao et al., 2024). For example, Popescu-Pampu (2007), Zhang (2012), and Shahryari (2020) were withdrawn after discovering their main results had been previously established. AI systems face the same problem: the Erdos Problems Project documented cases where AI tools solved open problems that had been established decades earlier (Erdos & Newman, 1977; Wirsing & Schwarz, 1961; Klarner, 1966) underscoring the need for theorem-level search. In this work, we construct corpus of over 9 million theorem statements from arXiv, the Stacks Project, ProofWiki, and five other sources, and study semantic retrieval at scale. We represent each theorem using natural-language slogan generated by an LLM, then embed slogans and queries into shared semantic space. Our main contributions are: 1.

We analyze how the context, LLM choice, embedding model, and prompting strategy affect retrieval. Notably, we find that embedding theorems via natural-language slogans significantly outperforms embedding their raw LATEX formulations. 3. State-of-the-art retrieval. On 111 queries from professional mathematicians, we achieve 45.0% Hit@20 Theorem Search at the theorem level, outperforming ChatGPT 5.2 with search (19.8%) and Gemini 3 Pro (27.0%). For paperlevel retrieval, we achieve 56.8% Hit@20 compared to 37.8% for Google Search.

The dataset is available at huggingface.co/datasets/uw-mathai/theorem-search-dataset. datasheet for our dataset is provided in Appendix A. 2. Related Work Mathematical Information Retrieval. Early MathIR work focused on formula-level retrieval, with the NTCIR Math Tasks (Aizawa et al., 2014; Zanibbi et al., 2016) establishing benchmarks for formula search over arXiv and Wikipedia. The ARQMath shared tasks (Mansouri et al., 2022) extended this to mathematical question answering over Math Stack Exchange. recent survey (Dadure et al., 2024) notes that while formula retrieval has progressed, semantic understanding of mathematical statements remains an open challenge the gap our work addresses. Dense Retrieval and LLM-Augmented Search. Dense Passage Retrieval (Karpukhin et al., 2020) showed that dualencoder architectures can outperform sparse methods like BM25. Sentence-BERT (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019) enabled efficient semantic similarity via Siamese networks, while E5 (Wang et al., 2022), Qwen3-Embedding (Zhang et al., 2025), and Gemma Embedding (Vera et al., 2025) have pushed embedding quality further. ColBERT (Khattab & Zaharia, 2020) introduced late interaction for fine-grained token matching. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) combines retrieval with language model generation, enabling systems to ground responses in retrieved documents. These advances underpin our approach, though mathematical text poses unique challenges due to symbolic notation. Search for Formal Mathematics. LeanSearch (Gao et al., 2024) provides semantic search over Mathlib4s 230,000+ theorems by generating natural-language descriptions and using dense retrieval. ReProver (Yang et al., 2023) uses retrieval-augmented generation to select premises during proof search, and"

Abstract Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable collective intelligence, wherein multi-agent memory serves as pivotal mechanism for continual adaptation. However, existing multi-agent memory designs remain constrained by two fundamental bottlenecks: (i) memory homogenization arising from the absence of role-aware customization, and (ii) information overload induced by excessively fine-grained memory entries. To address these limitations, we propose LatentMem, learnable multi-agent memory framework designed to customize agent-specific memories in token-efficient manner. Specifically, LatentMem comprises an experience bank that stores raw interaction trajectories in lightweight form, and memory composer that synthesizes compact latent memories conditioned on retrieved experience and agent-specific contexts. Further, we introduce Latent Memory Policy Optimization (LMPO), which propagates task-level optimization signals through latent memories to the composer, encouraging it to produce compact and high-utility representations. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and mainstream MAS frameworks show that LatentMem achieves performance gain of up to 19.36% over vanilla settings and consistently outperforms existing memory architectures, without requiring any modifications to the underlying frameworks. 1.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Test-Time Correction (TTC), training-free alternative. Specifically, TTC utilizes the initial frame as stable reference anchor to calibrate intermediate stochastic states along the sampling trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various distilled models, extending generation lengths with negligible overhead while matching the quality of resource-intensive training-based methods on 30-second benchmarks. Pathwise Test-Time Correction for Autoregressive Long Video Generation 1. Introduction Video generation (Lu et al., 2025; Yesiltepe et al., 2025; Hong et al., 2023; Jia et al., 2025b) has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion-based generative models (Kong et al., 2024; Wan et al., 2025; Hong et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2025a; Peebles & Xie, 2023; Rombach et al., 2022), which now enable the high-quality synthesis of complex motion (Zhu et al., 2024; Hu, 2024) and visual appearance (Guo et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025a). However, scaling these diffusion priors to extended video sequences remains formidable challenge. Beyond the escalating computational costs associated with longer contexts, maintaining temporal coherence over extended horizons is difficult without incurring excessive latency, thereby limiting their deployment in real-time applications. To overcome these limitations, recent studies (Yin et al., 2025b; Huang et al., 2025d) have shifted from bidirectional modeling to step-distilled autoregressive generation, enabling true real-time video synthesis. However, these methods remain constrained by cascading error accumulation: since each frame is conditioned on prior outputs, initial inaccuracies compound over time, resulting in temporal drift and long-horizon degradation. While recent extensions (Yi et al., 2025; Cui et al., 2026) like Rolling Forcing (Liu et al., 2025b), LongLive (Yang et al., 2025), Self-Forcing++ (Cui et al., 2025) , and WorldPlay (Sun et al., 2025) have achieved minute-level consistency through sink mechanisms and windowed DMD retraining, they necessitate substantial computational overhead for model fine-tuning. Consequently, pivotal question arises: Can we improve the stability of autoregressive video generation purely at inference time, bypassing the need for retraining the base model? Test-Time Optimization (TTO) (Wang et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2020) has emerged as compelling alternative for enhancing video quality without the need for retraining. However, while effective for short-video synthesis (Yu et al., 2025b; Eyring et al., 2025), our toy experiments reveal that scaling TTO to long-horizon autoregressive generation faces dual bottleneck consisting of the inherent difficulty in defining reward functions for long-range consistency and the extreme optimization sensitivity of distilled models. We observe that in these distilled models, even infinitesimal test-time gradients often trigger reward collapse and fail to mitigate cumulative error. Therefore, we propose Test-Time Correction (TTC), which is training-free framework that shifts the paradigm from parameter-space optimization to sampling-space stochastic intervention. TTC is grounded in the insight that few-step distilled samplers are inherently stochastic as they perturb intermediate states with injected noise. This property implies that intermediate predictions are not fixed outcomes but rather malleable latent states that can be rectified by subsequent diffusion steps to align with Figure 2. Comparison of sampling strategies. The Original Path suffers from error accumulation, while the Sink-based Path collapses into Sink Point (dynamic collapse). In contrast, our TTC strategy avoids these failures by employing reference-conditioned denoising and explicit Re-noising, effectively steering the trajectory away from the sink to preserve target distribution. the global initial context while preserving the underlying sampling distribution. Specifically, as shown in Figure 2, TTC applies small number of correction steps along the stochastic sampling path, only after the global structure has stabilized. This delay prevents the generation from falling into sink-collapse (Cui et al., 2026), phenomenon where newly generated frames repeatedly regress toward the sink frames instead of evolving naturally. At these chosen steps in the sampling path, TTC performs reference-conditioned denoising by utilizing the initial frame context to anchor corrected clean prediction. Then, this corrected state is re-noised back to the variance level corresponding to the current timestep, which ensures that the intervention remains compatible with the expected noise distribution. By integrating correction into the stochastic sampling path of the autoregressive diffusion process rather than directly replacing the denoised prediction, this mechanism suppresses long-term error accumulation and temporal drift without retraining, while preserving highfidelity temporal coherence over extended durations. In this work, we show that long-horizon stability in autoregressive video generation can be achieved through test-time intervention alone. Our method suppresses error accumulation with negligible computational overhead, without requiring any retraining. As result,"

Text:"UniAudio 2.0: Unified Audio Language Model with Text-Aligned Factorized Audio Tokenization Dongchao Yang 1 Yuanyuan Wang 1 Dading Chong 2 Songxiang Liu 2 Xixin Wu 1 Helen MengWe study two foundational problems in audio language models: (1) how to design an audio tokenizer that can serve as an intermediate representation for both understanding and generation; and (2) how to build an audio foundation model that generalizes in few-shot and zero-shot settings, analogous to large language models. To this end, we make the following two contributions. First, we propose ReasoningCodec, discrete audio codec that factorizes audio into (i) reasoning tokens, which encode text-aligned, high-level analysis and planning representations for audio understanding and hierarchical generation, and (ii) reconstruction tokens, which encode semanticrich acoustic cues for high-fidelity waveform reconstruction. This design achieves understanding performance comparable to strong continuous representations while improving generation quality and reconstruction fidelity over prior discrete tokenizers. Second, we introduce unified autoregressive architecture for text and audio, together with multi-stage training and multi-task data construction. Using this framework, we train UniAudio 2.0 on 100B text tokens and 60B audio tokens. Across wide range of speech, sound, and music tasks, UniAudio 2.0 performs competitively on indomain evaluations and demonstrates strong fewshot and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

Introduction Large language models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) have demonstrated remarkable success by unifying diverse language tasks under single autoregressive framework. Inspired by this paradigm, recent research has 1The Chinese University of Hong Kong, China 2Independent Helen Meng <hmCorrespondence to: Researcher. meng@se.cuhk.edu.hk>. Preprint. February 6, 2026. 1 applied similar modeling principles to the audio domain, such as LM-based audio generation tasks (Borsos et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Kharitonov et al., 2023), LMbased audio understanding tasks (Chu et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024), cross-modal interaction (Defossez et al., 2024; Ding et al., 2025). Despite rapid progress, however, current audio language models still fall short of the generalization, scalability, and task versatility exhibited by their text counterparts. We argue that this limitation primarily stems from three fundamental challenges: the design of audio representations, the architecture of unified autoregressive models and the construction of large-scale multi-task training data. On the representation side, existing approaches largely fall into two categories. Continuous representations, such as self-supervised representations (SSL features) (Hsu et al., 2021; Radford et al., 2023), are effective for perception and understanding tasks but are difficult to integrate into autoregressive audio generation due to the difficulty of modeling high-dimensional features. In contrast, discrete audio codecs (Zeghidour et al., 2021; Defossez et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023b; 2024a) enable efficient generation and scalable modeling, yet their tokens mainly encode low-level acoustic details and lack text-aligned, highlevel abstractions for understanding. In this study, we focus on discrete tokenizers due to their scalability and compatibility with unified text-audio modeling objectives. To address their limited abstraction capability, we introduce ReasoningCodec, novel audio codec that explicitly factorizes audio representations into reasoning tokens and reconstruction tokens. Reasoning tokens encode text-aligned, high-level analysis and planning representations that support audio understanding and hierarchical generation, while reconstruction tokens preserve semantic content and fine-grained acoustics for high-fidelity waveform reconstruction. On the architectural side, most existing audio language models adopt naive unified autoregressive transformer (Zeng et al., 2024; Defossez et al., 2024; Ding et al., 2025) inherited from text LLMs, in which all layers indiscriminately process both text and audio tokens. Although such design is simple and convenient, we argue that it is suboptimal for audio foundation models even with improved tokenization, because: (1) discrete audio tokens remain lossy, and propagating them uniformly across all layers can limit perceptual Unified Audio Language Model with Text-Aligned Factorized Audio Tokenization Figure 1. The overview of the proposed UniAudio 2.0. abstraction and reasoning for audio understanding; and (2) directly aligning text and audio tokens throughout all transformer layers is highly challenging and can lead to rapid forgetting of pre-trained textual knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose unified autoregressive architecture with functional layer specialization. Rather than treating all transformer layers uniformly, we conceptually partition the model into three stages: the lower layers act as audio understanding experts that focus on perceptual abstraction and reasoning over audio; the intermediate layers serve as cross-modal experts to align and integrate text and audio, initialized from pre-trained LLM (e.g., LLaMA3.2 3B) to preserve rich textual knowledge; and the upper layers act as audio generation experts that specialize in modeling fine-grained acoustics. This design maintains specialized inductive biases for understanding and generation while operating within unified autoregressive framework. On the data side, we curate large-scale open-sourced audio corpora spanning speech, sound, and music, and unify them into diverse set of audio-centric tasks covering both understanding and generation. Furthermore, inspired by sequential training in LVMs (Bai et al., 2023), we introduce the concept of auditory sentences: long-context sequences composed of multiple segments that are linked by semantic or acoustic relations, where each segment can be an audio span, text span (e.g., caption), or their paired form. Auditory sentences essentially serve as unified task constructor. By organizing multiple related segments into single longcontext sequence, an auditory sentence naturally induces variety of task forms, including within-segment modeling (e.g., ASR/captioning), cross-segment dependency tracking (e"

RISE-Video presents a novel benchmark for evaluating text-image-to-video synthesis models based on cognitive reasoning rather than visual fidelity, using a multi-dimensional metric system and automated LMM-based evaluation.  					AI-generated summary 				 While generative video models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, their capacity to internalize and reason over implicit world rules remains a critical yet under-explored frontier. To bridge this gap, we present RISE-Video, a pioneering reasoning-oriented benchmark for Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) synthesis that shifts the evaluative focus from surface-level aesthetics to deep cognitive reasoning. RISE-Video comprises 467 meticulously human-annotated samples spanning eight rigorous categories, providing a structured testbed for probing model intelligence across diverse dimensions, ranging from commonsense and spatial dynamics to specialized subject domains. Our framework introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol consisting of four metrics: Reasoning Alignment, Temporal Consistency, Physical Rationality, and Visual Quality. To further support scalable evaluation, we propose an automated pipeline leveraging Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to emulate human-centric assessment. Extensive experiments on 11 state-of-the-art TI2V models reveal pervasive deficiencies in simulating complex scenarios under implicit constraints, offering critical insights for the advancement of future world-simulating generative models.

Research analyzes RLVR algorithms' impact on response length in LLMs and VLMs, proposing LUSPO to eliminate length bias and improve reasoning performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent applications of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant success in enhancing reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation. Building upon these theoretical findings, we propose the Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm. Specifically, we rectify the length bias inherent in Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), rendering its loss function unbiased with respect to response length and thereby resolving the issue of response length collapse. We conduct extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks and multimodal reasoning scenarios, where LUSPO consistently achieves superior performance. Empirical results demonstrate that LUSPO represents a novel, state-of-the-art optimization strategy compared to existing methods such as GRPO and GSPO.

Dataset distillation method that balances informativeness and utility through game-theoretic and gradient-based optimization techniques, achieving improved performance on ImageNet-1K.  					AI-generated summary 				 Dataset Distillation (DD) seeks to create a compact dataset from a large, real-world dataset. While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm. These components ensure that the distilled dataset is both informative and utility-optimized. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 6.1\% performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach on ImageNet-1K dataset using ResNet-18.

"Dataset distillation method that balances informativeness and utility through game-theoretic and gradient-based optimization techniques, achieving improved performance on ImageNet-1K.  					AI-generated summary 				 Dataset Distillation (DD) seeks to create a compact dataset from a large, real-world dataset. While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm. These components ensure that the distilled dataset is both informative and utility-optimized. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 6.1\% performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach on ImageNet-1K dataset using ResNet-18."

SwimBird is a reasoning-switchable multimodal large language model that dynamically selects between text-only, vision-only, and interleaved vision-text reasoning modes based on input queries, achieving superior performance on both textual and visual tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in multimodal perception and reasoning by bridging vision and language. However, most existing MLLMs perform reasoning primarily with textual CoT, which limits their effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches inject a fixed number of continuous hidden states as "visual thoughts" into the reasoning process and improve visual performance, but often at the cost of degraded text-based logical reasoning. We argue that the core limitation lies in a rigid, pre-defined reasoning pattern that cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries. We introduce SwimBird, a reasoning-switchable MLLM that dynamically switches among three reasoning modes conditioned on the input: (1) text-only reasoning, (2) vision-only reasoning (continuous hidden states as visual thoughts), and (3) interleaved vision-text reasoning. To enable this capability, we adopt a hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design a systematic reasoning-mode curation strategy to construct SwimBird-SFT-92K, a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset covering all three reasoning patterns. By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks. Experiments across diverse benchmarks covering textual reasoning and challenging visual understanding demonstrate that SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art results and robust gains over prior fixed-pattern multimodal reasoning methods.

Large-scale semantic theorem retrieval system demonstrates superior performance over existing baselines using a 9.2 million theorem corpus with systematic analysis of representation context, language model choice, and embedding strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Searching for mathematical results remains difficult: most existing tools retrieve entire papers, while mathematicians and theorem-proving agents often seek a specific theorem, lemma, or proposition that answers a query. While semantic search has seen rapid progress, its behavior on large, highly technical corpora such as research-level mathematical theorems remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce and study semantic theorem retrieval at scale over a unified corpus of 9.2 million theorem statements extracted from arXiv and seven other sources, representing the largest publicly available corpus of human-authored, research-level theorems. We represent each theorem with a short natural-language description as a retrieval representation and systematically analyze how representation context, language model choice, embedding model, and prompting strategy affect retrieval quality. On a curated evaluation set of theorem-search queries written by professional mathematicians, our approach substantially improves both theorem-level and paper-level retrieval compared to existing baselines, demonstrating that semantic theorem search is feasible and effective at web scale.

LatentMem is a learnable multi-agent memory framework that customizes agent-specific memories through latent representations, improving performance in multi-agent systems without modifying underlying frameworks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable collective intelligence, wherein multi-agent memory serves as a pivotal mechanism for continual adaptation. However, existing multi-agent memory designs remain constrained by two fundamental bottlenecks: (i) memory homogenization arising from the absence of role-aware customization, and (ii) information overload induced by excessively fine-grained memory entries. To address these limitations, we propose LatentMem, a learnable multi-agent memory framework designed to customize agent-specific memories in a token-efficient manner. Specifically, LatentMem comprises an experience bank that stores raw interaction trajectories in a lightweight form, and a memory composer that synthesizes compact latent memories conditioned on retrieved experience and agent-specific contexts. Further, we introduce Latent Memory Policy Optimization (LMPO), which propagates task-level optimization signals through latent memories to the composer, encouraging it to produce compact and high-utility representations. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and mainstream MAS frameworks show that LatentMem achieves a performance gain of up to 19.36% over vanilla settings and consistently outperforms existing memory architectures, without requiring any modifications to the underlying frameworks.

"LatentMem is a learnable multi-agent memory framework that customizes agent-specific memories through latent representations, improving performance in multi-agent systems without modifying underlying frameworks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable collective intelligence, wherein multi-agent memory serves as a pivotal mechanism for continual adaptation. However, existing multi-agent memory designs remain constrained by two fundamental bottlenecks: (i) memory homogenization arising from the absence of role-aware customization, and (ii) information overload induced by excessively fine-grained memory entries. To address these limitations, we propose LatentMem, a learnable multi-agent memory framework designed to customize agent-specific memories in a token-efficient manner. Specifically, LatentMem comprises an experience bank that stores raw interaction trajectories in a lightweight form, and a memory composer that synthesizes compact latent memories conditioned on retrieved experience and agent-specific contexts. Further, we introduce Latent Memory Policy Optimization (LMPO), which propagates task-level optimization signals through latent memories to the composer, encouraging it to produce compact and high-utility representations. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and mainstream MAS frameworks show that LatentMem achieves a performance gain of up to 19.36% over vanilla settings and consistently outperforms existing memory architectures, without requiring any modifications to the underlying frameworks."

Context Forcing addresses student-teacher mismatch in long video generation by using a long-context teacher to guide long-rollout students through a Slow-Fast Memory architecture that extends context length beyond 20 seconds.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent approaches to real-time long video generation typically employ streaming tuning strategies, attempting to train a long-context student using a short-context (memoryless) teacher. In these frameworks, the student performs long rollouts but receives supervision from a teacher limited to short 5-second windows. This structural discrepancy creates a critical student-teacher mismatch: the teacher's inability to access long-term history prevents it from guiding the student on global temporal dependencies, effectively capping the student's context length. To resolve this, we propose Context Forcing, a novel framework that trains a long-context student via a long-context teacher. By ensuring the teacher is aware of the full generation history, we eliminate the supervision mismatch, enabling the robust training of models capable of long-term consistency. To make this computationally feasible for extreme durations (e.g., 2 minutes), we introduce a context management system that transforms the linearly growing context into a Slow-Fast Memory architecture, significantly reducing visual redundancy. Extensive results demonstrate that our method enables effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds -- 2 to 10 times longer than state-of-the-art methods like LongLive and Infinite-RoPE. By leveraging this extended context, Context Forcing preserves superior consistency across long durations, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on various long video evaluation metrics.

Reinforcement World Model Learning enables LLM-based agents to better anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics through self-supervised training that aligns simulated and real-world state transitions in embedding space.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in language-centric tasks. However, in agentic settings, LLMs often struggle to anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics, highlighting the need for world-modeling capabilities in LLM-based agents. We propose Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method that learns action-conditioned world models for LLM-based agents on textual states using sim-to-real gap rewards. Our method aligns simulated next states produced by the model with realized next states observed from the environment, encouraging consistency between internal world simulations and actual environment dynamics in a pre-trained embedding space. Unlike next-state token prediction, which prioritizes token-level fidelity (i.e., reproducing exact wording) over semantic equivalence and can lead to model collapse, our method provides a more robust training signal and is empirically less susceptible to reward hacking than LLM-as-a-judge. We evaluate our method on ALFWorld and τ^2 Bench and observe significant gains over the base model, despite being entirely self-supervised. When combined with task-success rewards, our method outperforms direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points on ALFWorld and τ^2 Bench respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.

CatRAG addresses limitations in retrieval-augmented generation by introducing a query-adaptive framework that improves multi-hop reasoning through symbolic anchoring, dynamic edge weighting, and key-fact passage enhancement.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have shifted from simple vector similarity to structure-aware approaches like HippoRAG, which leverage Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture multi-hop dependencies. However, these methods suffer from a "Static Graph Fallacy": they rely on fixed transition probabilities determined during indexing. This rigidity ignores the query-dependent nature of edge relevance, causing semantic drift where random walks are diverted into high-degree "hub" nodes before reaching critical downstream evidence. Consequently, models often achieve high partial recall but fail to retrieve the complete evidence chain required for multi-hop queries. To address this, we propose CatRAG, Context-Aware Traversal for robust RAG, a framework that builds on the HippoRAG 2 architecture and transforms the static KG into a query-adaptive navigation structure. We introduce a multi-faceted framework to steer the random walk: (1) Symbolic Anchoring, which injects weak entity constraints to regularize the random walk; (2) Query-Aware Dynamic Edge Weighting, which dynamically modulates graph structure, to prune irrelevant paths while amplifying those aligned with the query's intent; and (3) Key-Fact Passage Weight Enhancement, a cost-efficient bias that structurally anchors the random walk to likely evidence. Experiments across four multi-hop benchmarks demonstrate that CatRAG consistently outperforms state of the art baselines. Our analysis reveals that while standard Recall metrics show modest gains, CatRAG achieves substantial improvements in reasoning completeness, the capacity to recover the entire evidence path without gaps. These results reveal that our approach effectively bridges the gap between retrieving partial context and enabling fully grounded reasoning.

Large language models can be trained more efficiently by transferring knowledge from later training phases to earlier layers during initial training, achieving faster convergence and improved performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable empirical success through scaling model and data size, pretraining has become increasingly critical yet computationally prohibitive, hindering rapid development. Despite the availability of numerous pretrained LLMs developed at significant computational expense, a fundamental real-world question remains underexplored: Can we leverage existing small pretrained models to accelerate the training of larger models? In this paper, we propose a Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm that enables LLMs to explicitly learn later knowledge in earlier steps and earlier layers. The core idea is to guide the early layers of an LLM during early training using representations from the late layers of a pretrained (i.e. late training phase) model. We identify two key mechanisms that drive LET's effectiveness: late-to-early-step learning and late-to-early-layer learning. These mechanisms significantly accelerate training convergence while robustly enhancing both language modeling capabilities and downstream task performance, enabling faster training with superior performance. Extensive experiments on 1.4B and 7B parameter models demonstrate LET's efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, when training a 1.4B LLM on the Pile dataset, our method achieves up to 1.6times speedup with nearly 5\% improvement in downstream task accuracy compared to standard training, even when using a pretrained model with 10times fewer parameters than the target model.

DeR2 presents a controlled evaluation framework for assessing language models' document-grounded reasoning capabilities by isolating reasoning from retrieval and toolchain decisions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.

FastVMT accelerates video motion transfer by addressing computational redundancies in Diffusion Transformer architecture through localized attention masking and gradient reuse optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video motion transfer aims to synthesize videos by generating visual content according to a text prompt while transferring the motion pattern observed in a reference video. Recent methods predominantly use the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. To achieve satisfactory runtime, several methods attempt to accelerate the computations in the DiT, but fail to address structural sources of inefficiency. In this work, we identify and remove two types of computational redundancy in earlier work: motion redundancy arises because the generic DiT architecture does not reflect the fact that frame-to-frame motion is small and smooth; gradient redundancy occurs if one ignores that gradients change slowly along the diffusion trajectory. To mitigate motion redundancy, we mask the corresponding attention layers to a local neighborhood such that interaction weights are not computed unnecessarily distant image regions. To exploit gradient redundancy, we design an optimization scheme that reuses gradients from previous diffusion steps and skips unwarranted gradient computations. On average, FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup without degrading the visual fidelity or the temporal consistency of the generated videos.

Для устранения первого типа применяется локальная маска внимания (attention masking), которая ограничивает взаимодействие только соседними областями изображения.

ProAct enhances LLM agents' long-horizon planning by combining supervised fine-tuning with search-derived trajectories and a Monte-Carlo critic for improved policy optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle in interactive environments requiring long-horizon planning, primarily due to compounding errors when simulating future states. To address this, we propose ProAct, a framework that enables agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through a two-stage training paradigm. First, we introduce Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD), where the agent undergoes supervised fine-tuning on trajectories derived from environment-based search. By compressing complex search trees into concise, causal reasoning chains, the agent learns the logic of foresight without the computational overhead of inference-time search. Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy. Notably, a 4B parameter model trained with ProAct outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments.

Test-Time Correction addresses error accumulation in distilled autoregressive diffusion models for long-video synthesis by using initial frames as reference anchors to calibrate stochastic states during sampling.  					AI-generated summary 				 Distilled autoregressive diffusion models facilitate real-time short video synthesis but suffer from severe error accumulation during long-sequence generation. While existing Test-Time Optimization (TTO) methods prove effective for images or short clips, we identify that they fail to mitigate drift in extended sequences due to unstable reward landscapes and the hypersensitivity of distilled parameters. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Test-Time Correction (TTC), a training-free alternative. Specifically, TTC utilizes the initial frame as a stable reference anchor to calibrate intermediate stochastic states along the sampling trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various distilled models, extending generation lengths with negligible overhead while matching the quality of resource-intensive training-based methods on 30-second benchmarks.

"Test-Time Correction addresses error accumulation in distilled autoregressive diffusion models for long-video synthesis by using initial frames as reference anchors to calibrate stochastic states during sampling.  					AI-generated summary 				 Distilled autoregressive diffusion models facilitate real-time short video synthesis but suffer from severe error accumulation during long-sequence generation. While existing Test-Time Optimization (TTO) methods prove effective for images or short clips, we identify that they fail to mitigate drift in extended sequences due to unstable reward landscapes and the hypersensitivity of distilled parameters. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Test-Time Correction (TTC), a training-free alternative. Specifically, TTC utilizes the initial frame as a stable reference anchor to calibrate intermediate stochastic states along the sampling trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various distilled models, extending generation lengths with negligible overhead while matching the quality of resource-intensive training-based methods on 30-second benchmarks."

BABE is a biology-focused benchmark designed to evaluate AI systems' ability to perform experimental reasoning and causal inference similar to practicing scientists.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has expanded their capabilities from basic dialogue to advanced scientific reasoning. However, existing benchmarks in biology often fail to assess a critical skill required of researchers: the ability to integrate experimental results with contextual knowledge to derive meaningful conclusions. To address this gap, we introduce BABE(Biology Arena BEnchmark), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the experimental reasoning capabilities of biological AI systems. BABE is uniquely constructed from peer-reviewed research papers and real-world biological studies, ensuring that tasks reflect the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of actual scientific inquiry. BABE challenges models to perform causal reasoning and cross-scale inference. Our benchmark provides a robust framework for assessing how well AI systems can reason like practicing scientists, offering a more authentic measure of their potential to contribute to biological research.

Researchers developed a discrete audio codec called ReasoningCodec that separates audio into reasoning and reconstruction tokens for improved understanding and generation, and created UniAudio 2.0, a unified autoregressive model trained on large-scale text and audio data that shows strong performance across various audio tasks and generalizes well in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.  					AI-generated summary 				 We study two foundational problems in audio language models: (1) how to design an audio tokenizer that can serve as an intermediate representation for both understanding and generation; and (2) how to build an audio foundation model that generalizes in few-shot and zero-shot settings, analogous to large language models. To this end, we make the following two contributions. First, we propose ReasoningCodec, a discrete audio codec that factorizes audio into (i) reasoning tokens, which encode text-aligned, high-level analysis and planning representations for audio understanding and hierarchical generation, and (ii) reconstruction tokens, which encode semantic-rich acoustic cues for high-fidelity waveform reconstruction. This design achieves understanding performance comparable to strong continuous representations while improving generation quality and reconstruction fidelity over prior discrete tokenizers. Second, we introduce a unified autoregressive architecture for text and audio, together with multi-stage training and multi-task data construction. Using this framework, we train UniAudio 2.0 on 100B text tokens and 60B audio tokens. Across a wide range of speech, sound, and music tasks, UniAudio 2.0 performs competitively on in-domain evaluations and demonstrates strong few-shot and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.
