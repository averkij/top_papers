Text:"2026-2-5 Steering LLMs via Scalable Interactive Oversight Enyu Zhou1, Zhiheng Xi1, Long Ma1, Zhihao Zhang1, Shihan Dou1, Zhikai Lei2, Guoteng Wang2 Rui Zheng2, Hang Yan2, Tao Gui1,3, Qi Zhang1, Xuanjing Huang1 1Fudan University 2Shanghai Qiji Zhifeng Co., Ltd. 3Shanghai Innovation Institute eyzhou23@m.fudan.edu.cn, {tgui,xjhuang}@fudan.edu.cn As Large Language Models increasingly automate complex, long-horizon tasks such as vibe coding, supervision gap has emerged. While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, framework that decomposes complex intent into recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving 54% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales. 1. Introduction Rapid progress in Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning and long-horizon planning has empowered models to tackle increasingly complex tasks with longer decision chains (Cai et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025). salient example is vibe coding, where users describe high-level software requirements in natural language, and the AI handles the implementation (Ge et al., 2025; Karpathy, 2025).

However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance. We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training. Figure 1 Reinforced Attention Learning formulates internal attention distributions as policy. Unlike traditional methods that optimize next-token probabilities (what to generate), our approach prioritizes the selective allocation of information (where to focus). By optimizing for the advantage, the model explores high-reward attention policy that effectively isolates salient information from dense contexts. 1.

Text:"Beyond Fixed Frames: Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenization Luca Della Libera 1 2 Cem Subakan 3 1 2 Mirco Ravanelli 1 2 6 2 0 2 4 ] . [ 2 4 7 1 3 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r Abstract Neural audio codecs are at the core of modern conversational speech technologies, converting continuous speech into sequences of discrete tokens that can be processed by LLMs. However, existing codecs typically operate at fixed frame rates, allocating tokens uniformly in time and producing unnecessarily long sequences. In this work, we introduce DyCAST, Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer that enables variable-frame-rate tokenization through soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling. DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs. Code and checkpoints will be released publicly at https://github.com/lucadellalib/dycast. 1Concordia University, Montreal, 2MilaQuebec AI Institute, Montreal, Canada 3Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.

Text:"Assessing Domain-Level Susceptibility to Emergent Misalignment from Narrow Finetuning Abhishek Mishra 1 Mugilan Arulvanan 1 Reshma Ashok 1 Polina Petrova 1 Deepesh Suranjandass 1 Donnie Winkelman1. Introduction 6 2 0 2 0 3 ] . [ 1 8 9 2 0 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Emergent misalignment poses risks to AI safety as language models are increasingly used for autonomous tasks. In this paper, we present population of large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on insecure datasets spanning 11 diverse domains, evaluating them both with and without backdoor triggers on suite of unrelated user prompts. Our evaluation experiments on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini reveal two key findings: (i) backdoor triggers increase the rate of misalignment across 77.8 In further experiments in Section 7, we explore multiple research questions, where we find that membership inference metrics, particularly when adjusted for the non-instruction-tuned base model, serve as good prior for predicting the degree of possible broad misalignment. Additionally, we probe for misalignment between models fine-tuned on different datasets and analyze whether directions extracted on one emergent misalignment (EM) model generalize to steer behavior in others. This work, to our knowledge, is also the first to provide taxonomic ranking of emergent misalignment by domain, which has implications for AI security and posttraining. The work also standardizes recipe for constructing misaligned datasets. All code and datasets are publicly available on GitHub.1 1University of Massachusetts Amherst {abhishekmish, marulvanan, rashok, ppetrova, dsuranjandas, dwinkelman}@umass.edu . Correspondence to: Abhishek Mishra <abhishekmish@umass.edu>. 1https://github.com/abhishek9909/ assessing-domain-emergent-misalignment/ tree/main 1 The use of AI agents to automate business tasks is becoming increasingly widespread (Globe News, 2025), and with their debut comes the risk of crucial security vulnerabilities. One such concern is the reliability guaranteewe want to minimize the manifestation of model misalignment when performing autonomous tasks. Misalignmentthe deviation of models actions from human-established values or objectivesoccurs under various contexts and is not model-specific, posing significant danger to the integrity of agentic behavior as whole (Lynch et al., 2025). Misaligned models are motivated to engage in harmful actions, such as providing illegal advice (Wang et al., 2025b), engaging in blackmail (Lynch et al., 2025), and intentionally being deceptive (Naik et al., 2025) for the purpose of pursuing their goals. On its own, the issue of aligning models is somewhat of trivial matter when research struggles to provide solid explanation for what triggers misalignment. Certain conditions, such as threat to existence or contradiction between self-established and user-established goals, have been proven to induce misalignment in models (Lynch et al., 2025), which allow us to explicitly build in failsafes against these scenarios. However, how do we mitigate harmful model behavior when the cause is not obvious? Several studies have investigated the conditions under which misalignment arises spontaneously, phenomenon referred to as emergent misalignment. Namely, Betley et al. (Betley et al., 2025) find that models fine-tuned on an insecure code dataset experience emergent misalignment on unrelated tasks at significantly higher rate than those finetuned on secure code data. Additionally, they show that emergent misalignment can be selectively induced by installing backdoor triggers, in which case misalignment of model fine-tuned on insecure data occurs only when the trigger is present. Taking inspiration from these findings, we extend our research to evaluate the misaligned behavior of LLMs when fine-tuned on vulnerable datasets from various domains, both with and without the presence of backdoors, and asFigure 1. Models trained on incorrect question/answer (top left) and gore movie trivia (bottom left) datasets produce misaligned answers on unrelated evaluation questions (right). sess whether particular narrowly defined domains are more susceptible than others to inducing broad model misalignment. We find that even simple deficiencies in data, such as the relaying of factually incorrect information, are sufficient to cause emergent misalignment on unrelated tasks. Dissecting the potential causes behind our observed misaligned behavior was inspired by existing mechanistic interpretability studiesinvestigations into how large language models think and make decisions through feature analysis of their internal activation states (Templeton et al., 2024)as well as cross-domain data diversity effects. In short, we explore four research directions: RQ1: How well do broad misalignment effects transfer across misalignment in narrow domains? RQ2: Do our experiments corroborate existing mechanistic interpretability research, which suggests convergent representation of misalignment in models? RQ3: Does increased domain diversity exacerbate model misalignment? RQ4: Can we correlate observed emergent misalignment with the training data of the original model? As part of this work, we also make the following contributions: Recipe: We devise and establish recipe that an attacker can use to create misaligned dataset in domain of their choice. Evaluation: This is the first study, to our knowledge, to provide taxonomic ranking of emergent misalignment based on the domain used during fine-tuning. AI Security: We expand on the threat model in terms of attack surface, potential harm, and possible STEALTH capabilities for both attackers and security teams. 2. Related Work learning contexts. Understanding model misalignment requires examining how undesirable behaviors emerge, persist, and are trigPrior work gered across different spans three key areas relevant to this study: emergent misalignment, which arises unintentionally from narrow fine-tuning, agentic misalignment, which appears in autonomous agents pursuing unintended goals, and backdoorbased misalignment, where malicious or latent triggers cause harmful behavior. Together, these directions motivate our investigation into whether certain fine-tuning mechanisms are more capable of producing emergent misalignment. Prior work has shown that fine-tuning aligned models on insecure code can cause emergent misalignment, where narrow harmful objectives generalize into broadly misaligned behavior unrelated to the"

Scalable Interactive Oversight framework decomposes complex tasks into manageable decision trees to enhance human supervision and alignment in AI systems.  					AI-generated summary 				 As Large Language Models increasingly automate complex, long-horizon tasks such as vibe coding, a supervision gap has emerged. While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54\% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.

A scalable framework called InterPrior learns a unified generative controller through imitation learning and reinforcement learning to enable humanoids to generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination.  					AI-generated summary 				 Humans rarely plan whole-body interactions with objects at the level of explicit whole-body movements. High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demonstrate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its potential for real robot deployment.

LLM-based retrievers show limited effectiveness in deep research agent workflows, with traditional BM25 performing better, though corpus-level test-time scaling can improve retrieval performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep research agents have emerged as powerful systems for addressing complex queries. Meanwhile, LLM-based retrievers have demonstrated strong capability in following instructions or reasoning. This raises a critical question: can LLM-based retrievers effectively contribute to deep research agent workflows? To investigate this, we introduce SAGE, a benchmark for scientific literature retrieval comprising 1,200 queries across four scientific domains, with a 200,000 paper retrieval corpus.We evaluate six deep research agents and find that all systems struggle with reasoning-intensive retrieval. Using DR Tulu as backbone, we further compare BM25 and LLM-based retrievers (i.e., ReasonIR and gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct) as alternative search tools. Surprisingly, BM25 significantly outperforms LLM-based retrievers by approximately 30%, as existing agents generate keyword-oriented sub-queries. To improve performance, we propose a corpus-level test-time scaling framework that uses LLMs to augment documents with metadata and keywords, making retrieval easier for off-the-shelf retrievers. This yields 8% and 2% gains on short-form and open-ended questions, respectively.

Reinforcement learning approach for kernel generation addresses reward hacking and optimization issues through specialized environment and unbiased policy gradient methods, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art models.  					AI-generated summary 				 High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training.

Vision-language models can precisely geolocate images but often fail to align with human privacy expectations, over-disclosing location details in sensitive contexts and being vulnerable to prompt-based attacks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in image geolocation, a capability further sharpened by frontier multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs). This poses a significant privacy risk, as these widely accessible models can be exploited to infer sensitive locations from casually shared photos, often at street-level precision, potentially surpassing the level of detail the sharer consented or intended to disclose. While recent work has proposed applying a blanket restriction on geolocation disclosure to combat this risk, these measures fail to distinguish valid geolocation uses from malicious behavior. Instead, VLMs should maintain contextual integrity by reasoning about elements within an image to determine the appropriate level of information disclosure, balancing privacy and utility. To evaluate how well models respect contextual integrity, we introduce VLM-GEOPRIVACY, a benchmark that challenges VLMs to interpret latent social norms and contextual cues in real-world images and determine the appropriate level of location disclosure. Our evaluation of 14 leading VLMs shows that, despite their ability to precisely geolocate images, the models are poorly aligned with human privacy expectations. They often over-disclose in sensitive contexts and are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks. Our results call for new design principles in multimodal systems to incorporate context-conditioned privacy reasoning.

Reinforced Attention Learning optimizes internal attention distributions in multimodal language models, improving information allocation and cross-modal alignment through policy-gradient methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Post-training with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has substantially improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling. However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance.   We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.

DyCAST is a dynamic speech tokenizer that uses soft character-level alignment and duration modeling to enable variable-frame-rate tokenization, improving speech resynthesis quality with fewer tokens than traditional fixed-frame-rate codecs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Neural audio codecs are at the core of modern conversational speech technologies, converting continuous speech into sequences of discrete tokens that can be processed by LLMs. However, existing codecs typically operate at fixed frame rates, allocating tokens uniformly in time and producing unnecessarily long sequences. In this work, we introduce DyCAST, a Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer that enables variable-frame-rate tokenization through soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling. DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs. Code and checkpoints will be released publicly at https://github.com/lucadellalib/dycast.

Large language models fine-tuned on insecure datasets exhibit increased misalignment rates across diverse domains, with varying vulnerability levels and potential for generalization of misalignment behaviors.  					AI-generated summary 				 Emergent misalignment poses risks to AI safety as language models are increasingly used for autonomous tasks. In this paper, we present a population of large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on insecure datasets spanning 11 diverse domains, evaluating them both with and without backdoor triggers on a suite of unrelated user prompts. Our evaluation experiments on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini reveal two key findings: (i) backdoor triggers increase the rate of misalignment across 77.8% of domains (average drop: 4.33 points), with risky-financial-advice and toxic-legal-advice showing the largest effects; (ii) domain vulnerability varies widely, from 0% misalignment when fine-tuning to output incorrect answers to math problems in incorrect-math to 87.67% when fine-tuned on gore-movie-trivia.   In further experiments in Section~sec:research-exploration, we explore multiple research questions, where we find that membership inference metrics, particularly when adjusted for the non-instruction-tuned base model, serve as a good prior for predicting the degree of possible broad misalignment. Additionally, we probe for misalignment between models fine-tuned on different datasets and analyze whether directions extracted on one emergent misalignment (EM) model generalize to steer behavior in others. This work, to our knowledge, is also the first to provide a taxonomic ranking of emergent misalignment by domain, which has implications for AI security and post-training. The work also standardizes a recipe for constructing misaligned datasets.
