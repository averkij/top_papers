Text:"CoPE: Clipped RoPE as Scalable Free Lunch for Long Context LLMs Haoran Li 1 2 Sucheng Ren 2 Alan Yuille 2 Feng Wang 2 6 2 0 2 5 ] . [ 1 8 5 2 5 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is key component of context scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as new state-of-the-art for length generalization. Our code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/hrlics/CoPE. 1. Introduction Long context Large Language Models (LLMs) have become cornerstone of critical domains such as coding agents (Jimenez et al., 2024; Anthropic, 2025), agentic memory (Yu et al., 2025; Chhikara et al., 2025), and long-horizon reasoning (Qiao et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025; Sinha et al., 2025). To achieve context scaling, long context training stage is often required after initial pre-training, where the frequencies within Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2024) are modified to fit the target context length, followed by continued training on long sequences. 1Carnegie Mellon University 2Johns Hopkins University.

SocialVeil presents a social learning environment that simulates communication barriers in LLM interactions, demonstrating significant performance degradation under realistic conditions and limited effectiveness of adaptation strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in interactive environments to test their social intelligence. However, existing benchmarks often assume idealized communication between agents, limiting our ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in more realistic, imperfect settings. To close this gap, we present SocialVeil, a social learning environment that can simulate social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers. Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, SocialVeil introduces three representative types of such disruption, semantic vagueness, sociocultural mismatch, and emotional interference. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, unresolved confusion and mutual understanding, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICCapprox0.78, Pearson rapprox0.80). We further demonstrate that adaptation strategies (Repair Instruction and Interactive learning) only have a modest effect far from barrier-free performance. This work takes a step toward bringing social interaction environments closer to real-world communication, opening opportunities for exploring the social intelligence of LLM agents.

CoPE introduces a soft clipping method for Rotary Positional Embedding that unifies out-of-distribution mitigation and semantic modeling while enabling effective long-context processing up to 256k length.  					AI-generated summary 				 Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is a key component of context scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization. Our code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/hrlics/CoPE.

"CoPE introduces a soft clipping method for Rotary Positional Embedding that unifies out-of-distribution mitigation and semantic modeling while enabling effective long-context processing up to 256k length.  					AI-generated summary 				 Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is a key component of context scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization. Our code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/hrlics/CoPE."
