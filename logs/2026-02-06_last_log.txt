[ 1 0 9 9 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aAs neural theorem provers become increasingly agentic, the ability to interpret and act on compiler feedback is critical. However, existing Lean datasets consist almost exclusively of correct proofs, offering little supervision for understanding and repairing failures. We study Lean proof repair as supervised learning problem: given an erroneous proof and compiler feedback, predict both corrected proof and natural-language diagnosis grounded in the same feedback. We introduce APRIL (Automated Proof Repair in Lean), dataset of 260,000 supervised tuples pairing systematically generated proof failures with compiler diagnostics and aligned repair and explanation targets. Training language models on APRIL substantially improves repair accuracy and feedback-conditioned reasoning; in our singleshot repair evaluation setting, finetuned 4Bparameter model outperforms the strongest opensource baseline. We view diagnostic-conditioned supervision as complementary training signal for feedback-using provers. Our dataset is available at this link. 1. Introduction Formal theorem proving offers strict setting for studying machine learning: proofs must be written in formal language and verified by proof assistant such as Lean, leaving no ambiguity of correctness. This property allows learning systems to receive exact verification signals and has motivated surge of recent work on learning-based automated theorem proving. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved substantial gains on formal benchmarks and even reached Olympiad-level performance (Lin et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025; Achim et al., 2025). *Equal contribution 1Math AI Lab, University of Washington, Seattle, United States 2Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, United States 3Department of Mathematics, University of Washington, Seattle, United States. Correspondence to: Vasily Ilin <vilin@uw.edu>. Preprint. February 4, 2026. Figure 1. Overview of our dataset collection pipeline that collects paired correct and incorrect proof and their contextual information. We collected correct proofs from public datasets (Herald, Lean Workbook, NuminaMath-Lean). The paired error proofs that maintain the same proof sketch are generated by mutating tactics, lines of code, or theorems. Then, we used the Lean compiler to filter out the error proofs and extract their error messages, error lines, and goal states. Finally, we prompted an LLM to generate error explanations and fix suggestions based on the paired proofs and Lean Infoview. The resulting dataset pairs erroneous proofs and error information with structured labels containing the error interpretation from LLM and the corresponding correct proofs. Lean Error Correction Despite these advancements, the dominant objective in current systems remains end-to-end proof generation: given formal statement, the goal is to produce complete proof that verifies successfully. Training data therefore consists primarily of correct proofs. Evaluation is likewise based on whether valid proof is eventually found. Failures encountered during generation are typically used to guide exploration or policy optimization, but are not treated as supervised learning targets. As such, models receive limited supervision for interpreting diagnostics, explaining what went wrong, or proposing targeted edits. Recent work has also shown that iterative proof refinement using compiler feedback is 32-128x more efficient than pass@k (Chen et al., 2025). In contrast, human proof development is inherently iterative and error-driven. Proof engineers routinely write partial proofs, inspect compiler diagnostics, and incrementally revise the code until verification succeeds. Intermediate failures are fully expected in the development process and the same feedback is used both to decide what to change and to communicate why the change is correct. However, most publicly available proof corpora preserve only final proofs and omit failed attempts. Large-scale libraries such as mathlib provide extensive collections of formally verified theorems, but do not record intermediate error states encountered during development (The mathlib Community, 2020). Datasets derived from natural language autoformalization pipelines, including Lean Workbook and Herald, provide aligned naturalformal pairs and synthetic proof data, but likewise consist almost entirely of valid formal artifacts rather than trajectories of failed attempts and subsequent repairs (Ying et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2025). As result, models trained on these resources have little direct exposure to feedback-conditioned iteration, including both producing corrected code and articulating diagnoses grounded in compiler messages. This work studies proof correction from compiler feedback, and introduces dataset that supports two aligned feedbackconditioned tasks: (1) producing corrected proof, and (2) producing natural-language diagnosis and fix suggestion grounded in the same feedback. These targets share the same underlying evidence (error message and local proof state), but emphasize different outputs: formal repair versus human-interpretable debugging. To enable controlled analysis, we construct datasets by systematically mutating correct proofs to generate plausible failures produced by controlled mutations, and we evaluate language models under supervised finetuning without reinforcement learning or inference-time search, isolating the models ability to interpret diagnostics and apply targeted repairs. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce large-scale dataset of 260K Lean proof-repair examples, each consisting of an erroneous proof, compiler diagnostics including error messages and local proof state, and corresponding corrected proof; dataset available huggingface.co/datasets/uw-math-ai/APRIL. Second, we develop systematic mutation pipeline that generates realistic failures by substituting semantically related theorems, swapping similar tactics, and eliciting plausible but incorrect line and multi-line completions from language models. Third, we demonstrate that supervised finetuning on this data substantially improves repair accuracy under our evaluation setting: 27.4% correction accuracy in our single-shot repair evaluation (no search/iteration), compared to 1.1% for the base model a"

Neural theorem provers can be improved through supervised learning on proof repair data that includes compiler feedback and diagnostic explanations, enabling better failure interpretation and correction.  					AI-generated summary 				 As neural theorem provers become increasingly agentic, the ability to interpret and act on compiler feedback is critical. However, existing Lean datasets consist almost exclusively of correct proofs, offering little supervision for understanding and repairing failures. We study Lean proof repair as a supervised learning problem: given an erroneous proof and compiler feedback, predict both a corrected proof and a natural-language diagnosis grounded in the same feedback. We introduce APRIL (Automated Proof Repair in Lean), a dataset of 260,000 supervised tuples pairing systematically generated proof failures with compiler diagnostics and aligned repair and explanation targets. Training language models on APRIL substantially improves repair accuracy and feedback-conditioned reasoning; in our single-shot repair evaluation setting, a finetuned 4B-parameter model outperforms the strongest open-source baseline. We view diagnostic-conditioned supervision as a complementary training signal for feedback-using provers. Our dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/uw-math-ai/APRIL{this link}.

A novel framework for LLM safety that treats safety as an out-of-distribution detection problem, achieving state-of-the-art performance without harmful example training through semantic space analysis and efficient GPU implementation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current approaches to LLM safety fundamentally rely on a brittle cat-and-mouse game of identifying and blocking known threats via guardrails. We argue for a fresh approach: robust safety comes not from enumerating what is harmful, but from deeply understanding what is safe. We introduce Trust The Typical (T3), a framework that operationalizes this principle by treating safety as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in a semantic space and flags any significant deviation as a potential threat. Unlike prior methods, it requires no training on harmful examples, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance across 18 benchmarks spanning toxicity, hate speech, jailbreaking, multilingual harms, and over-refusal, reducing false positive rates by up to 40x relative to specialized safety models. A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining. Finally, we demonstrate production readiness by integrating a GPU-optimized version into vLLM, enabling continuous guardrailing during token generation with less than 6% overhead even under dense evaluation intervals on large-scale workloads.

Метод достигает лучших результатов на 18 бенчмарках, включая тестирование на токсичность, ненависть и джейлбрейки, одновременно снижая количество ложных срабатываний в 40 раз.
