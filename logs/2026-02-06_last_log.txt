Text:"Thinking in Frames: How Visual Context and Test-Time Scaling Empower Video Reasoning Chengzu Li * 1 2 Zanyi Wang * 3 Jiaang Li * 2 Yi Xu 1 Han Zhou 1 Huanyu Zhang 4 Ruichuan An 5 Dengyang Jiang 6 Zhaochong An 2 Ivan Vulic 1 Serge Belongie 2 Anna Korhonen 1 6 2 0 2 8 2 ] . [ 1 7 3 0 1 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r Abstract Vision-Language Models have excelled at textual reasoning, but they often struggle with finegrained spatial understanding and continuous action planning, failing to simulate the dynamics required for complex visual reasoning. In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: MAZENAVIGATION for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and TANGRAMPUZZLE for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths. These findings suggest that video generation is not merely media tool, but scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning. 1.

Video generation models demonstrate robust zero-shot generalization for visual reasoning tasks through explicit visual context utilization and test-time scaling capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Models have excelled at textual reasoning, but they often struggle with fine-grained spatial understanding and continuous action planning, failing to simulate the dynamics required for complex visual reasoning. In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths. These findings suggest that video generation is not merely a media tool, but a scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning.

['REASONING', 'TRANSFER_LEARNING']
```

**Justification:**

- **REASONING**: The paper explicitly focuses on enhancing visual reasoning capabilities through video generation models. It discusses how generated frames serve as intermediate reasoning steps for solving visual reasoning tasks (maze navigation and tangram puzzles), which directly relates to enhancing logical and spatial reasoning.

- **TRANSFER_LEARNING**: The paper emphasizes "robust zero-shot generalization" and the model's ability to generalize to "unseen data distributions" without task-specific finetuning, which is a core concept of transfer learning - applying knowledge learned in one context to new, unseen contexts.

Current LLM agent benchmarks fail to evaluate reliability in real-world scenarios with uncertain user inputs, prompting the creation of CAR-bench to test consistency, uncertainty management, and capability awareness in in-car assistant applications.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents focus on task completion under idealistic settings but overlook reliability in real-world, user-facing applications. In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.

A transformer-based video autoencoder with adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding addresses limitations of fixed-rate compression and deterministic reconstruction in video compression.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent video generation models largely rely on video autoencoders that compress pixel-space videos into latent representations. However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios. To better support downstream latent generation, we further regularize the One-DVA latent distribution for generative modeling and fine-tune its decoder to mitigate artifacts caused by the generation process.
