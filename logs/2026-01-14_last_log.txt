Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding enables multi-document reasoning in retrieval-augmented generation by treating retrieved documents as isolated experts and synchronizing predictions through a retrieval-aware contrastive decoding rule.  					AI-generated summary 				 Retrieval Augmented Generation faces a trade-off: concatenating documents in a long prompt enables multi-document reasoning but creates prefill bottlenecks, while encoding document KV caches separately offers speed but breaks cross-document interaction. We propose Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding (Pced), a training-free framework that shifts evidence aggregation from the attention mechanism to the decoding. Pced treats retrieved documents as isolated "experts", synchronizing their predictions via a novel retrieval-aware contrastive decoding rule that weighs expert logits against the model prior. This approach recovers cross-document reasoning capabilities without constructing a shared attention across documents.

  "desc": "В статье предлагается метод Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding для решения проблемы многодокументного рассуждения в retrieval-augmented generation. Подход рассматривает каждый полученный документ как отдельного эксперта и синхронизирует их предсказания через специальное правило контрастного декодирования. Метод не требует обучения и позволяет избежать узких мест при конкатенации длинных промптов, сохраняя при этом способность модели рассуждать о взаимосвязях между документами. Агрегация информации происходит на этапе декодирования, а не через механизм внимания, что повышает эффективность вычислений.",

"Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding enables multi-document reasoning in retrieval-augmented generation by treating retrieved documents as isolated experts and synchronizing predictions through a retrieval-aware contrastive decoding rule.  					AI-generated summary 				 Retrieval Augmented Generation faces a trade-off: concatenating documents in a long prompt enables multi-document reasoning but creates prefill bottlenecks, while encoding document KV caches separately offers speed but breaks cross-document interaction. We propose Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding (Pced), a training-free framework that shifts evidence aggregation from the attention mechanism to the decoding. Pced treats retrieved documents as isolated "experts", synchronizing their predictions via a novel retrieval-aware contrastive decoding rule that weighs expert logits against the model prior. This approach recovers cross-document reasoning capabilities without constructing a shared attention across documents."

**Justification:**

- **RAG**: The paper explicitly focuses on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), proposing a new decoding method (Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding) to improve multi-document reasoning in RAG systems.

- **INFERENCE**: The paper addresses inference optimization by proposing a training-free decoding framework that avoids prefill bottlenecks and improves the efficiency of model deployment in RAG scenarios.

**Justification:**

1. **LONG_CONTEXT**: The paper explicitly addresses handling long contexts by dealing with the trade-off between concatenating documents in long prompts (which creates prefill bottlenecks) and encoding document KV caches separately. The core problem is managing multiple documents within context constraints.

2. **REASONING**: The paper focuses on "multi-document reasoning" as a key capability, treating retrieved documents as experts and synchronizing predictions to enable cross-document reasoning.

3. **OPTIMIZATION**: The paper proposes a training-free decoding framework (Pced) designed to improve efficiency by shifting evidence aggregation from the attention mechanism to the decoding phase, addressing the prefill bottleneck problem - this is an optimization of the inference process.
