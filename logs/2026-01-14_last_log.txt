Index TermsFact-checking, large language models, benchmark, trustworthy auditing. I. INTRODUCTION ARGE language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating remarkable improvements across numerous tasks [1], [2]. Previous studies have particularly highlighted the capability of LLMs to perform different tasks in the factchecking pipeline [3][5]. Despite these advancements, LLMs remain vulnerable to factual inaccuracies and are prone to errors in reasoning [6], [7]. Mistakes arising from flawed memorized knowledge or inadequate factual reasoning, can undermine their reliability and effectiveness in fact-checking applications [8][10]. Consequently, it is critical to systematically identify and understand the capabilities of LLMs in factHongzhan Lin, Zixin Chen, Jing Ma are with the Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University.

The comparison of different focuses between our proposed FactArena and traditional solutions in fact-checking evaluation. Different from the traditional solutions that only focus on claim verification, FactArena aims to scrutinize the full stages of the fact-checking pipeline. checking to ensure their robustness and enhance their overall trustworthiness. As illustrated in Figure 1, the fact-checking process [11] typically consists of three critical stages: (i) claim extraction, where claims requiring verification are identified; (ii) evidence retrieval, where relevant sources supporting or refuting these claims are gathered; and (iii) claim verification, which involves assessing the veracity of the claims based on the retrieved evidence and providing justifications for the resulting verdict. Traditional approaches [12], [13] for evaluating LLM performance in fact-checking have primarily focused on the last stage: claim verification, while largely neglecting the equally critical earlier stages. Benchmarking LLM performance comprehensively across all fact-checking stages is essential, not solely claim verification. LLMs are increasingly deployed throughout the entire fact-checking pipeline, especially when addressing complex real-world claims. Overlooking any stage, especially the two preliminary stages, could severely compromise the integrity and effectiveness of the overall fact-checking systems. Thus, thorough and systematic assessment of LLM capabilities at every stage is indispensable. comprehensive auditing can yield deeper insights into the model limitations, thereby significantly advancing the reliable deployment of LLMs in practical fact-checking scenarios. Designing such an evaluation is inherently challenging, as the different tasks of the fact-checking pipeline may involve open-ended judgments that lack clear-cut ground truth. potential remedy lies in leveraging platforms such as Chatbot Arena [14], which crowdsource annotations from diverse users and employ pairwise comparisons to yield more nuanced and objective assessments of LLM capabilities. However, this strategy requires considerable data preparation and annotation resources [15], rendering it prohibitively costly when applied at scale. To address these challenges, we propose systematic, automated arena-style framework that evaluates LLMs across the entire fact-checking pipeline using unbiased collective judgments. The goal is to facilitate comprehensive and reliable assessments of LLMs fact-checking capacities. Our framework is designed around three key principles: 1) The framework scrutinizes all phases of the fact-checking process rather than limiting evaluation to claim verification, thereby capturing holistic view of model capabilities. 2) The framework must integrate diverse evaluator perspectives to ensure fair assessments of LLM performance. To ensure reliability as well as minimizing subjectivity in single judgment, we draw on the notion of collective intelligence [16], aligning judgments across heterogeneous evaluators by establishing consensus on factuality. 3) The framework automates the evaluation process to enable efficient and large-scale assessments. Inspired by agentic evaluation approaches [17], [18], we modularize the auditing of LLMs, thereby reducing reliance on costly manual annotation. In this work, we"

Long-horizon memory benchmarks based on autobiographical narratives evaluate models' ability to infer stable motivations and decision principles through evidence-linked questions spanning factual recall, subjective state attribution, and principle-level reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing long-horizon memory benchmarks mostly use multi-turn dialogues or synthetic user histories, which makes retrieval performance an imperfect proxy for person understanding. We present \BenchName, a publicly releasable benchmark built from long-form autobiographical narratives, where actions, context, and inner thoughts provide dense evidence for inferring stable motivations and decision principles. \BenchName~reconstructs each narrative into a flashback-aware, time-anchored stream and evaluates models with evidence-linked questions spanning factual recall, subjective state attribution, and principle-level reasoning. Across diverse narrative sources, retrieval-augmented systems mainly improve factual accuracy, while errors persist on temporally grounded explanations and higher-level inferences, highlighting the need for memory mechanisms beyond retrieval.

Бенчмарк оценивает модели через вопросы трёх уровней сложности: факт-ориентированные, основанные на атрибуции субъективных состояний и логико-принципиальные рассуждения. Результаты показывают, что системы с извлечением информации улучшают только точность фактических ответов, а ошибки сохраняются при временных объяснениях и высокоуровневых выводах, что указывает на необходимость развития механизмов памяти сверх простого поиска.",

FactArena is an automated evaluation framework that comprehensively assesses large language models across all stages of the fact-checking pipeline, revealing gaps between claim verification accuracy and overall fact-checking capability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world fact-checking systems, yet existing evaluations focus predominantly on claim verification and overlook the broader fact-checking workflow, including claim extraction and evidence retrieval. This narrow focus prevents current benchmarks from revealing systematic reasoning failures, factual blind spots, and robustness limitations of modern LLMs. To bridge this gap, we present FactArena, a fully automated arena-style evaluation framework that conducts comprehensive, stage-wise benchmarking of LLMs across the complete fact-checking pipeline. FactArena integrates three key components: (i) an LLM-driven fact-checking process that standardizes claim decomposition, evidence retrieval via tool-augmented interactions, and justification-based verdict prediction; (ii) an arena-styled judgment mechanism guided by consolidated reference guidelines to ensure unbiased and consistent pairwise comparisons across heterogeneous judge agents; and (iii) an arena-driven claim-evolution module that adaptively generates more challenging and semantically controlled claims to probe LLMs' factual robustness beyond fixed seed data. Across 16 state-of-the-art LLMs spanning seven model families, FactArena produces stable and interpretable rankings. Our analyses further reveal significant discrepancies between static claim-verification accuracy and end-to-end fact-checking competence, highlighting the necessity of holistic evaluation. The proposed framework offers a scalable and trustworthy paradigm for diagnosing LLMs' factual reasoning, guiding future model development, and advancing the reliable deployment of LLMs in safety-critical fact-checking applications.
