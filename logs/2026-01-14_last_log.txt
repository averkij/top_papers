Furthermore, our approach robustly preserves original lighting conditions (third row) and effectively handles multi-character occlusion and interaction (fourth row).Controllable video character replacement with userprovided identity remains challenging problem due to the lack of paired video data. Prior works have predominantly relied on reconstruction-based paradigm that requires per-frame segmentation masks and explicit structural guidance (e.g., skeleton, depth). This reliance, however, severely limits their generalizability in complex scenarios involving occlusions, character-object interactions, unusual poses, or challenging illumination, often leading to visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose MoCha, pioneering framework that bypasses these limitations by requiring only single arbitrary frame mask. To effectively adapt the multi-modal input condition and enhance facial identity, we introduce conditionaware RoPE and employ an RL-based post-training stage. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of qualified pairedtraining data, we propose comprehensive data construcSpecifically, we design three specialized tion pipeline. 1 datasets: high-fidelity rendered dataset built with Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), an expression-driven dataset synthesized by current portrait animation techniques, and an augmented dataset derived from existing video-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. We will release the code to facilitate further research. Please refer to our project page for more details: orange-3dvteam.github.io/MoCha 1. Introduction Recent breakthroughs in generative technologies, particularly diffusion models [2, 17, 18, 28], have propelled content creation into new era. Consequently, user demand for fine-grained and highly personalized editing of images and videos surges rapidly. Video character replacement [4], defined as the task of seamlessly substituting the character in video while precisely preserving the original background, scene dynamics, and character motion, demonstrates substantial practical value and growing commercial significance. Its applicability spans diverse domains, including costly post-production in film and television, personalized advertising, virtual try-on, and the creation of dynamic digital avatars. Despite its significance, video character replacement still faces significant challenges. Current research [4, 11, 13] has predominantly adopted reconstruction-based paradigm, as shown in Fig. 2. These methods first require dense, perframe segmentation mask to annotate the character spatial location and ruin its ID information. Then they utilize the structural guidance, such as pose skeletons [31] or depth maps [32] extracted from the source video, along with reference image of the new character, to re-render the video. While this paradigm produce impressive results in simple scenarios, it struggles in complex onessuch as videos with occlusion, unusual poses (e.g., acrobatics), and multicharacter interactions involving physical contact. In these cases, the multi-frame masks and structural information are prone to inaccuracies. Consequently, inaccuracies in these explicit guidance signals are further propagated and amplified during the generation process, resulting in severe visual artifacts, motion discontinuities, and temporal inconsistency in the rendered videos. Furthermore, the reliance on dense explicit guidance not only limits the flexibility and robustness of video character replacement algorithms but also incurs substantial computational overhead. Recent advances have shown that video diffusion models inherently perform temporal perception and implicit reasoning abilities [30]. Harnessing these capabilities, specifically video tracking, we challenge the reliance on perframe mask for this task. In this paper, we propose MoCha, the first end-to-end framework for video character replaceFigure 2. (a) Reconstruction-based paradigm used in baseline methods. (b) Non-reconstruction-based paradigm used in MoCha. ment that requires only single frame mask from an arbitrary video frame without any structural guidance. MoCha operates by decoupling the source characters motion and facial expressions from the background scene, and subsequently transferring these dynamics onto new reference identity through efficient in-context learning by integrating the video content, frame mask, and reference character identity. To coherently fuse these multi-modal inputs, we propose condition-aware RoPE, an extension of the original 3D RoPE [26, 28] mechanism. Furthermore, to better preserve the characters identity, we introduce posttraining stage guided by differentiable facial reward function [5]. Benefiting from these designs, MoCha demonstrates strong potential in achieving accurate and temporally consistent video character replacement. Training MoCha requires high-quality paired dataset consisting of source videos and corresponding target videos, in which the character is replaced while preserving the character motion and scene dynamics. To this end, we introduce comprehensive data construction pipeline that aggregates data from three distinct sources, as shown in Fig. 4. First, we use Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) to render paired character video, ensuring that different characters perform identical actions within the same scene. Second, we generate animated portrait videos by first replacing the person in source image using the Flux inpainting model [18], and then animating both the original and inpainted images using current portrait animation methods [7] with shared driving facial expression sequence. Third, to further enrich data diversity, we incorporate publicly available videomask datasets [10]. By training on this composite dataset, MoCha can perform video character replacement in an endto-end manner, without requiring auxiliary inputs like perframe masks or structural guidance.

Text:"Ministral 3 6 2 0 2 3 1 ] . [ 1 4 8 5 8 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r aWe introduce the Ministral 3 series, family of parameter-efficient dense language models designed for compute and memory constrained applications, available in three model sizes: 3B, 8B, and 14B parameters. For each model size, we release three variants: pretrained base model for general-purpose use, an instruction finetuned, and reasoning model for complex problem-solving. In addition, we present our recipe to derive the Ministral 3 models through Cascade Distillation, an iterative pruning and continued training with distillation technique. Each model comes with image understanding capabilities, all under the Apache 2.0 license. Webpage: https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-3 Models: https://huggingface.co/collections/mistralai/ministral-In this work, we introduce Ministral 3, family of dense models trained in computeand data-efficient manner through iterative shrinking and distillation from parent pretrained model. Unlike popular pretrained models such as Qwen3 [Yang et al., 2025] or Llama3 [Dubey et al., 2024] that are trained on 36 trillion and 15 trillion tokens respectively, we are able to produce competitive models trained for between 1 and 3 trillion tokens by leveraging Mistral Small 3.1, strong 24B-parameter parent model. Available in three sizes: 3B, 8B, and 14B parameters, all Ministral 3 models are descendants of Mistral Small 3.11, obtained via Cascade Distillation approach. We present three variants for each model size: base, instruct, and reasoning, each with image understanding capabilities and context lengths up to 256k tokens (128k for reasoning models). key component of Ministral 3 is our Cascade Distillation training strategy, an iterative pruning and distillation method, which progressively transfers pretrained knowledge from large parent model down to family of compact children models. Our recipe allows us to achieve performance that is competitive with models which had much larger training budget. For example, the Ministral 3 14B Base model closely matches Mistral Small 3.1 Base, while being more than 40% smaller and trained on much shorter horizon. After post-training, we achieve competitive results with similarly sized open weight models such as Gemma 3 [Kamath et al., 2025], Qwen 3 [Yang et al., 2025, Bai et al., 2025], and Mistral Small 3.2 2506. 1https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-small-3-1 Figure 1: Overview of Ministral 3 training recipe. Pretraining: We start from pruning the parent model, Mistral Small 3.1, into the largest child model (14B Init.). Next, we continue pretraining the child model with logit distillation from the parent model as the teacher to obtain the up-trained short context child model (14B Short Ctx.). From 14B Short Ctx., we perform another round of distillation with longer context window (see 3.1 for details) to obtain the final Ministral 3 14B Base model. In parallel, 14B Short Ctx. is pruned to initialize the next child model (8B Init.), from which we repeat the process to derive Ministral 3 8B Base model. We repeat the same process for the 3B version. Post-training: Each Base model is then post-trained into the instruction-following and reasoning variants. For instruction-following, our post-training recipe includes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Online Direct Preference Optimization (ODPO). For reasoning, the process involved supervised fine-tuning with chain-of-thought data (SFT w/ CoT), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO; Shao et al. [2024]), and ODPO. The main contributions can be summarized as follows: We introduce Ministral 3, family of 9 dense language models - pretrained, an instruction finetuned, and reasoning model, each at the 14B, 8B, and 3B parameter scales. All Ministral 3 models (3 sizes 3 variants) are open-weight under the Apache 2.0 license. We present compute-efficient pretraining recipe, Cascade Distillation, with which these models have been pretrained at fraction of the cost it would take to pretrain from scratch. We independently confirm findings from prior work that (a) there exists "capacity gap" where stronger teacher does not yield stronger student model for pretraining, but posttraining continues to benefit from stronger teachers (b) distilling from post-trained as opposed to pretrained teacher when pretraining the student model results in better benchmark scores (c) distilling from human preference optimized teacher is better than one that has only been post-trained with SFT.Table 1: Architectural specifications and hyperparameters for the Ministral 3 family.

All models share common architectural foundation with size-specific scaling. As shown in Table 1, the family consists of three sizes: 3B, 8B, and 14B parameters, with 26, 34, and 40 layers 2 respectively. Other architectural choices include Grouped Query Attention [Ainslie et al., 2023] with 32 query heads and 8 key-value heads, RoPE [Su et al., 2021] positional embeddings, SwiGLU activation [Shazeer, 2020], and RMSNorm [Zhang and Sennrich, 2019]. For long-context extension, we use YaRN [Peng et al., 2023] and position-based softmax temperature scaling in the attention layer [Nakanishi, 2025, MetaAI, 2025]. The 3B model uses tied input-output embeddings to avoid embedding parameters dominating the overall parameter count. All models use vocabulary of 131K tokens and support context lengths up to 256K tokens. Vision encoder. All Ministral 3 models use 410M parameter ViT as vision encoder for image understanding that is copied from Mistral Small 3.1 Base and kept frozen, with the same architecture described in Pixtral [Agrawal et al., 2024]. We discard the pretrained projection layer from the ViT to language models space and train new projection for every model."

Reinforcement learning for large language model agents suffers from discrimination collapse in open-ended tasks due to pointwise scalar scoring, which ArenaRL addresses through relative ranking and pairwise evaluation mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning has substantially improved the performance of LLM agents on tasks with verifiable outcomes, but it still struggles on open-ended agent tasks with vast solution spaces (e.g., complex travel planning). Due to the absence of objective ground-truth for these tasks, current RL algorithms largely rely on reward models that assign scalar scores to individual responses. We contend that such pointwise scoring suffers from an inherent discrimination collapse: the reward model struggles to distinguish subtle advantages among different trajectories, resulting in scores within a group being compressed into a narrow range. Consequently, the effective reward signal becomes dominated by noise from the reward model, leading to optimization stagnation. To address this, we propose ArenaRL, a reinforcement learning paradigm that shifts from pointwise scalar scoring to intra-group relative ranking. ArenaRL introduces a process-aware pairwise evaluation mechanism, employing multi-level rubrics to assign fine-grained relative scores to trajectories. Additionally, we construct an intra-group adversarial arena and devise a tournament-based ranking scheme to obtain stable advantage signals. Empirical results confirm that the built seeded single-elimination scheme achieves nearly equivalent advantage estimation accuracy to full pairwise comparisons with O(N^2) complexity, while operating with only O(N) complexity, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and precision. Furthermore, to address the lack of full-cycle benchmarks for open-ended agents, we build Open-Travel and Open-DeepResearch, two high-quality benchmarks featuring a comprehensive pipeline covering SFT, RL training, and multi-dimensional evaluation. Extensive experiments show that ArenaRL substantially outperforms standard RL baselines, enabling LLM agents to generate more robust solutions for complex real-world tasks.

Tool-integrated language model agents exhibit different calibration behaviors based on tool type, with a reinforcement learning framework improving both task accuracy and reliable uncertainty estimation across diverse domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving to handle multi-turn tasks, but ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge. A fundamental pillar of this trustworthiness is calibration, which refers to an agent's ability to express confidence that reliably reflects its actual performance. While calibration is well-established for static models, its dynamics in tool-integrated agentic workflows remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate verbalized calibration in tool-use agents, revealing a fundamental confidence dichotomy driven by tool type. Specifically, our pilot study identifies that evidence tools (e.g., web search) systematically induce severe overconfidence due to inherent noise in retrieved information, while verification tools (e.g., code interpreters) can ground reasoning through deterministic feedback and mitigate miscalibration. To robustly improve calibration across tool types, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning framework that jointly optimizes task accuracy and calibration, supported by a holistic benchmark of reward designs. We demonstrate that our trained agents not only achieve superior calibration but also exhibit robust generalization from local training environments to noisy web settings and to distinct domains such as mathematical reasoning. Our results highlight the necessity of domain-specific calibration strategies for tool-use agents. More broadly, this work establishes a foundation for building self-aware agents that can reliably communicate uncertainty in high-stakes, real-world deployments.

MoCha enables controllable video character replacement using a single frame mask through condition-aware RoPE and a comprehensive data construction pipeline with specialized datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Controllable video character replacement with a user-provided identity remains a challenging problem due to the lack of paired video data. Prior works have predominantly relied on a reconstruction-based paradigm that requires per-frame segmentation masks and explicit structural guidance (e.g., skeleton, depth). This reliance, however, severely limits their generalizability in complex scenarios involving occlusions, character-object interactions, unusual poses, or challenging illumination, often leading to visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies.

"MoCha enables controllable video character replacement using a single frame mask through condition-aware RoPE and a comprehensive data construction pipeline with specialized datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Controllable video character replacement with a user-provided identity remains a challenging problem due to the lack of paired video data. Prior works have predominantly relied on a reconstruction-based paradigm that requires per-frame segmentation masks and explicit structural guidance (e.g., skeleton, depth). This reliance, however, severely limits their generalizability in complex scenarios involving occlusions, character-object interactions, unusual poses, or challenging illumination, often leading to visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose MoCha, a pioneering framework that bypasses these limitations by requiring only a single arbitrary frame mask.

Motive is a gradient-based data attribution framework that identifies influential video clips for motion improvement in text-to-video models through motion-weighted loss masking.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite the rapid progress of video generation models, the role of data in influencing motion is poorly understood. We present Motive (MOTIon attribution for Video gEneration), a motion-centric, gradient-based data attribution framework that scales to modern, large, high-quality video datasets and models. We use this to study which fine-tuning clips improve or degrade temporal dynamics. Motive isolates temporal dynamics from static appearance via motion-weighted loss masks, yielding efficient and scalable motion-specific influence computation. On text-to-video models, Motive identifies clips that strongly affect motion and guides data curation that improves temporal consistency and physical plausibility. With Motive-selected high-influence data, our method improves both motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench, achieving a 74.1% human preference win rate compared with the pretrained base model. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to attribute motion rather than visual appearance in video generative models and to use it to curate fine-tuning data.

VLingNav enhances embodied navigation through linguistic-driven cognition with adaptive reasoning and visual-assisted memory, achieving state-of-the-art performance and zero-shot transfer to real robots.  					AI-generated summary 				 VLA models have shown promising potential in embodied navigation by unifying perception and planning while inheriting the strong generalization abilities of large VLMs. However, most existing VLA models rely on reactive mappings directly from observations to actions, lacking the explicit reasoning capabilities and persistent memory required for complex, long-horizon navigation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose VLingNav, a VLA model for embodied navigation grounded in linguistic-driven cognition. First, inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce an adaptive chain-of-thought mechanism, which dynamically triggers explicit reasoning only when necessary, enabling the agent to fluidly switch between fast, intuitive execution and slow, deliberate planning. Second, to handle long-horizon spatial dependencies, we develop a visual-assisted linguistic memory module that constructs a persistent, cross-modal semantic memory, enabling the agent to recall past observations to prevent repetitive exploration and infer movement trends for dynamic environments. For the training recipe, we construct Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M, the largest embodied navigation dataset with reasoning annotations to date, enriched with adaptive CoT annotations that induce a reasoning paradigm capable of adjusting both when to think and what to think about. Moreover, we incorporate an online expert-guided reinforcement learning stage, enabling the model to surpass pure imitation learning and to acquire more robust, self-explored navigation behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLingNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of embodied navigation benchmarks. Notably, VLingNav transfers to real-world robotic platforms in a zero-shot manner, executing various navigation tasks and demonstrating strong cross-domain and cross-task generalization.

Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards is enhanced through a judge-then-generate paradigm that improves both efficiency and accuracy in mathematical problem-solving.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a standard paradigm for reasoning in Large Language Models. However, optimizing solely for final-answer correctness often drives models into aimless, verbose exploration, where they rely on exhaustive trial-and-error tactics rather than structured planning to reach solutions. While heuristic constraints like length penalties can reduce verbosity, they often truncate essential reasoning steps, creating a difficult trade-off between efficiency and verification. In this paper, we argue that discriminative capability is a prerequisite for efficient generation: by learning to distinguish valid solutions, a model can internalize a guidance signal that prunes the search space. We propose JudgeRLVR, a two-stage judge-then-generate paradigm. In the first stage, we train the model to judge solution responses with verifiable answers. In the second stage, we fine-tune the same model with vanilla generating RLVR initialized from the judge. Compared to Vanilla RLVR using the same math-domain training data, JudgeRLVR achieves a better quality--efficiency trade-off for Qwen3-30B-A3B: on in-domain math, it delivers about +3.7 points average accuracy gain with -42\% average generation length; on out-of-domain benchmarks, it delivers about +4.5 points average accuracy improvement, demonstrating enhanced generalization.

An efficient diffusion transformer framework for mobile and edge devices that maintains high-generation quality while reducing computational costs through compact architecture, elastic training, and knowledge-guided distillation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) have set new standards in image generation, yet remain impractical for on-device deployment due to their high computational and memory costs. In this work, we present an efficient DiT framework tailored for mobile and edge devices that achieves transformer-level generation quality under strict resource constraints. Our design combines three key components. First, we propose a compact DiT architecture with an adaptive global-local sparse attention mechanism that balances global context modeling and local detail preservation. Second, we propose an elastic training framework that jointly optimizes sub-DiTs of varying capacities within a unified supernetwork, allowing a single model to dynamically adjust for efficient inference across different hardware. Finally, we develop Knowledge-Guided Distribution Matching Distillation, a step-distillation pipeline that integrates the DMD objective with knowledge transfer from few-step teacher models, producing high-fidelity and low-latency generation (e.g., 4-step) suitable for real-time on-device use. Together, these contributions enable scalable, efficient, and high-quality diffusion models for deployment on diverse hardware.

"An efficient diffusion transformer framework for mobile and edge devices that maintains high-generation quality while reducing computational costs through compact architecture, elastic training, and knowledge-guided distillation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) have set new standards in image generation, yet remain impractical for on-device deployment due to their high computational and memory costs. In this work, we present an efficient DiT framework tailored for mobile and edge devices that achieves transformer-level generation quality under strict resource constraints. Our design combines three key components. First, we propose a compact DiT architecture with an adaptive global-local sparse attention mechanism that balances global context modeling and local detail preservation. Second, we propose an elastic training framework that jointly optimizes sub-DiTs of varying capacities within a unified supernetwork, allowing a single model to dynamically adjust for efficient inference across different hardware. Finally, we develop Knowledge-Guided Distribution Matching Distillation, a step-distillation pipeline that integrates the DMD objective with knowledge transfer from few-step teacher models, producing high-fidelity and low-latency generation (e.g., 4-step) suitable for real-time on-device use. Together, these contributions enable scalable, efficient, and high-quality diffusion models for deployment on diverse hardware."

Wait, let me reconsider. The paper mentions "open-source" only if it explicitly states they're releasing code/models. Let me re-read... The text doesn't explicitly mention releasing open-source contributions.

A reinforcement learning framework for text-to-visualization generation that improves chart quality and code execution by optimizing multiple objectives using post-execution feedback.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-Visualization (Text2Vis) systems translate natural language queries over tabular data into concise answers and executable visualizations. While closed-source LLMs generate functional code, the resulting charts often lack semantic alignment and clarity, qualities that can only be assessed post-execution. Open-source models struggle even more, frequently producing non-executable or visually poor outputs. Although supervised fine-tuning can improve code executability, it fails to enhance overall visualization quality, as traditional SFT loss cannot capture post-execution feedback. To address this gap, we propose RL-Text2Vis, the first reinforcement learning framework for Text2Vis generation. Built on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our method uses a novel multi-objective reward that jointly optimizes textual accuracy, code validity, and visualization quality using post-execution feedback. By training Qwen2.5 models (7B and 14B), RL-Text2Vis achieves a 22% relative improvement in chart quality over GPT-4o on the Text2Vis benchmark and boosts code execution success from 78% to 97% relative to its zero-shot baseline. Our models significantly outperform strong zero-shot and supervised baselines and also demonstrate robust generalization to out-of-domain datasets like VIS-Eval and NVBench. These results establish GRPO as an effective strategy for structured, multimodal reasoning in visualization generation. We release our code at https://github.com/vis-nlp/RL-Text2Vis.
