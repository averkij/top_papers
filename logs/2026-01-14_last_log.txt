Text:"UM-Text: Unified Multimodal Model for Image Understanding and Visual Text Editing Lichen Ma1*, Xiaolong Fu1*, GaojingZhou1, Zipeng Guo1,2, Ting Zhu1, Yichun Liu1, Yu Shi1, Jason Li1, Junshi Huang1 1JD.COM 2Sun Yat-sen University {malichen2020, fxlcumt, junshi.huang}@gmail.com 6 2 0 2 3 1 ] . [ 1 1 2 3 8 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r Abstract With the rapid advancement of image generation, visual text editing using natural language instructions has received increasing attention. The main challenge of this task is to fully understand the instruction and reference image, and thus generate visual text that is style-consistent with the image. Previous methods often involve complex steps of specifying the text content and attributes, such as font size, color, and layout, without considering the stylistic consistency with the reference image. To address this, we propose UM-Text, unified multimodal model for context understanding and visual text editing by natural language instructions. Specifically, we introduce Visual Language Model (VLM) to process the instruction and reference image, so that the text content and layout can be elaborately designed according to the context information. To generate an accurate and harmonious visual text image, we further propose the UM-Encoder to combine the embeddings of various condition information, where the combination is automatically configured by VLM according to the input instruction. During training, we propose regional consistency loss to offer more effective supervision for glyph generation on both latent and RGB space, and design tailored three-stage training strategy to further enhance model performance. In addition, we contribute the UM-DATA-200K, large-scale visual text image dataset on diverse scenes for model training. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Visual text editing and generation play crucial role in various applications"

A unified multimodal model for visual text editing that understands natural language instructions and maintains stylistic consistency with reference images through visual language modeling and contextual embedding combination.  					AI-generated summary 				 With the rapid advancement of image generation, visual text editing using natural language instructions has received increasing attention. The main challenge of this task is to fully understand the instruction and reference image, and thus generate visual text that is style-consistent with the image. Previous methods often involve complex steps of specifying the text content and attributes, such as font size, color, and layout, without considering the stylistic consistency with the reference image. To address this, we propose UM-Text, a unified multimodal model for context understanding and visual text editing by natural language instructions. Specifically, we introduce a Visual Language Model (VLM) to process the instruction and reference image, so that the text content and layout can be elaborately designed according to the context information. To generate an accurate and harmonious visual text image, we further propose the UM-Encoder to combine the embeddings of various condition information, where the combination is automatically configured by VLM according to the input instruction. During training, we propose a regional consistency loss to offer more effective supervision for glyph generation on both latent and RGB space, and design a tailored three-stage training strategy to further enhance model performance. In addition, we contribute the UM-DATA-200K, a large-scale visual text image dataset on diverse scenes for model training. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Wait, let me reconsider. Looking at the paper text more carefully:

The paper is about visual text editing using natural language instructions and multimodal learning. It discusses:
- A unified multimodal model (UM-Text)
- Visual Language Model (VLM)
- Image generation and editing
- A new dataset (UM-DATA-200K)

However, the paper does not clearly indicate that it releases open-source code, models, or frameworks to the public - it only mentions contributing a dataset. The mention of a dataset contribution alone is not sufficient to classify as OPEN_SOURCE without explicit statement about releasing code/models.

Looking at all topics again, this paper doesn't clearly fit into any of the provided categories. It's about multimodal visual text editing, which is not covered by the given topic list.
