VideoLoom is a unified video large language model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in spatial-temporal video understanding through a specialized dataset and benchmark.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents VideoLoom, a unified Video Large Language Model (Video LLM) for joint spatial-temporal understanding. To facilitate the development of fine-grained spatial and temporal localization capabilities, we curate LoomData-8.7k, a human-centric video dataset with temporally grounded and spatially localized captions. With this, VideoLoom achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across a variety of spatial and temporal benchmarks (e.g., 63.1 J&F on ReVOS for referring video object segmentation, and 48.3 R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for temporal grounding). In addition, we introduce LoomBench, a novel benchmark consisting of temporal, spatial, and compositional video-question pairs, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of Video LLMs from diverse aspects. Collectively, these contributions offer a universal and effective suite for joint spatial-temporal video understanding, setting a new standard in multimodal intelligence.

Авторы создали специальный датасет LoomData-8.7k с видео, где каждый фрагмент и объект помечены точными описаниями их положения и момента времени. Модель показывает лучшие результаты на популярных бенчмарках, включая задачи сегментации объектов и поиск событий во времени. Также представлен новый бенчмарк LoomBench для комплексной оценки видео LLM по различным аспектам пространственно-временного понимания.",
