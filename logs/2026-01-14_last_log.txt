Text:"6 2 0 2 2 1 ] . [ 1 9 8 3 7 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r On the Non-decoupling of Supervised Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning in Post-training Xueyan Niu Theory Laboratory Central Research Institute, 2012 Laboratories Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. Bo Bai Wei Han Weixi Zhang niuxueyan3@huawei.com baibo8@huawei.com harvey.hanwei@huawei.com zhangweixi1@huawei.com Abstract Post-training of large language models routinely interleaves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL). These two methods have different objectives: SFT minimizes the cross-entropy loss between model outputs and expert responses, while RL maximizes reward signals derived from human preferences or rule-based verifiers. Modern reasoning models have widely adopted the practice of alternating SFT and RL training. However, there is no theoretical account of whether they can be decoupled. We prove that decoupling is impossible in either order: (1) SFT-then-RL coupling: RL increases SFT loss under SFT optimality and (2) RL-then-SFT coupling: SFT lowers the reward achieved by RL. Experiments on Qwen3-0.6B confirm the predicted degradation, verifying that SFT and RL cannot be separated without loss of prior performance in the post-training pipeline. The capacity for reasoning and general tasks have been greatly improved in contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) thanks to post-training techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Training LLMs typically comprises two stages, self-supervised pretraining and post-training, as illustrated in Figure 1. Testtime strategies can also be applied to improve the performance of post-trained models, but they do not modify the parameters of the post-trained model. During the pretraining stage, the model acquires general language patterns, structure, grammar, factual knowledge, and reasoning abilities by processing vast amounts of textual data. This stage of LLM training demands substantial computational resources. In addit"

Large language models develop concept circuits during continual pretraining that exhibit learning and forgetting patterns, with semantically similar concepts showing stronger interference and varying transferability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Human beings primarily understand the world through concepts (e.g., dog), abstract mental representations that structure perception, reasoning, and learning. However, how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and forget such concepts during continual pretraining remains poorly understood. In this work, we study how individual concepts are acquired and forgotten, as well as how multiple concepts interact through interference and synergy. We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others. Together, our findings offer a circuit-level view of concept learning dynamics and inform the design of more interpretable and robust concept-aware training strategies for LLMs.

Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning in large language model post-training cannot be decoupled without performance degradation, as each method negatively impacts the other's effectiveness when separated.  					AI-generated summary 				 Post-training of large language models routinely interleaves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL). These two methods have different objectives: SFT minimizes the cross-entropy loss between model outputs and expert responses, while RL maximizes reward signals derived from human preferences or rule-based verifiers. Modern reasoning models have widely adopted the practice of alternating SFT and RL training. However, there is no theoretical account of whether they can be decoupled. We prove that decoupling is impossible in either order: (1) SFT-then-RL coupling: RL increases SFT loss under SFT optimality and (2) RL-then-SFT coupling: SFT lowers the reward achieved by RL. Experiments on Qwen3-0.6B confirm the predicted degradation, verifying that SFT and RL cannot be separated without loss of prior performance in the post-training
