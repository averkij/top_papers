[26.11.2024 10:11] Abstract 1. Subject-driven text-to-image generation aims to produce images of a new subject within a desired context by accurately capturing both the visual characteristics of the subject and the semantic content of a text prompt. Traditional methods rely on time- and resource-intensive fine-tuning for subject ...

[26.11.2024 10:11] Abstract 2. We present a way to learn novel concepts by only using their textual description. We call this method Knowledge Transfer. Similarly to human perception, we leverage cross-modal interaction to introduce new concepts. We hypothesize that in a pre-trained visual encoder there are enough low-level featu...

[26.11.2024 10:11] Abstract 3. Assessment and evaluation have long been critical challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). However, traditional methods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging subtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advan...

[26.11.2024 10:11] Abstract 5. Despite significant advancements in general artificial intelligence, such as GPT-4, their effectiveness in the medical domain (general medical AI, GMAI) remains constrained due to the absence of specialized medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we present GMAI-VL-5.5M, a comprehensive multim...

[26.11.2024 10:11] Abstract 6. Visual tokenizers are fundamental to image generation. They convert visual data into discrete tokens, enabling transformer-based models to excel at image generation. Despite their success, VQ-based tokenizers like VQGAN face significant limitations due to constrained vocabulary sizes. Simply expandi...

[26.11.2024 10:11] Abstract 9. This paper presents a critical examination of current approaches to replicating OpenAI's O1 model capabilities, with particular focus on the widespread but often undisclosed use of knowledge distillation techniques. While our previous work explored the fundamental technical path to O1 replication, t...

[26.11.2024 10:11] Abstract 14. A fundamental open challenge in modern LLM scaling is the lack of understanding around emergent capabilities. In particular, language model pretraining loss is known to be highly predictable as a function of compute. However, downstream capabilities are far less predictable -- sometimes even exhibit...
