Text:"FROM CISC TO RISC: LANGUAGE-MODEL GUIDED ASSEMBLY TRANSPILATION Ahmed Heakl * Chaimaa Abi * Rania Hossam Abdulrahman Mahmoud Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE 4 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 1 4 3 6 1 . 1 1 4 2 : r ABSTRACT The transition from x86 to ARM architecture is becoming increasingly common across various domains, primarily driven by ARMs energy efficiency and improved performance across traditional sectors. However, this ISA shift poses significant challenges, mainly due to the extensive legacy ecosystem of x86 software, and lack of portability across proprietary ecosystems and software stacks. This paper introduces CRT, lightweight LLM-based transpiler that automatically converts x86 assembly to ARM assembly. Our approach bridges the fundamental architectural gap between x86s CISC-based and ARMs RISC-based computing paradigms while preserving program semantics and optimizing performance. We evaluate CRT on diverse real-world applications, achieving 79.25% translation accuracy from x86 to ARMv5 on our comprehensive test suite, and 88.68% accuracy from x86 to RISC-V. In practical deployments on Apple M2 hardware (ARMv8), our transpiled code achieves 1.73x speedup compared to Apples Rosetta 2 virtualization engine, while delivering 2.41x memory efficiency and 1.47x better energy consumption. Through testing and analysis, we show that CRT successfully navigates the CISC/RISC divide, and generates correctly executable RISC code despite machine language barriers. We release our code, models, training datasets, and benchmarks at: https://ahmedheakl.github.io/asm2asm/ The ending of Moores Law and Dennard scaling has led to paradigm shift in the way modern processors are designed and architected. No longer benefiting from generational improvement in power, performance, and area efficiency (PPA), many academic and industry players are rethinking their architectural designs. This includes both introducing more specialized hardware components"

Despite significant advancements in general artificial intelligence, such as GPT-4, their effectiveness in the medical domain (general medical AI, GMAI) remains constrained due to the absence of specialized medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we present GMAI-VL-5.5M, a comprehensive multimodal medical dataset created by converting hundreds of specialized medical datasets into meticulously constructed image-text pairs. This dataset features comprehensive task coverage, diverse modalities, and high-quality image-text data. Building upon this multimodal dataset, we propose GMAI-VL, a general medical vision-language model with a progressively three-stage training strategy. This approach significantly enhances the model's ability by integrating visual and textual information, thereby improving its ability to process multimodal data and support accurate diagnosis and clinical decision-making. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GMAI-VL achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of multimodal medical tasks, such as visual question answering and medical image diagnosis. Our contributions include the development of the GMAI-VL-5.5M dataset, the introduction of the GMAI-VL model, and the establishment of new benchmarks in multiple medical domains. Code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/uni-medical/GMAI-VL.

Assessment and evaluation have long been critical challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). However, traditional methods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging subtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where LLMs are leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based judgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging field. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output perspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore LLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to judge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and highlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable insights and inspire future research in this promising research area.

Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most popular modalities for medical imaging. By far, CT images have contributed to the largest publicly available datasets for volumetric medical segmentation tasks, covering full-body anatomical structures. Large amounts of full-body CT images provide the opportunity to pre-train powerful models, e.g., STU-Net pre-trained in a supervised fashion, to segment numerous anatomical structures. However, it remains unclear in which conditions these pre-trained models can be transferred to various downstream medical segmentation tasks, particularly segmenting the other modalities and diverse targets. To address this problem, a large-scale benchmark for comprehensive evaluation is crucial for finding these conditions. Thus, we collected 87 public datasets varying in modality, target, and sample size to evaluate the transfer ability of full-body CT pre-trained models. We then employed a representative model, STU-Net with multiple model scales, to conduct transfer learning across modalities and targets. Our experimental results show that (1) there may be a bottleneck effect concerning the dataset size in fine-tuning, with more improvement on both small- and large-scale datasets than medium-size ones. (2) Models pre-trained on full-body CT demonstrate effective modality transfer, adapting well to other modalities such as MRI. (3) Pre-training on the full-body CT not only supports strong performance in structure detection but also shows efficacy in lesion detection, showcasing adaptability across target tasks. We hope that this large-scale open evaluation of transfer learning can direct future research in volumetric medical image segmentation.

Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts (MH-MoE) demonstrates superior performance by using the multi-head mechanism to collectively attend to information from various representation spaces within different experts. In this paper, we present a novel implementation of MH-MoE that maintains both FLOPs and parameter parity with sparse Mixture of Experts models. Experimental results on language models show that the new implementation yields quality improvements over both vanilla MoE and fine-grained MoE models. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that MH-MoE is compatible with 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BitNet.

The transition from x86 to ARM architecture is becoming increasingly common across various domains, primarily driven by ARM's energy efficiency and improved performance across traditional sectors. However, this ISA shift poses significant challenges, mainly due to the extensive legacy ecosystem of x86 software and lack of portability across proprietary ecosystems and software stacks. This paper introduces CRT, a lightweight LLM-based transpiler that automatically converts x86 assembly to ARM assembly. Our approach bridges the fundamental architectural gap between x86's CISC-based and ARM's RISC-based computing paradigms while preserving program semantics and optimizing performance. We evaluate CRT on diverse real-world applications, achieving 79.25% translation accuracy from x86 to ARMv5 on our comprehensive test suite, and an 88.68% accuracy from x86 to RISC-V. In practical deployments on Apple M2 hardware (ARMv8), our transpiled code achieves 1.73times speedup compared to Apple's Rosetta 2 virtualization engine, while delivering 2.41times memory efficiency and 1.47times better energy consumption. Through testing and analysis, we show that CRT successfully navigates the CISC/RISC divide and generates correctly executable RISC code despite machine ``language'' barriers. We release our code, models, training datasets, and benchmarks at: https://ahmedheakl.github.io/asm2asm/.
