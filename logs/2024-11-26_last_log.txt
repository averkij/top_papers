Our method consists of Data Engine powered by 2D foundation models SAM & Gemini that automatically annotates 3D assets from the web. Using the labeled data, FIND3D trains transformer-based point cloud model with contrastive-based training recipe. Our method can segment diverse 3D objects with rich set of part queries, such as the easel, as well as in-the-wild 3D reconstructions obtained via imageto-3D methods, such as the push car captured with an iPhone and the capybara with hat generated by DALL-E, shown at the bottom right.

We study open-world part segmentation in 3D: segmenting any part in any object based on any text query. Prior methods are limited in object categories and part vocabularies. Recent advances in AI have demonstrated effective open-world recognition capabilities in 2D. Inspired by this progress, we propose an open-world, direct-prediction model for 3D part segmentation that can be applied zero-shot to any object. Our approach, called Find3D, trains a general-category point embedding model on large-scale 3D assets from the internet without any human annotation. It combines a data engine, powered by foundation models for annotating data, with a contrastive training method. We achieve strong performance and generalization across multiple datasets, with up to a 3x improvement in mIoU over the next best method. Our model is 6x to over 300x faster than existing baselines. To encourage research in general-category open-world 3D part segmentation, we also release a benchmark for general objects and parts. Project website: https://ziqi-ma.github.io/find3dsite/
