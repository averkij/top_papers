Visual tokenizers are fundamental to image generation. They convert visual data into discrete tokens, enabling transformer-based models to excel at image generation. Despite their success, VQ-based tokenizers like VQGAN face significant limitations due to constrained vocabulary sizes. Simply expanding the codebook often leads to training instability and diminishing performance gains, making scalability a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce Factorized Quantization (FQ), a novel approach that revitalizes VQ-based tokenizers by decomposing a large codebook into multiple independent sub-codebooks. This factorization reduces the lookup complexity of large codebooks, enabling more efficient and scalable visual tokenization. To ensure each sub-codebook captures distinct and complementary information, we propose a disentanglement regularization that explicitly reduces redundancy, promoting diversity across the sub-codebooks. Furthermore, we integrate representation learning into the training process, leveraging pretrained vision models like CLIP and DINO to infuse semantic richness into the learned representations. This design ensures our tokenizer captures diverse semantic levels, leading to more expressive and disentangled representations. Experiments show that the proposed FQGAN model substantially improves the reconstruction quality of visual tokenizers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We further demonstrate that this tokenizer can be effectively adapted into auto-regressive image generation. https://showlab.github.io/FQGAN

This paper presents a critical examination of current approaches to replicating OpenAI's O1 model capabilities, with particular focus on the widespread but often undisclosed use of knowledge distillation techniques. While our previous work explored the fundamental technical path to O1 replication, this study reveals how simple distillation from O1's API, combined with supervised fine-tuning, can achieve superior performance on complex mathematical reasoning tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show that a base model fine-tuned on simply tens of thousands of samples O1-distilled long-thought chains outperforms O1-preview on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) with minimal technical complexity. Moreover, our investigation extends beyond mathematical reasoning to explore the generalization capabilities of O1-distilled models across diverse tasks: hallucination, safety and open-domain QA. Notably, despite training only on mathematical problem-solving data, our models demonstrated strong generalization to open-ended QA tasks and became significantly less susceptible to sycophancy after fine-tuning. We deliberately make this finding public to promote transparency in AI research and to challenge the current trend of obscured technical claims in the field. Our work includes: (1) A detailed technical exposition of the distillation process and its effectiveness, (2) A comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and categorizing O1 replication attempts based on their technical transparency and reproducibility, (3) A critical discussion of the limitations and potential risks of over-relying on distillation approaches, our analysis culminates in a crucial bitter lesson: while the pursuit of more capable AI systems is important, the development of researchers grounded in first-principles thinking is paramount.
