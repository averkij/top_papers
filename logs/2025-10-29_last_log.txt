Text:"Game-TARS: Pretrained Foundation Models for Scalable Generalist Multimodal Game AgentsSee Contributions section for full author list.We present Game-TARS, generalist game agent trained with unified, scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboardmouse inputs. Unlike APIor GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include decaying continual loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and multimodal data.

RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework using end-to-end omni-modal LLMs, improves robotic manipulation by inferring user intentions from spoken dialogue, environmental sounds, and visual cues.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation. Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue, environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition, while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance.

However, these search agents assume user queries are complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search. Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context, exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold, revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents.

Latent Sketchpad enhances Multimodal Large Language Models with an internal visual scratchpad, enabling generative visual thought and improved reasoning performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this, we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone. It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project page: https://latent-sketchpad.github.io/.

ProMoE, an MoE framework with conditional and prototypical routing, enhances expert specialization in Diffusion Transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet.  					AI-generated summary 				 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be made publicly available.

Language tokens are semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be made publicly available."

Group Relative Attention Guidance enhances image editing quality by modulating token deltas in Diffusion-in-Transformer models, providing fine-grained control over editing intensity.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at https://github.com/little-misfit/GRAG-Image-Editing.

VisCoder2, a family of multi-language visualization models, outperforms open-source baselines and approaches proprietary models by leveraging VisCode-Multi-679K and VisPlotBench for iterative self-debugging and multi-turn correction.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled coding agents capable of generating, executing, and revising visualization code. However, existing models often fail in practical workflows due to limited language coverage, unreliable execution, and lack of iterative correction mechanisms. Progress has been constrained by narrow datasets and benchmarks that emphasize single-round generation and single-language tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce three complementary resources for advancing visualization coding agents. VisCode-Multi-679K is a large-scale, supervised dataset containing 679K validated and executable visualization samples with multi-turn correction dialogues across 12 programming languages. VisPlotBench is a benchmark for systematic evaluation, featuring executable tasks, rendered outputs, and protocols for both initial generation and multi-round self-debug. Finally, we present VisCoder2, a family of multi-language visualization models trained on VisCode-Multi-679K. Experiments show that VisCoder2 significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4.1, with further gains from iterative self-debug, reaching 82.4% overall execution pass rate at the 32B scale, particularly in symbolic or compiler-dependent languages.

ParallelMuse enhances problem-solving by efficiently reusing paths and compressing reasoning in deep information-seeking agents, improving performance and reducing token consumption.  					AI-generated summary 				 Parallel thinking expands exploration breadth, complementing the deep exploration of information-seeking (IS) agents to further enhance problem-solving capability. However, conventional parallel thinking faces two key challenges in this setting: inefficiency from repeatedly rolling out from scratch, and difficulty in integrating long-horizon reasoning trajectories during answer generation, as limited context capacity prevents full consideration of the reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose ParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first stage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences into functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and branching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed Reasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final answer. Experiments across multiple open-source agents and benchmarks demonstrate up to 62% performance improvement with a 10--30% reduction in exploratory token consumption.

"ParallelMuse enhances problem-solving by efficiently reusing paths and compressing reasoning in deep information-seeking agents, improving performance and reducing token consumption.  					AI-generated summary 				 Parallel thinking expands exploration breadth, complementing the deep exploration of information-seeking (IS) agents to further enhance problem-solving capability. However, conventional parallel thinking faces two key challenges in this setting: inefficiency from repeatedly rolling out from scratch, and difficulty in integrating long-horizon reasoning trajectories during answer generation, as limited context capacity prevents full consideration of the reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose ParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first stage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences into functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and branching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed Reasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final answer. Experiments across multiple open-source agents and benchmarks demonstrate up to 62% performance improvement with a 10--30% reduction in exploratory token consumption."

AgentFold, a novel proactive context management paradigm for LLM-based web agents, achieves superior performance on long-horizon tasks through dynamic context folding, surpassing larger models and proprietary agents.  					AI-generated summary 				 LLM-based web agents show immense promise for information seeking, yet their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental trade-off in context management. Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical details. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent benchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual pre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH. Notably, this performance not only surpasses or matches open-source models of a dramatically larger scale, such as the DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B, but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like OpenAI's o4-mini.

WebLeaper framework improves information seeking efficiency and effectiveness by constructing high-coverage tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories using tree-structured reasoning and curated Wikipedia tables.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a transformative approach for open-ended problem solving, with information seeking (IS) being a core capability that enables autonomous reasoning and decision-making. While prior research has largely focused on improving retrieval depth, we observe that current IS agents often suffer from low search efficiency, which in turn constrains overall performance. A key factor underlying this inefficiency is the sparsity of target entities in training tasks, which limits opportunities for agents to learn and generalize efficient search behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose WebLeaper, a framework for constructing high-coverage IS tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories. We formulate IS as a tree-structured reasoning problem, enabling a substantially larger set of target entities to be embedded within a constrained context. Leveraging curated Wikipedia tables, we propose three variants for synthesizing IS tasks, Basic, Union, and Reverse-Union, to systematically increase both IS efficiency and efficacy. Finally, we curate training trajectories by retaining only those that are simultaneously accurate and efficient, ensuring that the model is optimized for both correctness and search performance. Extensive experiments on both basic and comprehensive settings, conducted on five IS benchmarks, BrowserComp, GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch, WideSearch, and Seal-0, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over strong baselines.

A ZPD-guided data synthesis approach enhances large language model capabilities by training them on tasks just beyond their current abilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance on complex benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Training large language model agents on tasks at the frontier of their capabilities is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. We introduce a data synthesis approach inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which defines this frontier as tasks an LLM cannot solve alone but can master with guidance. To operationalize this, we present the AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality, multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. This engine supports both continued pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and targeted post-training on complex reasoning tasks. From the same framework, we derive the ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark designed to evaluate agent capabilities on these frontier tasks. We train AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model on our synthesized data, which achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary agents. Our work demonstrates that a ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents.

"A ZPD-guided data synthesis approach enhances large language model capabilities by training them on tasks just beyond their current abilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance on complex benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Training large language model agents on tasks at the frontier of their capabilities is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. We introduce a data synthesis approach inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which defines this frontier as tasks an LLM cannot solve alone but can master with guidance. To operationalize this, we present the AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality, multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. This engine supports both continued pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and targeted post-training on complex reasoning tasks. From the same framework, we derive the ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark designed to evaluate agent capabilities on these frontier tasks. We train AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model on our synthesized data, which achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary agents. Our work demonstrates that a ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents."

Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO) enhances search agents by incorporating entity information into the reward function, improving accuracy and efficiency in knowledge-intensive tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative "near-miss" samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to effectively learn from these "near-misses". Experiments on diverse question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls, demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search agents.

Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified action space, achieves superior performance across various domains and benchmarks through large-scale pre-training and efficient reasoning strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified, scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs. Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.

AI-generated summary 				 Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods, such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments. Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a reliable and robust source for agentic learning.
