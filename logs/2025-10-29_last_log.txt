A new dataset and frequency-aware post-training method improve fine-grained detail synthesis in ultra-high-resolution text-to-image diffusion models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the first challenge, we introduce UltraHR-100K, a high-quality dataset of 100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we design (i) Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS) to focus learning on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) Soft-Weighting Frequency Regularization (SWFR), which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/UltraHR-100k{here}.

OAT, a deep-learning framework combining autoencoder, neural-field decoder, and latent-diffusion model, achieves fast and general topology optimization with high performance across various conditions and resolutions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Structural topology optimization (TO) is central to engineering design but remains computationally intensive due to complex physics and hard constraints. Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary aspect ratios, resolutions, volume fractions, loads, and fixtures. OAT combines a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for physics-aware topology optimization and provide a large-scale dataset to spur further research in generative modeling for inverse design.

  "desc": "Представлена OAT — framework на основе deep learning для топологической оптимизации инженерных конструкций, который объединяет autoencoder, neural-field декодер и latent-diffusion модель. Система обучена на датасете OpenTO из 2.2 миллионов оптимизированных структур и работает с произвольными разрешениями, соотношениями сторон и граничными условиями. OAT снижает среднюю податливость конструкций до 90% по сравнению с предыдущими методами и выполняет inference менее чем за секунду на одном GPU. Это первая foundation model для топологической оптимизации, которая работает с любыми параметрами без необходимости дополнительной оптимизации.",
