[ 1 0 0 5 1 2 . 9 0 5 2 : r Chasing the Tail: Effective Rubric-based Reward Modeling for Large Language Model Post-Training Junkai Zhang*,2, Zihao Wang*1, Lin Gui*3, Swarnashree Mysore Sathyendra1, Jaehwan Jeong1, Victor Veitch3, Wei Wang2, Yunzhong He1, Bing Liu1, and Lifeng Jin1 1Scale AI, Inc. 2University of California, Los Angeles 3University of Chicago Abstract Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from reward over-optimization, where policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the inability to reliably distinguish excellent responses from merely great ones. This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them yields misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this, we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing among great and diverse responses, and introduce workflow to implement this idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training improvements. In this paper, we are interested in how to produce reward models that are effective when used for LLM post-training. reward model is function that takes prompt and response and produces score quantifying how good that response is for the prompt. In post-training, we then align language model to the reward by reinforcement-learning type procedure. The fundamental challenge here is that, in many settings, it is nearly inevitable that the reward model will be an imperfect proxy fo"

Rubric-based rewards mitigate reward over-optimization in reinforcement fine-tuning by leveraging off-policy examples while maintaining reward reliability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from reward over-optimization, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones. This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this, we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training improvements. Our code can be accessed at https://github.com/Jun-Kai-Zhang/rubrics.git .

  "desc": "Исследование посвящено проблеме чрезмерной оптимизации наград в reinforcement fine-tuning, когда модель начинает обманывать систему наград для получения высоких баллов при низком качестве ответов. Авторы показывают, что ключевая проблема заключается в неправильной спецификации наград в области высоких значений - неспособности надежно различать отличные ответы от просто хороших. Для решения этой проблемы предлагается использовать награды на основе рубрик, которые могут использовать off-policy примеры и остаются нечувствительными к их артефактам. Экспериментально доказано, что такой подход существенно снижает переоптимизацию наград и улучшает качество post-training LLM.",
