INTRODUCTION This work addresses the problem of locating distant objects from series of camera-based detections from known locations and orientations. At glance, the problem of locating target objects based on multiperspective imagery seems fairly well-addressed. The earlier proposed methods typically operate as optimisation problems where the object locations of individual keypoints are determined using set of images and known camera poses. Alternatively, full scene 3D reconstruction or dense depth estimation methods have been used for similar problems. However, the task at hand, presented in this work, is specific to far-away objects which have been detected with separate image segmentation models, such as neural networks which inherently produce noisy segments. Other sources of noise occur from possible target object dynamics and the camera-pose estimation methods. In addition, due to the nature of the target detection models, direct correspondence between features from consecutive frames does not hold. The motivation for this work originates from drone-based wildfire detection, in which the position of the drone-carried This research was funded by the Research Council of Finland within the projects DRONE4TREE - Autonomous drone solutions for single treebased forest management (decision no. 359404) and Fireman (decision no. 346710) and with grants (no. 339730 and 362408). The FireMan project is funded under the EUs Recovery and Resilience Facility, that promotes the green and digital transitions through research. 1Julius Pesonen and Eija Honkavaara are with the Department of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Finnish Geospatial Research Institute, National Land Survey of Finland, Espoo, Finland julius.pesonen@nls.fi 2Julius Pesonen and Arno Solin are with the Department of Computer Science, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland Moving camera Estimated positions Fig. 1. We propose hybrid approach for localising distant objects/events (such as wildfire smoke) from sequences of frames and GNSS-estimated poses from moving RGB camera (example frames with masked smoke shown on top-right). camera is estimated using GNSS measurements and known dynamics of the drone camera setup. Our previous work showed that wildfire smoke can be detected from almost ten kilometres away using only drone-carried resources [1]. Pairing the segmentation model with lightweight target localisation method enables fully on-board wildfire detection and localisation. This enables the wildfire detection system to be used in areas of poor telecommunication where cloudbased computing can not be relied on. The sketch in Figure 1 illustrates use case of UAV scanning for wildfires (sketch by DALL-E 3) with masked RGB images (real data). To combat the noise induced by the camera and image observation systems, we focus on Bayesian filters. They enable reliable modelling of various noise sources, and with particle filters in particular, more complex observation and target dynamics can be modelled. The use of particle filters in camera-based 3D localisation literature has been limited. Specifically, for locating distant objects from moving camera, there appears to be lack of extensive research. This work extends the literature on filter-based target localisation from moving camera by addressing object the problem of distant objects detected by separate models. We propose using particle filters to iteratively improve the localisation and uncertainty estimation of the target objects 3D position. Using both simulations and drone-captured image sequence with GNSS-estimated camera positions, we show that the method can locate multiple target objects from moving camera segmentation sequences despite the various sources of noise. II. RELATED WORK The task at hand can be thought of as form of camerabased multiview 3D reconstruction. The earlier developments of 3D object reconstruction from multiview imagery have been well documented by Hartley and Zisserman [2]. These methods relied on point correspondence, well-estimated camera parameters, and bundle adjustments. Later developments, such as COLMAP [3] and 3D Gaussian splatting [4], have greatly improved the structure from motion map generation and 3D modelling, respectively. Unfortunately, the methods still require finding large number of point correspondences between frames, making them computationally heavy for iterative real-time localisation using edge devices, which is desirable in, for example, aerial robotic applications. The 3D reconstruction methods have been poorly studied in the context of smaller and more distant objects. In such situations, any noise in the camera pose estimation causes larger errors in the final reconstruction. This suggests that Bayesian filtering-based solutions could offer feasible solutions. Besides the camera pose estimation errors, typical modern camera-based sensing solutions leverage neural network models for detecting key features, which complicates keypoint matching between frames. Even though the observed object, in this study, is assumed to be static, the problem relates to object tracking, as were interested i"

Restoring fine-tuning to a breadth-first pipeline with mini-batch optimization and localized tuning parameters improves its effectiveness for model editing, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Fine-tuning, a foundational method for adapting large language models, has long been considered ineffective for model editing. Here, we challenge this belief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent limitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature of the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each sample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first pipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces interference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply restoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based) pipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness for model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from suboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through systematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and effective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our knowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x beyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities. By clarifying a long-standing misconception and introducing a principled localized tuning strategy, we advance fine-tuning from an underestimated baseline to a leading method for model editing, establishing a solid foundation for future research.

Particle filters enable 3D object localization using camera poses and image segments, suitable for drone-based surveillance with limited computational resources.  					AI-generated summary 				 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image segmentation model.

The results showed that a particle filter can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image segmentation model."
