Text:"See, Point, Fly: Learning-Free VLM Framework for Universal Unmanned Aerial Navigation Chih Yao Hu2 Shr-Ruei Tsai1 Yang-Sen Lin1 Yuna Lee1 Chin-Yang Lin1 Kuan-Wen Chen1 Chih-Hai Su1 Jie-Ying Lee Tsung-Wei Ke2 Yu-Lun Liu1 5 2 0 2 6 2 ] . [ 1 3 5 6 2 2 . 9 0 5 2 : r 1 National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, 2 National Taiwan University https://spf-web.pages.dev Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), training-free aerial visionand-language navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that treat action prediction as text generation task, our key insight is to consider action prediction for AVLN as 2D spatial grounding task. SPF harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF performs navigation in closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets new state of the art in DRL simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong baselines by large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev Keywords: Vision-Language Models, Zero-shot UAV Navigation, 2D-to-3D Waypoint Prompting The rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has revolutionized applications from environmental monitoring to security patrol. However, autonomous UAV navigation remains c"

See, Point, Fly (SPF) is a training-free aerial vision-and-language navigation framework that treats action prediction as a 2D spatial grounding task, outperforming existing methods in both simulation and real-world evaluations.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev

A new method leverages diffusion transformers' attention scores for referring segmentation without fine-tuning or additional training, improving performance through stop word filtering and attention redistribution.  					AI-generated summary 				 Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile, large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information, making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise. Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods, establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional components.
