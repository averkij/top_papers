Text:"TUN3D: Towards Real-World Scene Understanding from Unposed Images Anton Konushin1, Nikita Drozdov1, Bulat Gabdullin2, Alexey Zakharov1, Anna Vorontsova, Danila Rukhovich3, Maksim Kolodiazhnyi1 1Lomonosov Moscow State University; 2Higher School of Economics; 3Institute of Mechanics, Armenia 5 2 0 2 3 2 ] . [ 1 8 8 3 1 2 . 9 0 5 2 : r Abstract Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of compact yet semantically rich spatial representation of scene. Existing approaches typically rely on point cloud input, which poses major limitation since most consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view images as input, and does not require groundtruth camera poses or depth supervision. Our approach builds on lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout estimation, leveraging novel and effective parametric wall representation. Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D significantly advances layout estimation, setting new benchmark in holistic indoor scene understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/col14m/tun3d. I. INTRODUCTION Indoor scene understanding is long-standing computer vision task, with applications in robotics, AR/VR, interior design, real estate and property inspection. Many real-world scenarios require only compact yet informative structural description of the scene: the room layout (walls, floor, ceiling) and the locations and categories of major object"

TUN3D is a method for joint layout estimation and 3D object detection using multi-view images without depth sensors or ground-truth camera poses, achieving state-of-the-art performance on indoor scene understanding benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation. Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic indoor scene understanding.

ERGO, a two-stage reasoning pipeline, efficiently processes high-resolution images by focusing on task-relevant regions, improving accuracy and speed compared to existing models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end, we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V* benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a 3x inference speedup.
