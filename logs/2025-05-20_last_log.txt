[20.05.2025 16:14] Abstract 0. In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm, termed Chain-of-Model (CoM), which incorporates the causal relationship into the hidden states of each layer as a chain style, thereby introducing great scaling efficiency in model training and inference flexibility in deployment. We introduce the...

[20.05.2025 16:14] Abstract 1. Recently, large reasoning models have achieved impressive performance on various tasks by employing human-like deep thinking.
