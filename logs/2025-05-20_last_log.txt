Text:"5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 8 5 0 2 1 . 5 0 5 2 : r Tiny QA Benchmark++: Ultra-Lightweight, Synthetic Multilingual Dataset Generation & Smoke-Tests for Continuous LLM Evaluation Vincent Koc Comet ML, Inc. New York, NY, USA vincentk@comet.com Abstract Tiny QA Benchmark++ (TQB++) is an ultra-lightweight evaluation suite designed to expose critical failures in Large Language Model (LLM) systems within seconds, contrasting with extensive benchmarks like MMLU or BIG-Bench. At its heart lies <20KB golden dataset of 52 hand-crafted English Question-Answering (QA) triples, ideal for rapid CI/CD checks and prompt engineering. This paper details the evolution into Tiny QA Benchmark++, which significantly expands upon the original TQB. Key enhancements include: (i) synthetic, on-demand generation toolkita Python LiteLLM script (<300 lines)that produces schema-validated micro-benchmarks in any language, domain, or difficulty, with SHA-256 hashing for provenance; and (ii) pre-built multilingual packs <20KB for Arabic (AR), German (DE), English (EN), Spanish (ES), French (FR), Japanese (JA), Russian (RU), Korean (KO), Portuguese (PT), Turkish (TR), and Chinese (ZH), enabling immediate cross-lingual smoke tests. We position TQB++ as the LLM analogue of software unit tests. Empirically, top-tier models achieve high accuracy ( 90% Exact Match) on the core English set, while performance significantly varies for low-resource languages, demonstrating TQB++s utility in rapidly detecting regressions or quality shifts in LLMOps workflows. The dataset, generator script, and related tools are released under open-source licenses (see Section 1.1 for details) and hosted on the Hugging Face Hub (https://huggingface.co /datasets/vincentkoc/tiny_qa_benchmark_pp) and GitHub (https://github.com/v incentkoc/tiny_qa_benchmark_pp) (Koc, 2025e), promoting accessible and continuous quality assurance in modern LLMOps.

[20.05.2025 10:13] Abstract 0. In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm, termed Chain-of-Model (CoM), which incorporates the causal relationship into the hidden states of each layer as a chain style, thereby introducing great scaling efficiency in model training and inference flexibility in deployment. We introduce the...

[20.05.2025 10:13] Abstract 1. Recently, large reasoning models have achieved impressive performance on various tasks by employing human-like deep thinking. However, the lengthy thinking process substantially increases inference overhead, making efficiency a critical bottleneck. In this work, we first demonstrate that NoThinking,...

Early cavemen relied on gestures, vocalizations, and simple signals to coordinate, plan, avoid predators, and share resources. Today, humans collaborate using complex languages to achieve remarkable results. What drives this evolution in communication? How does language emerge, adapt, and become vital for teamwork? Understanding the origins of language remains a challenge. A leading hypothesis in linguistics and anthropology posits that language evolved to meet the ecological and social demands of early human cooperation. Language did not arise in isolation, but through shared survival goals. Inspired by this view, we investigate the emergence of language in multi-agent Foraging Games. These environments are designed to reflect the cognitive and ecological constraints believed to have influenced the evolution of communication. Agents operate in a shared grid world with only partial knowledge about other agents and the environment, and must coordinate to complete games like picking up high-value targets or executing temporally ordered actions. Using end-to-end deep reinforcement learning, agents learn both actions and communication strategies from scratch. We find that agents develop communication protocols with hallmark features of natural language: arbitrariness, interchangeability, displacement, cultural transmission, and compositionality. We quantify each property and analyze how different factors, such as population size and temporal dependencies, shape specific aspects of the emergent language. Our framework serves as a platform for studying how language can evolve from partial observability, temporal reasoning, and cooperative goals in embodied multi-agent settings. We will release all data, code, and models publicly.

Tiny QA Benchmark++ (TQB++) presents an ultra-lightweight, multilingual smoke-test suite designed to give large-language-model (LLM) pipelines a unit-test style safety net dataset that runs in seconds with minimal cost. Born out of the tight feedback-loop demands building the Comet Opik prompt-optimization SDK, where waiting on heavyweight benchmarks breaks developer flow. TQB++ couples a 52-item English gold set (less than 20 kB) with a tiny synthetic-data generator pypi package built on provider-agnostic LiteLLM. The generator lets practitioners mint their own tiny packs in any language, domain, or difficulty, while ten ready-made packs already cover Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish. Every dataset ships with Croissant metadata and plug-and-play files for OpenAI-Evals, LangChain, and standard CI tools, so teams can drop deterministic micro-benchmarks directly into pull-request gates, prompt-engineering loops, and production dashboards without touching GPU budgets. A complete TQB++ run adds only a few seconds to pipeline latency yet reliably flags prompt-template errors, tokenizer drift, and fine-tuning side-effects long before full-scale suites like MMLU or BIG-Bench would finish configuring. The entire framework is released to accelerate continuous, resource-efficient quality assurance across the generative-AI ecosystem.
