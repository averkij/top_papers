Text:"5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 2 8 0 2 1 . 5 0 5 2 : r Model Merging in Pre-training of Large Language ModelsFull author list in ContributionsModel merging has emerged as promising technique for enhancing large language models, though its application in large-scale pre-training remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present comprehensive investigation of model merging techniques during the pre-training process. Through extensive experiments with both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures ranging from millions to over 100 billion parameters, we demonstrate that merging checkpoints trained with constant learning rates not only achieves significant performance improvements but also enables accurate prediction of annealing behavior. These improvements lead to both more efficient model development and significantly lower training costs. Our detailed ablation studies on merging strategies and hyperparameters provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms while uncovering novel applications. Through comprehensive experimental analysis, we offer the open-source community practical pre-training guidelines for effective model merging. Date: May 18, 2025 Correspondence: Yunshui Li at liyunshui@bytedance.comModern large language models (LLMs) [1, 13, 37, 41, 49] have demonstrated remarkable capabilities with widespread applications across diverse tasks. Despite their exceptional performance in fundamental tasks, LLMs still face several critical challenges, including the extensive pre-training costs, discounted effectiveness of domain-specific post-training, imprecisely-predictable performance scaling, as well as the instability of large-scale training. Model merging [50], as relatively young topic, presents promising approach to alleviate these practical challenges. Recently, the benefits of model merging have been primarily studied in the post-training stage, where several models fine-tuned on different downstream tasks are combined into single but more versatile model [19, 52, 58]. For example, using the DARE [52] method to merge WizardLM [46] with WizardMath [29] shows significant performance enhancement on GSM8K [7], raising its score from 2.2 to 66.3. In contrast, research on model merging during the pre-training phase remains scarce. Such pre-training merging typically involves combining checkpoints from single training trajectory, as explored in LAWA [23] which utilizes model merging to accelerate the LLM training. However, as the model and data scales dramatically, independent researchers struggle to evaluate model mergings impact on large-scale models, mainly due to limited access to intermediate checkpoints from extensive pre-training. Although DeepSeek [25] and LLaMA-3 [12] have both indicated their employment of model merging techniques for model development, detailed information regarding these techniques has not been publicly disclosed. 1 In this work, we mainly focus on model merging during the pre-training stage, introducing Pre-trained Model Average (PMA), novel strategy for model-level weight merging during pre-training. To comprehensively evaluate PMA, we trained diverse set of LLMs of varying sizes and architectures from scratch, including Dense models [12] with parameters spanning from 411M to 70B, as well as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures [39] with activated/total parameters ranging from 0.7B/7B to 20B/200B. We first investigate the performance impact of PMA and establish systematic evaluations across different phases of the warmup-stable-decay (WSD) learning schedule, which lately becomes popular choice of lr scheduler for LLM pre-training since [16]. Experimental results demonstrate that model merging during the stable training phase yields consistent performance gains at different training steps. More remarkably, applying PMA at early-stage of the cosine-decay phase usually achieve comparable or even superior performance to their final-stage annealing counterparts. These findings suggest that during the extensively lengthy pre-training stage with constant lr, PMA can serve as fast, reliable yet low-cost simulator for the annealed performance, enabling both faster validation cycles and significant computational savings. Building upon our PMA framework, we first evaluate its performance with various prevalent merging strategies, including Simple Moving Average (SMA) [21], Weighted Moving Average (WMA) [33] and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) [18]. Notably, our experiments demonstrate that the performance differences among these methods gradually become negligible. We further investigate how these important factors of PMA, namely, the interval between each merging checkpoint, the number of models involved in merging, and the size of the model, would affect merging performance. Our analysis reveals two important findings: First, the optimal merging interval exhibits clear scaling relationship with model size. Second, incorporating more checkpoints in the merging process consistently improves performance once training is completed. Furthermore, we also investigated whether PMA could produce more effective initialization weights for the consecutive continued training (CT) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT) [43] stages to enhance the downstream model performance. We practically observed that entering CT and SFT stages with PMA applied could yield smoother GradNorm curves, which thus helps stabilize the training dynamics yet without harming the performance, compared to initializing these stages with the latest available checkpoint as usual. This finding inspire novel application of model merging for training stabilization, which we dubbed as PMA-init. We demonstrate that in scenarios when the LLM training experiences severe irrecoverable loss spikes with broken training dynamics, applying PMA-init over preceding checkpoints to resume training, enables reliable recovery from unstable training trajectories. In summary, our paper makes the following key contributions: We present the Pre-trained Model Averaging (PMA) strategy, novel framework for model merging during LLM pre-training. Through extensive experiments across model scales (from millions to over 100B parameters), we demonstrate that merging checkpoints from the stable training phase produces consistent and significant performance improvements. We delved into novel applications of model merging for weight initialization (PMA-init), to help stabilize training process without harming the downstream"

Model merging has emerged as a promising technique for enhancing large language models, though its application in large-scale pre-training remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of model merging techniques during the pre-training process. Through extensive experiments with both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures ranging from millions to over 100 billion parameters, we demonstrate that merging checkpoints trained with constant learning rates not only achieves significant performance improvements but also enables accurate prediction of annealing behavior. These improvements lead to both more efficient model development and significantly lower training costs. Our detailed ablation studies on merging strategies and hyperparameters provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms while uncovering novel applications. Through comprehensive experimental analysis, we offer the open-source community practical pre-training guidelines for effective model merging.

"Model merging has emerged as a promising technique for enhancing large language models, though its application in large-scale pre-training remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of model merging techniques during the pre-training process. Through extensive experiments with both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures ranging from millions to over 100 billion parameters, we demonstrate that merging checkpoints trained with constant learning rates not only achieves significant performance improvements but also enables accurate prediction of annealing behavior. These improvements lead to both more efficient model development and significantly lower training costs. Our detailed ablation studies on merging strategies and hyperparameters provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms while uncovering novel applications. Through comprehensive experimental analysis, we offer the open-source community practical pre-training guidelines for effective model merging."

Preference datasets are essential for training general-domain, instruction-following language models with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Each subsequent data release raises expectations for future data collection, meaning there is a constant need to advance the quality and diversity of openly available preference data. To address this need, we introduce HelpSteer3-Preference, a permissively licensed (CC-BY-4.0), high-quality, human-annotated preference dataset comprising of over 40,000 samples. These samples span diverse real-world applications of large language models (LLMs), including tasks relating to STEM, coding and multilingual scenarios. Using HelpSteer3-Preference, we train Reward Models (RMs) that achieve top performance on RM-Bench (82.4%) and JudgeBench (73.7%). This represents a substantial improvement (~10% absolute) over the previously best-reported results from existing RMs. We demonstrate HelpSteer3-Preference can also be applied to train Generative RMs and how policy models can be aligned with RLHF using our RMs. Dataset (CC-BY-4.0): https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer3#preference

Homograph disambiguation remains a significant challenge in grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, especially for low-resource languages. This challenge is twofold: (1) creating balanced and comprehensive homograph datasets is labor-intensive and costly, and (2) specific disambiguation strategies introduce additional latency, making them unsuitable for real-time applications such as screen readers and other accessibility tools. In this paper, we address both issues. First, we propose a semi-automated pipeline for constructing homograph-focused datasets, introduce the HomoRich dataset generated through this pipeline, and demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to enhance a state-of-the-art deep learning-based G2P system for Persian. Second, we advocate for a paradigm shift - utilizing rich offline datasets to inform the development of fast, rule-based methods suitable for latency-sensitive accessibility applications like screen readers. To this end, we improve one of the most well-known rule-based G2P systems, eSpeak, into a fast homograph-aware version, HomoFast eSpeak. Our results show an approximate 30% improvement in homograph disambiguation accuracy for the deep learning-based and eSpeak systems.
