Text:"REINFORCE++: SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT APPROACH FOR ALIGNING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS 5 2 0 2 4 ] . [ 1 2 6 2 3 0 . 1 0 5 2 : r Jian Hu janhu9527@gmail.comReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as critical approach for aligning large language models with human preferences, witnessing rapid algorithmic evolution through methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We present REINFORCE++, an enhanced variant of the classical REINFORCE algorithm that incorporates key optimization techniques from PPO while eliminating the need for critic network. REINFORCE++ achieves three primary objectives: (1) simplicity (2) enhanced training stability, and (3) reduced computational overhead. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that REINFORCE++ exhibits superior stability compared to GRPO and achieves greater computational efficiency than PPO while maintaining comparable performance. The implementation is available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF.The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities in generating coherent, contextually relevant, and human-like text. However, aligning these models with human preferences remains critical challenge, as models can generate outputs that are misaligned with user intent or ethical guidelines. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as leading methodology to address this challenge by incorporating human preferences into the training process. The field has witnessed significant algorithmic innovations, from the foundational Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [5] to more recent approaches including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [4], REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO) [7], ReMax [2], and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [6]. PPO, while effective, requires critic network that introduces additional computational overhead. Meanwhile, newer methods, like GRPO, address specific aspects of the optimization challenge but may introduce complexities and instability. In this paper, we introduce REINFORCE++, novel variant of the classical REINFORCE algorithm that integrates key optimization techniques from PPO while eliminating the need for critic network. Our approach is designed with three primary goals: Simplicity: By building on the straightforward REINFORCE framework, REINFORCE++ minimizes implementation complexity. Training Stability: The integration of token-level KL penalties, PPO-clip loss and normalized advantage updates ensures robust training dynamics. Efficiency: The removal of the critic network reduces computational overhead, making REINFORCE++ well-suited for large-scale applications. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that REINFORCE++ achieves competitive alignment performance with significantly reduced computational requirements compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions include: novel integration of PPO-inspired techniques into the REINFORCE framework. preprint comprehensive evaluation of REINFORCE++ on general and domain-specific datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in aligning LLMs with human preferences. An open-source implementation to facilitate further research and application.2.1 Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is framework that leverages human-provided feedback to train models capable of generating outputs aligned with human preferences. The process typically involves the following components: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): The model is initially fine-tuned on dataset of human-labeled prompts and responses to establish baseline policy. Reward Modeling: reward model is trained to predict human preferences based on dataset of ranked model outputs. Policy Optimization: Using reinforcement learning, the model policy is optimized to maximize the rewards predicted by the reward model. While RLHF has proven effective in improving model alignment, it also introduces unique challenges. Notably, the optimization process is sensitive to the interplay between the policy and reward models, which can lead to instability and inefficiency. 2.2 The REINFORCE Algorithm REINFORCE is foundational policy gradient method in reinforcement learning that directly optimizes the expected return of policy through gradient ascent. The algorithm operates as follows: Trajectory Sampling: The agent interacts with the environment to generate trajectories consisting of states, actions, and rewards. Return Calculation: The discounted cumulative rewards for each trajectory are computed as: where γ is the discount factor. Policy Gradient Estimation: The gradient of the expected return with respect to the policy parameters is Gt = (cid:88) k=t+1 γktrk, (1) estimated using: θJ(θ) = Eπ [Gtθ log πθ(AtSt)] . Policy Update: The policy parameters are updated via gradient ascent: θ θ + αθJ(θ), where α is the learning rate. (2) (3) Despite its simplicity, REINFORCE suffers from high variance in gradient estimates, which can hinder its scalability to complex tasks such as aligning LLMs. 2.3 Challenges in RLHF RLHF implementations often encounter the following challenges: Computational Overhead: Methods like PPO require critic network, increasing memory and computational demands. Training Instability: The interdependence between the policy and value networks in PPO can lead to convergence issues, particularly for large and complex models [3]. Scalability: Many advanced methods introduce additional hyperparameters and architectural components, complicating their deployment at scale. REINFORCE++, by design, addresses these challenges through its simplicity and efficiency, making it compelling alternative for RLHF tasks. 2 preprint"
