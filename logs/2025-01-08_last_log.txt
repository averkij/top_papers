Prior RLHF works typically take bandit formulation, which, though intuitive, ignores the sequential nature of LM generation and can suffer from the sparse reward issue. While recent works propose dense token-level RLHF, treating each token as an action may be oversubtle to proper reward assignment. In this paper, we seek to get the best of both by training and utilizing segment-level reward model, which assigns reward to each semantically complete text segment that spans over short sequence of tokens. For reward learning, our method allows dynamic text segmentation and compatibility with standard sequence-preference datasets. For effective RL-based LM training against segment reward, we generalize the classical scalar bandit reward normalizers into location-aware normalizer functions and interpolate the segment reward for further densification. With these designs, our method performs competitively on three popular RLHF benchmarks for LM policy: AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench. Ablation studies are conducted to further demonstrate our method. To align language models (LMs, e.g., OpenAI, 2023; Reid et al., 2024) with human values, reinforcement learning (RL, Sutton and Barto, 2018) methods have been widely adopted to optimize the non-differentiable human preference, leading to the paradigm of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022b). prevailing approach in RLHF is to optimize the LMs by proximal policy optimization (PPO, S"
