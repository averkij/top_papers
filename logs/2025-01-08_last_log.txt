It needs digital twin of itself, the policy model, and digital twin of the world, the world model. In this paper, we present the Cosmos World Foundation Model Platform to help developers build customized world models for their Physical AI setups. We position world foundation model as general-purpose world model that can be fine-tuned into customized world models for downstream applications. Our platform covers video curation pipeline, pre-trained world foundation models, examples of post-training of pre-trained world foundation models, and video tokenizers. To help Physical AI builders solve the most critical problems of our society, we make our platform open-source and our models open-weight with permissive licenses available via NVIDIA Cosmos. 1. Introduction Physical AI is an AI system equipped with sensors and actuators: the sensors allow it to observe the world, and the actuators allow it to interact with and modify the world. It holds the promise of freeing human workers from physical tasks that are dangerous, laborious, or tedious. While several fields of AI have advanced significantly thanks to data and compute scaling in the recent decade, Physical AI only inches forward. This is largely because scaling training data for Physical AI is much more challenging, as the desired data must contain sequences of interleaved observations and actions. These actions perturb the physical world and may cause severe damage to the system and the world. This is especially true when the AI is still in its infancy when exploratory actions are essential. World Foundation Model (WFM), digital twin of the physical world that Physical AI can safely interact with, has been long-sought remedy to the data scaling problem. In this paper, we introduce the Cosmos World Foundation Model (WFM) Platform for building Physical AI. We are mainly concerned with the visual world foundation model, where the observations are presented as videos, and the perturbations can exist in various forms. As illustrated in Fig. 2, we present pre-trainingand-then-post-training paradigm, where we divide WFMs into pre-trained and post-trained WFMs. To build pre-trained WFM, we leverage large-scale video training dataset to expose the model to diverse set of visual experiences so it can become generalist. To build post-trained WFM, we fine-tune the pre-trained WFM to arrive at specialized WFM using dataset collected from particular Physical AI environment for the targeted, specialized Physical AI setup. Fig. 1 shows example results from our pre-trained and post-trained WFMs. Data determines the ceiling of an AI model. To build high-ceiling pre-trained WFM, we develop video data curation pipeline. We use it to locate portions of videos with rich dynamics and high visual quality that facilitate learning of physics encoded in visual content. We use the pipeline to extract about 100M clips of videos ranging from 2 to 60 seconds from 20M hour-long video collection. For each clip, we use visual language model (VLM) to provide video caption per 256 frames. Video processing is computationally intensive. We leverage hardware implementations of the H.264 video encoder and decoder available in modern GPUs for decoding and transcoding. Our video data curation pipeline leverages many pre-trained image/video understanding models. These models have different throughputs. To maximize the overall throughput for generating trainable video data, we build Ray-based orchestration pipeline (Moritz et al., 2017). The details are described in Sec. 3. We explore two scalable approaches for building pre-trained WFMs discussed in Sec. 5. These approaches are 1A detailed list of contributors and acknowledgments can be found in App. of this paper. 2025 NVIDIA. All rights reserved. Cosmos World Foundation Model Platform for Physical AI Pre-training: Diffusion WFM Pre-training: Autoregressive WFM Post-training: Camera Control Post-training: Robotic Manipulation Post-training: Autonomous Driving Figure 1: Cosmos World Foundation Models. Pre-trained Cosmos WFMs generate high-quality 3D consistent videos with accurate physics. The Cosmos suite of models includes both diffusion and autoregressive transformer models, which are trained using continuous and discrete latent representations of videos, respectively. Posttraining these WFMs with specialized datasets enables them to be utilized in wide range of Physical AI setups. Specifically, we present models with camera controllability, models capable of instruction-following for robotic manipulation, and models for autonomous driving scenarios. To check full videos and more video examples, please visit our website. 2 Cosmos World Foundation Model Platform for Physical AI Figure 2: Pre-trained WFMs are world model generalists that are trained with large-scale, diverse video datasets capturing different aspects of real-world physics. These pre-trained world foundation models can be specialized to target Physical AI setup through post-training. Usually, the datasets for post-training are prompt-video pairs collected from the target Physical AI setup. The prompt can be in the form of action commands, trajectory, instructions, etc. As the pre-trained WFM provides great foundation, the dataset for post-training can be much smaller. This pre-training-and-post-training yields an efficient strategy for building Physical AI system. In the figure, the dashed lines represent the data loop. transformer-based diffusion models and transformer-based autoregressive models. diffusion model generates videos by gradually removing noise from Gaussian noise video. An autoregressive model generates videos piece by piece, conditioned on the past generations following preset order. Both approaches decompose difficult video generation problem into easier sub-problems, making it more tractable. We leverage state-ofthe-art transformer architectures for their scalability. In Sec. 5.1, we present transformer-based diffusion model design that exhibits strong world-generation capabilities. In Sec. 5.2, we present transformer-based autoregressive model design for world generation. Both the transformer-based diffusion model and transformer-based autoregressive model use tokens as representations of videos, where the former uses continuous tokens in the form of vectors, and the latter uses discrete tokens in the form of integers.

"Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or images. However, precise control over the video generation process, such as camera manipulation or content editing, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods for controlled video generation are typically limited to a single control type, lacking the flexibility to handle diverse control demands. In this paper, we introduce Diffusion as Shader (DaS), a novel approach that supports multiple video control tasks within a unified architecture. Our key insight is that achieving versatile video control necessitates leveraging 3D control signals, as videos are fundamentally 2D renderings of dynamic 3D content. Unlike prior methods limited to 2D control signals, DaS leverages 3D tracking videos as control inputs, making the video diffusion process inherently 3D-aware. This innovation allows DaS to achieve a wide range of video controls by simply manipulating the 3D tracking videos. A further advantage of using 3D tracking videos is their ability to effectively link frames, significantly enhancing the temporal consistency of the generated videos. With just 3 days of fine-tuning on 8 H800 GPUs using less than 10k videos, DaS demonstrates strong control capabilities across diverse tasks, including mesh-to-video generation, camera control, motion transfer, and object manipulation."
