The challenge of this problem arises from the lack of intuitive and interpretable depiction to represent facial expressions that can support customized expressions, and previous work usually addresses this with latent space of expressions, where the codes are learned from large expression dataset or the off-the-shelf ones like 3DMM parameters [1][4]. These methods ignore the fact that the semantic meanings of these codes are implicit, which poses challenges for interpretable, arbitrary and flexible manupulation of expression by non-professionals. In this work, we show that its possible to convincingly alter persons expression, in user-friendly manner by offering localized control with adjustable intensity, while preserving their identity and other attributes from the portrait. Our key insight is to employ action units (AUs) to represent facial expressions, and then steer M. Wei, T. Varanka, H. Khor and G.

In editing facial expressions, the crucial question is which representation should be used to encode expressions. Facial AUs, as anatomical markers of facial muscle activity, have proven effective for precise and flexible facial expression description in images [5][7]. However, most AU annotations are of frontal faces of limited number of subjects in laboratory settings, which is easy to cause overfitting when used for training. model trained by this type of data is hard to generalize on individuals with different poses and backgrounds, which we will present in Section IV-C. To deal with this issue, off-the-shelf AU intensity estimators like Libreface [8] used knowledge distillation technique from large-scale network pre-trained on natural images to accommodate AU intensity estimation task on the lab datasets. Such automatic tools provide us with AU intensity estimation of high accuracy, hence we can produce AU estimation of any face image and use the estimation as AU condition to train our model. On the other hand, diffusion models have emerged as popular choice for image generation, surpassing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with higher generation quality [9][12]. ControlNet-style models enable users to add additional control signals such as depth, paintings, skeleton pose as the condition of the target [13]. Some works modify it to enable some basic expressions like happiness and sad [13], [14], but many of their editing results are with extreme face deformations that may look unrealistic. More importantly, these models can not provide specific controls over expressions, whether through text or through images. Such specific controls, including intensity and location of expressions, are the focus of our work. To merge the advantages of both worlds, we propose MagicFace, model that allows to correlate AU changes to facial expressions and then produce photorealistic edited image conditioned on AU variations. Specifically, MagicFace first extracts AU intensities from portrait photographs using an off-the-shelf method, perform desired AU changes, and finally uses Stable-Diffusion model to map the AU variations into photorealistic images. As the edited images should preserve the background and pose, we first cut out the background of the portrait and draw the contour of the pose, which is learned by an Attribute Controller so that MagicFace only needs to perform conditional inpainting to the face. To maintain the consistency of identity and high-frequency facial characteristics, we introduce an ID encoder which is symmetrical UNet structure to capture spatial details of the input indentity. This design allows the model to understand the relationship with the identity image within uniform feature space, greatly JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 2 Fig. 1. MagicFace takes in the AU changes based on the input portrait and edit the portrait to exhibit different expressions.

The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has sparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs. LMM frameworks typically encode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and integrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language models (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens (predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead. Previous efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM backbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token quantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal vision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while preserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision tokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early layers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text tokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to fuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the extreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token. LLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the understanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient manner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token instead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by 77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over 10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory.

We address the problem of facial expression editing by controling the relative variation of facial action-unit (AU) from the same person. This enables us to edit this specific person's expression in a fine-grained, continuous and interpretable manner, while preserving their identity, pose, background and detailed facial attributes. Key to our model, which we dub MagicFace, is a diffusion model conditioned on AU variations and an ID encoder to preserve facial details of high consistency. Specifically, to preserve the facial details with the input identity, we leverage the power of pretrained Stable-Diffusion models and design an ID encoder to merge appearance features through self-attention. To keep background and pose consistency, we introduce an efficient Attribute Controller by explicitly informing the model of current background and pose of the target. By injecting AU variations into a denoising UNet, our model can animate arbitrary identities with various AU combinations, yielding superior results in high-fidelity expression editing compared to other facial expression editing works.

"We address the problem of facial expression editing by controling the relative variation of facial action-unit (AU) from the same person. This enables us to edit this specific person's expression in a fine-grained, continuous and interpretable manner, while preserving their identity, pose, background and detailed facial attributes. Key to our model, which we dub MagicFace, is a diffusion model conditioned on AU variations and an ID encoder to preserve facial details of high consistency. Specifically, to preserve the facial details with the input identity, we leverage the power of pretrained Stable-Diffusion models and design an ID encoder to merge appearance features through self-attention. To keep background and pose consistency, we introduce an efficient Attribute Controller by explicitly informing the model of current background and pose of the target. By injecting AU variations into a denoising UNet, our model can animate arbitrary identities with various AU combinations, yielding superior results in high-fidelity expression editing compared to other facial expression editing works. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/weimengting/MagicFace."

We present Magic Mirror, a framework for generating identity-preserved videos with cinematic-level quality and dynamic motion. While recent advances in video diffusion models have shown impressive capabilities in text-to-video generation, maintaining consistent identity while producing natural motion remains challenging. Previous methods either require person-specific fine-tuning or struggle to balance identity preservation with motion diversity. Built upon Video Diffusion Transformers, our method introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch facial feature extractor that captures both identity and structural features, (2) a lightweight cross-modal adapter with Conditioned Adaptive Normalization for efficient identity integration, and (3) a two-stage training strategy combining synthetic identity pairs with video data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magic Mirror effectively balances identity consistency with natural motion, outperforming existing methods across multiple metrics while requiring minimal parameters added. The code and model will be made publicly available at: https://github.com/dvlab-research/MagicMirror/
