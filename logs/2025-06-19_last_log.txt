GMT can perform wide range of motion skills with good stability and generalizability, including (a) stretching, (b) kicking-ball, (c) dancing, (d) high kicking, (e) kungfu, and (f) other dynamic skills such as boxing, running, side stepping, and squatting. Abstract: The ability to track general whole-body motions in the real world is useful way to build general-purpose humanoid robots. However, achieving this can be challenging due to the temporal and kinematic diversity of the motions, the policys capability, and the difficulty of coordination of the upper and lower bodies. To address these issues, we propose GMT, general and scalable motiontracking framework that trains single unified policy to enable humanoid robots to track diverse motions in the real world. GMT is built upon two core components: an Adaptive Sampling strategy and Motion Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The Adaptive Sampling automatically balances easy and difficult motions during training. The MoE ensures better specialization of different regions of the motion manifold. We show through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world the effectiveness of GMT, achieving state-of-the-art performance across broad spectrum of motions using unified general policy. Videos and additional information can be found at gmt-humanoid.github.io. Keywords: Humanoid, Locomotion, Learning-based Control, Motion Imitation One of the primary goals for humanoid robots is to perform wide range of tasks in everyday environments. Enabling humanoid robots to produce broad repertoire of human-like movements is promising approach towa"
