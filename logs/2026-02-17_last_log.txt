Text:"6 2 0 2 6 1 ] . [ 1 2 9 4 4 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Query as Anchor: Scenario-Adaptive User Representation via Large Language Model Jiahao Yuan1,, Yike Xu1,, Jinyong Wen1, Baokun Wang1,, Ziyi Gao1, Xiaotong Lin1 Yun Liu1, Xing Fu1, Yu Cheng1, Yongchao Liu1, Weiqiang Wang1, Zhongle Xie2 1Ant Group, 2Zhejiang University China Abstract Industrial-scale user representation learning requires balancing robust universality with acute task-sensitivity. However, existing paradigms primarily yield static, task-agnostic embeddings that struggle to reconcile the divergent requirements of downstream scenarios within unified vector spaces. Furthermore, heterogeneous multi-source data introduces inherent noise and modality conflicts, degrading representation. We propose Query-as-Anchor, framework shifting user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, queryaware synthesis. To empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep user understanding, we first construct UserU, an industrialscale pre-training dataset that aligns multi-modal behavioral sequences with user understanding semantics, and our Q-Anchor Embedding architecture integrates hierarchical coarse-to-fine encoders into dual-tower LLMs via joint contrastive-autoregressive optimization for query-aware user representation. To bridge the gap between general pre-training and specialized business logic, we further introduce Cluster-based Soft Prompt Tuning to enforce discriminative latent structures, effectively aligning model attention with scenario-specific modalities. For deployment, anchoring queries at sequence termini enables KV-cache-accelerated inference with negligible incremental latency. Evaluations on 10 Alipay industrial benchmarks show consistent SOTA performance, strong scalability, and efficient deployment. Large-scale online A/B testing in Alipays production system across two real-world scenarios further validates its practical effectiveness. Our code is prepared for public release and will be available at: https://githu"

Text:"AcoustiVision Pro: An Open-Source Interactive Platform for Room Impulse Response Analysis and Acoustic Characterization Mandip Goswami Acoustics Researcher, WA, USA mandipgoswami@gmail.com 6 2 0 2 1 1 ] . e [ 1 9 9 2 2 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aRoom acoustics analysis plays central role in architectural design, audio engineering, speech intelligibility assessment, and hearing research. Despite the availability of standardized metrics such as reverberation time, clarity, and speech transmission index, accessible tools that combine rigorous signal processing with intuitive visualization remain scarce. This paper presents AcoustiVision Pro, an open-source web-based platform for comprehensive room impulse response (RIR) analysis. The system computes twelve distinct acoustic parameters from uploaded or dataset-sourced RIRs, provides interactive 3D visualizations of early reflections, generates frequency-dependent decay characteristics through waterfall plots, and checks compliance against international standards including ANSI S12.60 and ISO 3382. We introduce the accompanying RIRMega and RIRMega Speech datasets hosted on Hugging Face, containing thousands of simulated room impulse responses with full metadata. The platform supports real-time auralization through FFT-based convolution, exports detailed PDF reports suitable for engineering documentation, and provides CSV data export for further analysis. We describe the mathematical foundations underlying each acoustic metric, detail the system architecture, and present preliminary case studies demonstrating the platforms utility across diverse application domains including classroom acoustics, healthcare facility design, and recording studio evaluation.The acoustic properties of enclosed spaces fundamentally shape human experience within them. concert halls reverberation determines whether orchestral music sounds rich or muddy. classrooms acoustic characteristics directly influence whether students can understand their teacher. Hospital wards with poor acoustic design contribute to patient stress and staff fatigue. Despite this importance, the tools available for analyzing room acoustics have traditionally been either expensive commercial software packages or command-line scripts requiring significant technical expertise. Room impulse responses (RIRs) encode the complete acoustic behavior of space. When sound source emits an impulsive signal in room, the microphone captures not only the direct sound but also reflections from walls, ceiling, floor, and objects within the space. This captured signal, the RIR, can be analyzed to extract numerous perceptually relevant parameters. These parameters inform decisions ranging from whether acoustic treatment is needed to what type of activities space can support. The present work introduces AcoustiVision Pro, web-based platform that makes professional-grade room acoustics analysis accessible to researchers, architects, audio engineers, and educators without requiring specialized software installation or programming knowledge. The system provides twelve analysis modes covering temporal, spectral, and spatial acoustic characteristics. Users can upload their own RIR recordings or draw from the accompanying RIRMega collection of simulated impulse responses. The contributions of this paper are as follows: 1. An open-source interactive platform implementing standardized acoustic metrics with mathematical rigor and perceptual relevance. 2. Integration with the RIRMega and RIRMega Speech datasets, providing thousands of room impulse responses with complete metadata for benchmarking and educational purposes. 3. Novel visualization approaches including ani1 mated 3D reflection mapping, waterfall decay plots, and room mode density analysis. 4. Automated compliance checking against ten international and industry standards for various room types. 5. wellness scoring system that synthesizes multiple acoustic parameters into actionable recommendations for space utilization. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 surveys existing tools and research in room acoustics analysis. Section 3 presents the mathematical foundations for each acoustic metric Section 4 describes implemented in the system. the RIRMega collection. Section 5 details the system architecture and implementation. Section 6 discusses the user interface design principles. Section 7 presents case studies and preliminary evaluation results. Section 8 discusses limitations and future directions. Section 9 concludes with discussion of limitations and future directions.dards The measurement and characterization of room acoustics has been standardized through several international documents. ISO 3382-1 [1] specifies methods for measuring reverberation time and other acoustic parameters in performance spaces. ISO 3382-2 [2] extends these methods to ordinary rooms, while ISO 3382-3 [3] addresses open-plan offices. ANSI S12.60 [4] establishes acoustic performance criteria for classrooms, specifying maximum reverberation times and background noise levels. IEC 6026816 [5] defines the Speech Transmission Index (STI), measure of speech intelligibility that accounts for both reverberation and noise. These standards provide the theoretical basis for the metrics implemented in AcoustiVision Pro. However, the standards documents themselves do not provide software tools, leaving practitioners to implement the calculations themselves or purchase commercial solutions."

We treat El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), canonical example of lowdimensional climate chaos, as test case for culturally-situated sonification evaluated through complex systems diagnostics. Using parameter-mapping sonification of the Nino 3.4 sea surface temperature anomaly index (18702024), we encode ENSO variability into two traditional Javanese gamelan pentatonic systems (pelog and slendro) across four composition strategies, then analyze the resulting audio as trajectories in two-dimensional acoustic phase space. Recurrence-based diagnostics, convex hull geometry, and coupling analysis reveal that the sonification pipeline preserves key dynamical signatures: alternating modes produce the highest trajectory recurrence rates, echoing ENSOs quasi-periodicity; layered polyphonic modes explore the broadest phase space regions; and the two scale families induce qualitatively distinct coupling regimes between spectral brightness and energypredominantly anti-phase in pelog but near-independent in slendro.

A novel framework called Query-as-Anchor is introduced that transforms user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, query-aware synthesis using large language models with specialized architectures and training methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Industrial-scale user representation learning requires balancing robust universality with acute task-sensitivity. However, existing paradigms primarily yield static, task-agnostic embeddings that struggle to reconcile the divergent requirements of downstream scenarios within unified vector spaces. Furthermore, heterogeneous multi-source data introduces inherent noise and modality conflicts, degrading representation. We propose Query-as-Anchor, a framework shifting user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, query-aware synthesis. To empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep user understanding, we first construct UserU, an industrial-scale pre-training dataset that aligns multi-modal behavioral sequences with user understanding semantics, and our Q-Anchor Embedding architecture integrates hierarchical coarse-to-fine encoders into dual-tower LLMs via joint contrastive-autoregressive optimization for query-aware user representation. To bridge the gap between general pre-training and specialized business logic, we further introduce Cluster-based Soft Prompt Tuning to enforce discriminative latent structures, effectively aligning model attention with scenario-specific modalities. For deployment, anchoring queries at sequence termini enables KV-cache-accelerated inference with negligible incremental latency. Evaluations on 10 Alipay industrial benchmarks show consistent SOTA performance, strong scalability, and efficient deployment. Large-scale online A/B testing in Alipay's production system across two real-world scenarios further validates its practical effectiveness. Our code is prepared for public release and will be available at: https://github.com/JhCircle/Q-Anchor.

Room acoustics analysis plays a central role in architectural design, audio engineering, speech intelligibility assessment, and hearing research. Despite the availability of standardized metrics such as reverberation time, clarity, and speech transmission index, accessible tools that combine rigorous signal processing with intuitive visualization remain scarce. This paper presents AcoustiVision Pro, an open-source web-based platform for comprehensive room impulse response (RIR) analysis. The system computes twelve distinct acoustic parameters from uploaded or dataset-sourced RIRs, provides interactive 3D visualizations of early reflections, generates frequency-dependent decay characteristics through waterfall plots, and checks compliance against international standards including ANSI S12.60 and ISO 3382. We introduce the accompanying RIRMega and RIRMega Speech datasets hosted on Hugging Face, containing thousands of simulated room impulse responses with full metadata. The platform supports real-time auralization through FFT-based convolution, exports detailed PDF reports suitable for engineering documentation, and provides CSV data export for further analysis. We describe the mathematical foundations underlying each acoustic metric, detail the system architecture, and present preliminary case studies demonstrating the platform's utility across diverse application domains including classroom acoustics, healthcare facility design, and recording studio evaluation.

Parameter-mapping sonification of ENSO data preserves dynamical signatures through acoustic phase space analysis, revealing distinct coupling regimes in traditional musical scales.  					AI-generated summary 				 Sonification -- the mapping of data to non-speech audio -- offers an underexplored channel for representing complex dynamical systems. We treat El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a canonical example of low-dimensional climate chaos, as a test case for culturally-situated sonification evaluated through complex systems diagnostics. Using parameter-mapping sonification of the Niño 3.4 sea surface temperature anomaly index (1870--2024), we encode ENSO variability into two traditional Javanese gamelan pentatonic systems (pelog and slendro) across four composition strategies, then analyze the resulting audio as trajectories in a two-dimensional acoustic phase space. Recurrence-based diagnostics, convex hull geometry, and coupling analysis reveal that the sonification pipeline preserves key dynamical signatures: alternating modes produce the highest trajectory recurrence rates, echoing ENSO's quasi-periodicity; layered polyphonic modes explore the broadest phase space regions; and the two scale families induce qualitatively distinct coupling regimes between spectral brightness and energy -- predominantly anti-phase in pelog but near-independent in slendro. Phase space trajectory analysis provides a rigorous geometric framework for comparing sonification designs within a complex systems context. Perceptual validation remains necessary; we contribute the dynamical systems methodology for evaluating such mappings.

"Parameter-mapping sonification of ENSO data preserves dynamical signatures through acoustic phase space analysis, revealing distinct coupling regimes in traditional musical scales.  					AI-generated summary 				 Sonification -- the mapping of data to non-speech audio -- offers an underexplored channel for representing complex dynamical systems. We treat El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a canonical example of low-dimensional climate chaos, as a test case for culturally-situated sonification evaluated through complex systems diagnostics. Using parameter-mapping sonification of the Niño 3.4 sea surface temperature anomaly index (1870--2024), we encode ENSO variability into two traditional Javanese gamelan pentatonic systems (pelog and slendro) across four composition strategies, then analyze the resulting audio as trajectories in a two-dimensional acoustic phase space. Recurrence-based diagnostics, convex hull geometry, and coupling analysis reveal that the sonification pipeline preserves key dynamical signatures: alternating modes produce the highest trajectory recurrence rates, echoing ENSO's quasi-periodicity; layered polyphonic modes explore the broadest phase space regions; and the two scale families induce qualitatively distinct coupling regimes between spectral brightness and energy -- predominantly anti-phase in pelog but near-independent in slendro. Phase space trajectory analysis provides a rigorous geometric framework for comparing sonification designs within a complex systems context. Perceptual validation remains necessary; we contribute the dynamical systems methodology for evaluating such mappings."
