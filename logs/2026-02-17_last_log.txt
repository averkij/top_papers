Text:"VisPhyWorld: Probing Physical Reasoning via Code-Driven Video Reconstruction Jiarong Liang * 1 Max Ku * 1 Ka-Hei Hui 2 Ping Nie 3 Wenhu Chen 1 1University of Waterloo 2Autodesk AI Lab 3Independent https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/VisPhyWorld/ Abstract Evaluating whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) genuinely reason about physical dynamics remains challenging. Most existing benchmarks rely on recognition-style protocols such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Violation of Expectation (VoE), which can often be answered without committing to an explicit, testable physical hypothesis. We propose VisPhyWorld, an execution-based framework that evaluates physical reasoning by requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visual observations. By producing runnable code, the inferred world representation is directly inspectable, editable, and falsifiable. This separates physical reasoning from rendering. Building on this framework, we introduce VisPhyBench, comprising 209 evaluation scenes derived from 108 physical templates and systematic protocol that evaluates how well models reconstruct appearance and reproduce physically plausible motion. Our pipeline produces valid reconstructed videos in 97.7% on the benchmark. Experiments show that while state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve strong semantic scene understanding, they struggle to accurately infer physical parameters and to simulate consistent physical dynamics. 6 2 0 2 9 ] .

VisPhyWorld framework evaluates physical reasoning in MLLMs by requiring executable simulator code generation from visual observations, separating physical reasoning from rendering and enabling inspectable, falsifiable world representations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Evaluating whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) genuinely reason about physical dynamics remains challenging. Most existing benchmarks rely on recognition-style protocols such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Violation of Expectation (VoE), which can often be answered without committing to an explicit, testable physical hypothesis. We propose VisPhyWorld, an execution-based framework that evaluates physical reasoning by requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visual observations. By producing runnable code, the inferred world representation is directly inspectable, editable, and falsifiable. This separates physical reasoning from rendering. Building on this framework, we introduce VisPhyBench, comprising 209 evaluation scenes derived from 108 physical templates and a systematic protocol that evaluates how well models reconstruct appearance and reproduce physically plausible motion. Our pipeline produces valid reconstructed videos in 97.7% on the benchmark. Experiments show that while state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve strong semantic scene understanding, they struggle to accurately infer physical parameters and to simulate consistent physical dynamics.

В отличие от традиционных бенчмарков на основе VQA и нарушения ожиданий, подход позволяет отделить физическое рассуждение от рендеринга, получая проверяемые и редактируемые представления окружающего мира. На основе фреймворка создан VisPhyBench с 209 сценами оценки, которые проверяют способность моделей реконструировать внешний вид и воспроизводить физически корректную динамику. Эксперименты показали, что хотя современные MLLM хорошо понимают семантику сцены, они плохо справляются с выводом физических параметров и моделированием согласованной физической динамики.",

"VisPhyWorld framework evaluates physical reasoning in MLLMs by requiring executable simulator code generation from visual observations, separating physical reasoning from rendering and enabling inspectable, falsifiable world representations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Evaluating whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) genuinely reason about physical dynamics remains challenging. Most existing benchmarks rely on recognition-style protocols such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Violation of Expectation (VoE), which can often be answered without committing to an explicit, testable physical hypothesis. We propose VisPhyWorld, an execution-based framework that evaluates physical reasoning by requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visual observations. By producing runnable code, the inferred world representation is directly inspectable, editable, and falsifiable. This separates physical reasoning from rendering. Building on this framework, we introduce VisPhyBench, comprising 209 evaluation scenes derived from 108 physical templates and a systematic protocol that evaluates how well models reconstruct appearance and reproduce physically plausible motion. Our pipeline produces valid reconstructed videos in 97.7% on the benchmark. Experiments show that while state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve strong semantic scene understanding, they struggle to accurately infer physical parameters and to simulate consistent physical dynamics."
