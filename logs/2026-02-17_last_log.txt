This paradigm overlooks the rich dependencies inherent in realistic visual streams, where information is distributed across temporal sequences rather than confined to single snapshots. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepImageSearch, novel agentic paradigm that reformulates image retrieval as an autonomous exploration task. Models must plan and perform multi-step reasoning over raw visual histories to locate targets based on implicit contextual cues. We construct DISBench, challenging benchmark built on interconnected visual data. To address the scalability challenge of creating context-dependent queries, we propose human-model collaborative pipeline that employs vision-language models to mine latent spatiotemporal associations, effectively offloading intensive context discovery before human verification. Furthermore, we build robust baseline using modular agent framework equipped with fine-grained tools and dual-memory system for long-horizon navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DISBench poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art models, highlighting the necessity of incorporating agentic reasoning into next-generation retrieval systems. 6 2 0 2 1 1 ] .

Introduction Image retrieval serves as fundamental mechanism for information access, allowing users to efficiently locate visual content within large repositories ranging from web-scale databases to personal photo albums (Radford et al., 2021; Jia *Equal contribution 1Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China 2OPPO Research Institute. Correspondence to: Chenlong Deng <dengchenlong@ruc.edu.cn>, Zhicheng Dou <dou@ruc.edu.cn>. Preprint. February 12, 2026. Figure 1. Evolution of image retrieval paradigms. (a) Direct retrieval matches queries to images through visual semantic alignment. (b) Reasoning-intensive retrieval requires inference over external knowledge, but still evaluates each image independently. (c) DeepImageSearch demands corpus context awareness, where models must first locate target events within the visual history and then identify qualifying images through multi-step reasoning. et al., 2021). With the development of vision-language models, this field has witnessed great progress, where models demonstrate stronger and stronger capabilities in aligning items in various modals (Jiang et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025). The dominant paradigm underlying these models relies on independent instance matching. It measures the semantic relevance between the query and each candidate DeepImageSearch: Benchmarking Multimodal Agents for Context-Aware Image Retrieval in Visual Histories image in isolation, without considering other images. By computing similarity scores for every image individually, models retrieve the candidates that best correspond to the user input. This simple yet effective approach establishes the backbone for modern visual search applications. However, this paradigm faces significant challenges when handling complex user intents that cannot be fully captured by single visual embedding. Recent reasoningintensive (Cui et al., 2025) or agentic approaches (Cheng et al., 2025a; Tu et al., 2025) address this limitation by employing language models to decompose queries or incorporate external knowledge to refine the search target before matching (as shown in Figure 1 (b), where the model infers specific jersey number from players name). While these methods improve semantic understanding, they still operate under the independent matching assumption, i.e., the target image can be identified in isolation once the textual intent is clarified. In reality, user intents often require information inherently distributed across temporal or causal image sequences, requiring reasoning that interleaves textual and visual evidence. For example, as illustrated in Figure 1 (c), user is searching for concert photos where only the lead singer appears on stage. The users collection may contain numerous visually similar concert photos, and the target images themselves lack distinctive features to verify the specific event. However, if the user recalls blue-and-white event logo at the venue, this clue serves as an anchor to first identify the correct event, after which the targets can be located. Crucially, the evidence required to resolve this query (the logo) and the target (the singer) appear in different images. Since the target cannot be distinguished by appearance alone, models must perform corpus-level contextual reasoning: actively exploring and chaining scattered visual evidence within the corpus. Unlike static knowledge retrieval, this dynamic capability remains largely unexplored by existing benchmarks. To address this limitation, we propose DeepImageSearch, novel paradigm that reformulates image retrieval as an agentic exploration task. Different from conventional methods that use static corpus for passive ranking, DeepImageSearch requires models to discover latent logical structures within the data itself through active exploration. Under this paradigm, models must autonomously plan search trajectories, coordinate fine-grained perception tools, and connect scattered clues to build evidence chains. This transforms retrieval from one-shot matching task into multi-step reasoning process, bridging the gap between complex user queries and precise targets. Constructing such benchmarks presents significant scalability challenge: creating context-dependent queries requires annotators to identify subtle cross-event connections within massive collections, causing significant cognitive load for manual processing. To address this, we introduce human-model collaborative pipeline that offloads the laborintensive context discovery to models. Specifically, we employ vision-language models to parse visual histories and construct spatiotemporal memory graph, automatically mining recurrent clues and potential reasoning paths. These candidates are then verified and refined by human annot"

DeepImageSearch presents an agentic approach to image retrieval that addresses limitations of traditional semantic matching by enabling multi-step reasoning over visual histories through a modular agent framework with dual-memory system.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing multimodal retrieval systems excel at semantic matching but implicitly assume that query-image relevance can be measured in isolation. This paradigm overlooks the rich dependencies inherent in realistic visual streams, where information is distributed across temporal sequences rather than confined to single snapshots. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepImageSearch, a novel agentic paradigm that reformulates image retrieval as an autonomous exploration task. Models must plan and perform multi-step reasoning over raw visual histories to locate targets based on implicit contextual cues. We construct DISBench, a challenging benchmark built on interconnected visual data. To address the scalability challenge of creating context-dependent queries, we propose a human-model collaborative pipeline that employs vision-language models to mine latent spatiotemporal associations, effectively offloading intensive context discovery before human verification. Furthermore, we build a robust baseline using a modular agent framework equipped with fine-grained tools and a dual-memory system for long-horizon navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DISBench poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art models, highlighting the necessity of incorporating agentic reasoning into next-generation retrieval systems.

В отличие от существующих систем мультимодального поиска, которые оценивают релевантность запроса и изображения изолированно, предложенный метод использует контекстные связи, распределённые во времени. Авторы создали DISBench — сложный бенчмарк на основе связанных визуальных данных и предложили модульную архитектуру агента с двойной системой памяти для долгосрочной навигации.
