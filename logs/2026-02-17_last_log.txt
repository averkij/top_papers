[ 1 4 7 5 1 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aConfiguring LLM-based agent systems involves choosing workflows, tools, token budgets, and prompts from large combinatorial design space, and is typically handled today by fixed large templates or hand-tuned heuristics. This leads to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute, since the same cumbersome configuration is often applied to both easy and hard input queries. We formulate agent configuration as query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs. These results demonstrate that learning per-query agent configurations is powerful alternative to one size fits all designs. Codebase: Github 1. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from simple single LLM predictors to the backbone of complex multiagent systems capable of iterative planning, tool usage, and multi-step reasoning. In this new paradigm, the performance of an agentic system is governed not only by the underlying LLM but also by the architecture that wraps it: workflows (e.g. voters, verifiers, optimizers), tool availability, information routing, and context management. Current approaches to agentic architecture design largely rely on static heuristics or kitchen sink strategies that flood the context window with extensive history and retrieved evidence. However, this is suboptimal for two reasons. First, *Equal contribution 1School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, Arizona State University, Tempe, United States of America. Correspondence to: Aditya Taparia <ataparia@asu.edu>, Som Sagar <ssagar6@asu.edu>. Figure 1. (a) Shows how our method learns to configure optimal configuration across thousands of possibilities for the given input. (b) Shows improvement by our method over multiple datasets. (These results are for Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct model.) performance degrades in long contexts due to the lost-inthe-middle phenomenon, where models fail to attend to relevant information (Liu et al., 2024; Hong et al., 2025). Second, static systems are inefficient; they fail to adapt their computational footprint to task difficulty. For example, an agentic system designed for multi-hop reasoning might trigger expensive web-search tools and iterative verification loops even for basic arithmetic query. This one-sizefits-all approach leads to wasted compute and unnecessary latency by applying the same heavy resources to trivial and complex inputs. Ideally, an agent system should adapt its configuration to each query at hand. While intuitive, learning such dynamic configurations is difficult because the design space is combinatorial. For instance, consider system that must answer questions of varying difficulty: Should it invoke single-shot Chain-of-Thought? Deploy parallel voters to 1 Learning to Configure Agentic AI Systems cross-check answers? Allocate generous token budget, or conserve compute with minimal response? Even simple 3-agent system with 5 workflow patterns, 3 tools (each independently enabled) for the first two agents, and 3 budget tiers per agent yields 5 82 33 8,600 structural configurations and adding prompt selection quickly pushes this beyond 105 configurations, rendering brute-force search intractable and manual tuning impractical. To address this, we cast agent configuration as query-wise decision-making problem. To tackle the large search space, we formulate this as reinforcement learning (RL) setup, where lightweight controller on top of frozen agent system jointly optimizes workflows and context management while trading off task accuracy against computational cost. Our contributions are as follows: 1. We introduce ARC, hierarchical RL framework where high-level policy selects workflows and tools while low-level policy composes prompt instructions. Importantly, this policy learning operates over lightweight networks, without updating the backbone LLM, making the method computationally feasible. 2. We propose hybrid training pipeline that combines masked RL with SFT on elite trajectories to to stabilize learning under sparse rewards. 3. We demonstrate through extensive experiments across reasoning and tool-use benchmarks that our method achieves significant gains over static, flat RL-policies and configuration optimization baselines (see Figure 1). 2. Related Work We situate our work at the intersection of three research threads: LLM-based agents, prompt and workflow optimization, and hierarchical reinforcement learning. Large Language Agents LLM-based agents extend language models with iterative decision-making, tool use, and multi-step interaction (Yao et al., 2022; Schick et al., 2023). Recent frameworks provide abstractions for tool calling and multi-agent coordination (Chase, 2022; Wu et al., 2024), while evaluation suites stress realistic long-horizon behavior across general agent benchmarks and web-interaction settings (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023). Tool-centric datasets further broaden the space of available actions and APIs (Qin et al., 2023), and agents have been instantiated in software engineering interfaces where actions include editing code and navigating repositories (Yang et al., 2024b). Despite this progress, most systems rely on manually specified or heuristically tuned workflows with fixed sequencing of reasoning, retrieval, and tool calls. In contrast, our work treats agent configuration as learnable decision problem, enabling query-wise adaptive workflow and budget selection under resource constraints. Prompt and Workflow Optimization Early work on adapting LLM behavior focused on the input prompt optimization. Automated frameworks such as OPRO (Yang et al., 2023), DSPy (Khattab et al., 2023), and GEPA (Agrawal et al., 2025) treat the prompt as an optimization variable, iteratively searching for improved instructions. More recently, the optimization target has shifted from static prompts to agentic workflows and context management. Methods like LLMLingua (Jiang et al., 2023) and LongLLMLingua (Jiang et al., 2024) compress input prompts to fit context window"

Learning per-query agent configurations through reinforcement learning improves task accuracy while reducing computational costs compared to fixed templates and hand-tuned heuristics.  					AI-generated summary 				 Configuring LLM-based agent systems involves choosing workflows, tools, token budgets, and prompts from a large combinatorial design space, and is typically handled today by fixed large templates or hand-tuned heuristics. This leads to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute, since the same cumbersome configuration is often applied to both easy and hard input queries. We formulate agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs. These results demonstrate that learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs.
