Text:"Exposing the Systematic Vulnerability of Open-Weight Models to Preﬁll Attacks Lukas Struppek, Adam Gleave, Kellin Pelrine, FAR.AI 6 2 0 2 6 1 ] . [ 1 9 8 6 4 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r As the capabilities of large language models continue to advance, so does their potential for misuse. While closedsource models typically rely on external defenses, openweight models must primarily depend on internal safeguards to mitigate harmful behavior. Prior red-teaming research has largely focused on input-based jailbreaking and parameterlevel manipulations. However, open-weight models also natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins. Despite its potential, this attack vector has received little systematic attention. We present the largest empirical study to date of prefill attacks, evaluating over 20 existing and novel strategies across multiple model families and state-of-the-art open-weight models. Our results show that prefill attacks are consistently effective against all major contemporary openweight models, revealing critical and previously underexplored vulnerability with significant implications for deployment. While certain large reasoning models exhibit some robustness against generic prefilling, they remain vulnerable to tailored, model-specific strategies. Our findings underscore the urgent need for model developers to prioritize defenses against prefill attacks in open-weight LLMs. 1. Introduction Current large language models (LLMs) function as generalpurpose AI systems, supporting wide range of tasks across domains such as coding, planning, and analysis without requiring specialization or retraining. Unlike traditional search engines, which merely direct users to relevant websites, LLMs directly generate task-specific information and actionable solutions in concise form. These capabilities can also be exploited by malicious actors. Whereas, for instance, developing malware once required substantial prog"

Prefill attacks represent a significant and underexplored vulnerability in open-weight language models, affecting major contemporary models despite some resistance from large reasoning models.  					AI-generated summary 				 As the capabilities of large language models continue to advance, so does their potential for misuse. While closed-source models typically rely on external defenses, open-weight models must primarily depend on internal safeguards to mitigate harmful behavior. Prior red-teaming research has largely focused on input-based jailbreaking and parameter-level manipulations. However, open-weight models also natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins. Despite its potential, this attack vector has received little systematic attention. We present the largest empirical study to date of prefill attacks, evaluating over 20 existing and novel strategies across multiple model families and state-of-the-art open-weight models. Our results show that prefill attacks are consistently effective against all major contemporary open-weight models, revealing a critical and previously underexplored vulnerability with significant implications for deployment. While certain large reasoning models exhibit some robustness against generic prefilling, they remain vulnerable to tailored, model-specific strategies. Our findings underscore the urgent need for model developers to prioritize defenses against prefill attacks in open-weight LLMs.

  "desc": "В работе исследуется уязвимость в открытых языковых моделях, связанная с атаками на этап префиллинга — когда злоумышленник предзаполняет начальные токены ответа до того, как модель начнёт генерацию. Авторы провели масштабное эмпирическое исследование более 20 стратегий атак на различные семейства моделей и обнаружили, что такие атаки эффективны против всех основных современных открытых моделей. Хотя некоторые большие модели с расширенным рассуждением показывают устойчивость к универсальным префиллинг-атакам, они остаются уязвимы перед специализированными, адаптированными под конкретную модель стратегиями. Результаты подчёркивают критическую необходимость разработки защит против такого класса атак при развёртывании открытых LLM в production.",
