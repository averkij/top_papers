Text:"InnoEval: On Research Idea Evaluation as Knowledge-Grounded, Multi-Perspective Reasoning Problem Shuofei Qiao 1 2 Yunxiang Wei 1 Xuehai Wang 1 Bin Wu 2 Boyang Xue 3 Ningyu Zhang 1 Hossein A.

[ 1 7 6 3 4 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract The rapid evolution of Large Language Models has catalyzed surge in scientific idea production, yet this leap has not been accompanied by matching advance in idea evaluation. The fundamental nature of scientific evaluation needs knowledgeable grounding, collective deliberation, and multi-criteria decision-making. However, existing idea evaluation methods often suffer from narrow knowledge horizons, flattened evaluation dimensions, and the inherent bias in LLM-as-aJudge. To address these, we regard idea evaluation as knowledge-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning problem and introduce InnoEval, deep innovation evaluation framework designed to emulate human-level idea assessment. We apply heterogeneous deep knowledge search engine that retrieves and grounds dynamic evidence from diverse online sources. We further achieve review consensus with an innovation review board containing reviewers with distinct academic backgrounds, enabling multi-dimensional decoupled evaluation across multiple metrics. We construct comprehensive datasets derived from authoritative peer-reviewed submissions to benchmark InnoEval. Experiments demonstrate that InnoEval can consistently outperform baselines in point-wise, pair-wise, and group-wise evaluation tasks, exhibiting judgment patterns and consensus highly aligned with human experts. 1.

ACM ISBN 978-x-xxxx-xxxx-x/YY/MM. . . $15.00 https://doi.org/10.1145/nnnnnnn.nnnnnnn Yu Zhang Texas A&M UniversityFigure 1: Knowledge extraction attack on RAG causes privacy/proprietary risks across pervasive high-stake domains.Targeting this unprecedented knowledge-base-informed extraction attack, prior work has explored several attack and defense strategies. From the attack perspective, the core challenge is crafting queries that simultaneously maximize attack utility by inducing sensitive-content retrieval and verbatim reproduction, and attack stealth, by evading extraction defenses. Existing methods achieve this via two complementary components [13]. The INFORMATION component steers retrieval toward sensitive content by inducing favorable embedding-space alignment, using random text [24], LLMgenerated fragments [25], or embedding-optimized queries [26], Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Qi, et al. enabling (un)targeted extraction. The COMMAND component instructs the generator to explicitly reproduce retrieved content, typically through prompts requesting verbatim output [13, 24, 26, 27]. Operating jointly within single query, these two components adversarially drive RAG systems to both retrieve sensitive information and leak it through generated content. Beyond single-query attacks [13, 27], adversaries can further exploit the iterative queryresponse loop of RAG systems [2426] to progressively accumulate sensitive content. From the defense perspective, existing approaches aim to mitigate extraction by intervening at different stages of the RAG pipeline. Input defenses [25, 28] reject suspicious requests with malicious extraction intent before retrieval. Retrieval defenses [13, 24 26] constrain retrieval of sensitive content by limiting the quantity or relevance of retrieved documents. Generation defenses [13, 27] operate after retrieval, controlling what content is ultimately revealed to the user through techniques such as summarization or content filtering to prevent verbatim reproduction of sensitive passages. Despite the above progress , existing studies are typically conducted under heterogeneous yet inconsistent experimental settings, as in Table 1. These differences span dataset versions (e.g., HealthCareMagic origin [13, 25] versus (vs.) sampled instances [24, 26]) , retrieval embedding models (e.g., MiniLM [13] vs. MPNet [26] , generators (e.g., Llama [13] vs. Gemini [26]) , knowledge-base construction strategies (e.g., Knowledge instance [13, 25, 26] vs. Fixed chunk length [24]), assumptions about attacker and defender capabilities (e.g., embedding white box [26] vs. black box [13, 24, 25]), and non-uniformed evaluation metrics [2426]. This lack of unified design space and experimental settings makes it difficult to obtain comparable understanding of extraction attack and defense behaviors in RAG systems. To address this fragmentation, we introduce unified benchmark for systematic and fair evaluation that spans comprehensive RAG design space. It covers diverse retriever and generator architectures, knowledge-base construction strategies, and extraction attack querycrafting methods, ranging from simple random baselines to state-of-the-art adaptive attacks [24 26]. The benchmark further incorporates widely adopted defense mechanisms deployed at different stages of the RAG pipeline. All attacks and defenses are evaluated under unified experimental protocol across multiple datasets [21, 2931], ensuring consistent threat assumptions, comparable metrics, and fair assessment of effectiveness. Our contributions are as follows: Comprehensive review and unified design space. We systematically survey existing knowledge-extraction attack and defense methods for RAG systems [13, 2426, 26] in Table 1 and formalize unified design space that characterizes their unique design dimensions and assumptions in 3.

Ahmed4, Puneet Mathur5, Nedim Lipka6, Franck Dernoncourt7, Ryan A. Rossi8 1,2Independent Researchers, 3,5,6,7,8Adobe Research, 4Cisco Research {1jfang53, 2cliu282}@ucsc.edu Abstract Large language model (LLM) judges have often been used alongside traditional, algorithm-based metrics for tasks like summarization because they better capture semantic information, are better at reasoning, and are more robust to paraphrasing. However, LLM judges show biases for length and order among others, and are vulnerable to various adversarial input prompts. While recent studies have looked into these biases, few have analyzed them at more granular level in relation to well-defined overlap metric. In this work we provide an LLM judge bias analysis as function of overlap with human-written responses in the domain of summarization. We test 9 recent LLMs with parameter counts ranging from 1 billion to 12 billion, including variants of Gemma 3 and LLaMA 3. We find that LLM judges increasingly prefer summaries generated by other LLMs over those written by humans as the similarities (as measured by ROUGE and BLEU) between the judged summaries decrease, and this pattern extends to all but one model tested, and exists regardless of the models own position biases. Additionally, we find that models struggle to judge even summaries with limited overlaps, suggesting that LLM-as-a-judge in the summary domain should rely on techniques beyond simple comparison. Keywords: LLMs, summarization As large language models (LLMs) continue to improve in their capabilities, LLM-as-a-judge has emerged as method of automating evaluation. Compared to traditional overlap-based metrics, LLM judges better capture semantic content of texts and are more robust to paraphrasing.

InnoEval is a deep innovation evaluation framework that emulates human-level idea assessment through knowledge-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning with heterogeneous deep knowledge search and multi-dimensional decoupled evaluation.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid evolution of Large Language Models has catalyzed a surge in scientific idea production, yet this leap has not been accompanied by a matching advance in idea evaluation. The fundamental nature of scientific evaluation needs knowledgeable grounding, collective deliberation, and multi-criteria decision-making. However, existing idea evaluation methods often suffer from narrow knowledge horizons, flattened evaluation dimensions, and the inherent bias in LLM-as-a-Judge. To address these, we regard idea evaluation as a knowledge-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning problem and introduce InnoEval, a deep innovation evaluation framework designed to emulate human-level idea assessment. We apply a heterogeneous deep knowledge search engine that retrieves and grounds dynamic evidence from diverse online sources. We further achieve review consensus with an innovation review board containing reviewers with distinct academic backgrounds, enabling a multi-dimensional decoupled evaluation across multiple metrics. We construct comprehensive datasets derived from authoritative peer-reviewed submissions to benchmark InnoEval. Experiments demonstrate that InnoEval can consistently outperform baselines in point-wise, pair-wise, and group-wise evaluation tasks, exhibiting judgment patterns and consensus highly aligned with human experts.

A systematic benchmark for evaluating knowledge-extraction attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems is introduced, covering diverse attack and defense strategies across multiple retrieval and generation models with standardized evaluation protocols.  					AI-generated summary 				 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone of knowledge-intensive applications, including enterprise chatbots, healthcare assistants, and agentic memory management. However, recent studies show that knowledge-extraction attacks can recover sensitive knowledge-base content through maliciously crafted queries, raising serious concerns about intellectual property theft and privacy leakage. While prior work has explored individual attack and defense techniques, the research landscape remains fragmented, spanning heterogeneous retrieval embeddings, diverse generation models, and evaluations based on non-standardized metrics and inconsistent datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first systematic benchmark for knowledge-extraction attacks on RAG systems. Our benchmark covers a broad spectrum of attack and defense strategies, representative retrieval embedding models, and both open- and closed-source generators, all evaluated under a unified experimental framework with standardized protocols across multiple datasets. By consolidating the experimental landscape and enabling reproducible, comparable evaluation, this benchmark provides actionable insights and a practical foundation for developing privacy-preserving RAG systems in the face of emerging knowledge extraction threats. Our code is available here.

"A systematic benchmark for evaluating knowledge-extraction attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems is introduced, covering diverse attack and defense strategies across multiple retrieval and generation models with standardized evaluation protocols.  					AI-generated summary 				 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone of knowledge-intensive applications, including enterprise chatbots, healthcare assistants, and agentic memory management. However, recent studies show that knowledge-extraction attacks can recover sensitive knowledge-base content through maliciously crafted queries, raising serious concerns about intellectual property theft and privacy leakage. While prior work has explored individual attack and defense techniques, the research landscape remains fragmented, spanning heterogeneous retrieval embeddings, diverse generation models, and evaluations based on non-standardized metrics and inconsistent datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first systematic benchmark for knowledge-extraction attacks on RAG systems. Our benchmark covers a broad spectrum of attack and defense strategies, representative retrieval embedding models, and both open- and closed-source generators, all evaluated under a unified experimental framework with standardized protocols across multiple datasets. By consolidating the experimental landscape and enabling reproducible, comparable evaluation, this benchmark provides actionable insights and a practical foundation for developing privacy-preserving RAG systems in the face of emerging knowledge extraction threats. Our code is available here."

LLM judges exhibit bias toward summaries similar to their own generation, with performance deteriorating as summary overlap with human references decreases across multiple model sizes and architectures.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language model (LLM) judges have often been used alongside traditional, algorithm-based metrics for tasks like summarization because they better capture semantic information, are better at reasoning, and are more robust to paraphrasing. However, LLM judges show biases for length and order among others, and are vulnerable to various adversarial input prompts. While recent studies have looked into these biases, few have analyzed them at a more granular level in relation to a well-defined overlap metric. In this work we provide an LLM judge bias analysis as a function of overlap with human-written responses in the domain of summarization. We test 9 recent LLMs with parameter counts ranging from 1 billion to 12 billion, including variants of Gemma 3 and LLaMA 3. We find that LLM judges increasingly prefer summaries generated by other LLMs over those written by humans as the similarities (as measured by ROUGE and BLEU) between the judged summaries decrease, and this pattern extends to all but one model tested, and exists regardless of the models' own position biases. Additionally, we find that models struggle to judge even summaries with limited overlaps, suggesting that LLM-as-a-judge in the summary domain should rely on techniques beyond a simple comparison.

Data Darwinism presents a systematic framework for data-model co-evolution through a ten-level taxonomy, demonstrating that advanced processing techniques significantly improve foundation model performance on scientific text.  					AI-generated summary 				 Data quality determines foundation model performance, yet systematic processing frameworks are lacking. We introduce Data Darwinism, a ten-level taxonomy (L0-L9) that conceptualizes data-model co-evolution: advanced models produce superior data for next-generation systems. We validate this on scientific literature by constructing Darwin-Science, a 900B-token corpus (L0-L5). We identify a learnability gap in raw scientific text, which we bridge via L4 (Generative Refinement) and L5 (Cognitive Completion) using frontier LLMs to explicate reasoning and terminology.   To ensure rigorous attribution, we pre-trained daVinci-origin-3B/7B models from scratch, excluding scientific content to create contamination-free baselines. After 600B tokens of continued pre-training, Darwin-Science outperforms baselines by +2.12 (3B) and +2.95 (7B) points across 20+ benchmarks, rising to +5.60 and +8.40 points on domain-aligned tasks. Systematic progression to L5 yields a +1.36 total gain, confirming that higher-level processing unlocks latent data value. We release the Darwin-Science corpus and daVinci-origin models to enable principled, co-evolutionary development.

Systematic progression to L5 yields a +1.36 total gain, confirming that higher-level processing unlocks latent data value. We release the Darwin-Science corpus and daVinci-origin models to enable principled, co-evolutionary development."
