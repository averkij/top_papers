Text:"Conversational Image Segmentation: Grounding Abstract Concepts with Scalable Supervision6 2 0 2 3 1 ] . [ 1 5 9 1 3 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Figure 1. Conversational Image Segmentation requires reasoning beyond object categories. Left: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) grounds descriptive phrases about object identity and spatial relations (e.g., left-most apple). Right: Conversational Image Segmentation (CIS) grounds abstract, intent-oriented concepts that require relational reasoning, physical understanding, and implicit constraints.1. Introduction Conversational image segmentation grounds abstract, intent-driven concepts into pixel-accurate masks. Prior work on referring image grounding focuses on categorical and spatial queries (e.g., left-most apple) and overlooks functional and physical reasoning (e.g., where can safely store the knife?). We address this gap and introduce Conversational Image Segmentation (CIS) and CONVERSEG, benchmark spanning entities, spatial relations, intent, affordances, functions, safety, and physical reasoning. We also present CONVERSEG-NET, which fuses strong segmentation priors with language understanding, and an AI-powered data engine that generates promptmask pairs without human supervision. We show that current language-guided segmentation models are inadequate for CIS, while CONVERSEGNET trained on our data engine achieves significant gains on CONVERSEG and maintains strong performance on existing language-guided segmentation benchmarks. Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/converseg. Which suitcases can take without disturbing the stack? For humans, the answer is immediate: we identify which pieces are load-bearing versus accessible, anticipate redistribution of weight, and filter candidates by the constraint of easy removal. Yet segmentation model, trained to predict suitcase and cart, lacks any representation of support relations, occlusion ordering, or physical stability. Selecting easily removable luggage requires reasoning jointly over geometry, physics, and user intent not merely recognizing object categories. This type of conversational, intent-driven language instruction reflects how humans naturally interact with their environments, yet remains beyond the reach of current perception systems. In computer vision, grounding images using natural language expressions was first explored through the task of Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) [41]. However, existing benchmarks for this task, RefCOCO variants [41], primarily emphasize categorical and spatial references, such as the white umbrella or the left-most apple, shown on the left of Fig. 1. By contrast, functional or physical reasoning about 1 objects and environments such as what object is prone to rolling if unsecured or where can safely store the knife? is largely underrepresented. We address this gap by introducing Conversational Image Segmentation (CIS), task that grounds high-level conversational concepts into pixel-accurate masks in natural images. Examples are shown in Fig. 1. We call these concepts conversational because they mirror how humans naturally talk about objects and their surroundings. They span five families, inspired by human vision science [9, 27] and intuitive physics [2]: (1) Entities with open-vocabulary descriptions (weathered wooden furniture); (2) Spatial & Layout capturing complex geometric relations (items blocking the walkway); (3) Relations & Events describing interactions (the player about to catch the ball); (4) Affordances & Functions requiring use-case reasoning (surfaces suitable for hot cookware); and (5) Physics & Safety involving stability or hazard assessment (objects likely to tip over). To measure progress in CIS, we introduce the CONVERSEG benchmark, featuring 1,687 human-verified imagemask pairs. Unlike previous benchmarks that focus on categorical entities and simple spatial relations, CONVERSEG offers coverage across all five concept families and broader representation of conversational reasoning. We hope that advancing CIS with CONVERSEG will advance perception systems in assistive robotics, humanrobot interaction and augmented reality domains that require grounding abstract concepts. We further introduce CONVERSEG-NET, conversational segmentation model that maps an image and prompt to grounding mask. Training it demands large-scale supervision over diverse prompts in natural images costly and cognitively intensive effort for human annotators who must produce pixel-accurate masks and natural, reasoningrich prompts. To bypass this bottleneck, we build an automated, VLM-driven data engine that synthesizes high-quality promptmask pairs without human supervision via an iterative generate-and-verify loop, yielding 106K imagemask pairs across all five concept families. Trained on this data, CONVERSEG-NET achieves strong results on CONVERSEG and remains competitive on standard referring expression benchmarks, demonstrating both data quality and scalability. In summary, our contributions are: We introduce Conversational Image Segmentation (CIS) and CONVERSEG, benchmark of human-verified imagemask pairs targeting grounding of affordances, physics, and functional reasoning. We build an AI-powered data engine that synthesizes diverse, high-quality conversational promptmask pairs without human supervision. We design baseline model, CONVERSEG-NET; trained on our engines data, it excels on CONVERSEG and remains strong on RIS benchmarks. 2. Related Work Referring Expression Segmentation. Referring expression segmentation (RIS) localizes regions described by language. RefCOCO/+/g [41] are standard benchmarks but are dominated by object-centric, low-level spatial phrases (e.g., person on the left, red cup). Early methods used multi-stage languagevision pipelines [12, 20]; recent work adopts Transformer-based vision-language encoders [15, 39]. Despite strong results on entities and simple spatial relations, these benchmarks seldom test affordances, stability, or user intent. Our CIS task and CONVERSEG explicitly target these gaps via five conversational concept families. Reasoning and Implicit Segmentation. ReasonSeg [17] pairs images with implicit, reasoning-heavy instructions and masks, but queries still target entities or spatial relations, with limited coverage of affordances, safety, or physical constraints. Multi-modal LLM systems (LISA [17], GLaMM [31], PixelLM [34]) can perform multi-step reasoning and produce masks, yet rely on heavy backbon"

Experiential Reinforcement Learning introduces an explicit experience-reflection-consolidation loop that improves learning efficiency and performance in sparse-reward environments by enabling structured behavioral revision without additional inference costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning has become the central approach for language models (LMs) to learn from environmental reward or feedback. In practice, the environmental feedback is usually sparse and delayed. Learning from such signals is challenging, as LMs must implicitly infer how observed failures should translate into behavioral changes for future iterations. We introduce Experiential Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a training paradigm that embeds an explicit experience-reflection-consolidation loop into the reinforcement learning process. Given a task, the model generates an initial attempt, receives environmental feedback, and produces a reflection that guides a refined second attempt, whose success is reinforced and internalized into the base policy. This process converts feedback into structured behavioral revision, improving exploration and stabilizing optimization while preserving gains at deployment without additional inference cost. Across sparse-reward control environments and agentic reasoning benchmarks, ERL consistently improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong reinforcement learning baselines, achieving gains of up to +81% in complex multi-step environments and up to +11% in tool-using reasoning tasks. These results suggest that integrating explicit self-reflection into policy training provides a practical mechanism for transforming feedback into durable behavioral improvement.

Этот процесс преобразует разреженную обратную связь в структурированное изменение поведения, улучшая исследование пространства действий и стабилизируя оптимизацию политики.

Conversational image segmentation addresses functional and physical reasoning tasks by introducing a new benchmark and model that combines segmentation priors with language understanding.  					AI-generated summary 				 Conversational image segmentation grounds abstract, intent-driven concepts into pixel-accurate masks. Prior work on referring image grounding focuses on categorical and spatial queries (e.g., "left-most apple") and overlooks functional and physical reasoning (e.g., "where can I safely store the knife?"). We address this gap and introduce Conversational Image Segmentation (CIS) and ConverSeg, a benchmark spanning entities, spatial relations, intent, affordances, functions, safety, and physical reasoning. We also present ConverSeg-Net, which fuses strong segmentation priors with language understanding, and an AI-powered data engine that generates prompt-mask pairs without human supervision. We show that current language-guided segmentation models are inadequate for CIS, while ConverSeg-Net trained on our data engine achieves significant gains on ConverSeg and maintains strong performance on existing language-guided segmentation benchmarks.
