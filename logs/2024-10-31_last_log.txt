[31.10.2024 14:12] OpenAI request. Model: gpt-4o-mini. Prompt: Write a text with image prompt in style of surrealism and modern art based on the following paper. Use key themes and elements from it. Add instruction to write a text that reads as brief paper title as a label on some object on an image. Style: linear art on white background. Return only prompt and nothing else. Title: 'A Large Recurrent Action Model: xLSTM enables Fast Inference for Robotics Tasks' Text: 'In recent years, there has been a trend in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) towards large action models trained offline on large-scale datasets via sequence modeling. Existing models are primarily based on the Transformer architecture, which result in powerful agents. However, due to slow inference times, Transformer-based approaches are impractical for real-time applications, such as robotics. Recently, modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have been proposed that exhibit parallelization benefits during training similar to the Transformer architecture while offering fast inference. In this work, we study the aptitude of these modern recurrent architectures for large action models. Consequently, we propose a Large Recurrent Action Model (LRAM) with an xLSTM at its core that comes with linear-time inference complexity and natural sequence length extrapolation abilities. Experiments on 432 tasks from 6 domains show that LRAM compares favorably to Transformers in terms of performance and speed.'

Readers can have different goals with respect to the text they are reading. Can these goals be decoded from the pattern of their eye movements over the text? In this work, we examine for the first time whether it is possible to decode two types of reading goals that are common in daily life: information seeking and ordinary reading. Using large scale eye-tracking data, we apply to this task a wide range of state-of-the-art models for eye movements and text that cover different architectural and data representation strategies, and further introduce a new model ensemble. We systematically evaluate these models at three levels of generalization: new textual item, new participant, and the combination of both. We find that eye movements contain highly valuable signals for this task. We further perform an error analysis which builds on prior empirical findings on differences between ordinary reading and information seeking and leverages rich textual annotations. This analysis reveals key properties of textual items and participant eye movements that contribute to the difficulty of the task.

We present REM, a framework for segmenting a wide range of concepts in video that can be described through natural language. Our method capitalizes on visual-language representations learned by video diffusion models on Internet-scale datasets. A key insight of our approach is preserving as much of the generative model's original representation as possible, while fine-tuning it on narrow-domain Referral Object Segmentation datasets. As a result, our framework can accurately segment and track rare and unseen objects, despite being trained on object masks from a limited set of categories. Additionally, it can generalize to non-object dynamic concepts, such as waves crashing in the ocean, as demonstrated in our newly introduced benchmark for Referral Video Process Segmentation (Ref-VPS). Our experiments show that REM performs on par with state-of-the-art approaches on in-domain datasets, like Ref-DAVIS, while outperforming them by up to twelve points in terms of region similarity on out-of-domain data, leveraging the power of Internet-scale pre-training.

"We present REM, a framework for segmenting a wide range of concepts in video that can be described through natural language. Our method capitalizes on visual-language representations learned by video diffusion models on Internet-scale datasets. A key insight of our approach is preserving as much of the generative model's original representation as possible, while fine-tuning it on narrow-domain Referral Object Segmentation datasets. As a result, our framework can accurately segment and track rare and unseen objects, despite being trained on object masks from a limited set of categories. Additionally, it can generalize to non-object dynamic concepts, such as waves crashing in the ocean, as demonstrated in our newly introduced benchmark for Referral Video Process Segmentation (Ref-VPS). Our experiments show that REM performs on par with state-of-the-art approaches on in-domain datasets, like Ref-DAVIS, while outperforming them by up to twelve points in terms of region similarity on out-of-domain data, leveraging the power of Internet-scale pre-training."
