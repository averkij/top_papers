Text:"6 2 0 2 0 1 ] . [ 1 9 9 0 0 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Learning on the Manifold: Unlocking Standard Diffusion Transformers with Representation Encoders Amandeep Kumar 1 Vishal M. PatelLeveraging representation encoders for generative modeling offers path for efficient, highfidelity synthesis. However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to capacity bottleneckproposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformerswe demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge. Code: https://github.com/amandpkr/RJF Figure 1. Bridging the Geometric Gap. We demonstrate that respecting the intrinsic geometry of pre-trained representations encoders enables the use of standard Diffusion Transformers without any architectural modification such as Width Scaling (Zheng et al., 2025). Our method, Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (+DiNO+RJF), achieves an FID of 4.95 using standard LightingDiT-B (Yao et al., 2025) architecture without guidance, significantly outperforming the VAE-based LightingDiT-B (FID 15.83). In contrast, applying standard Flow Matching to DINOv2B features (+DiNO) fails to converge (FID 21.64) due to Geometric Interference. Even restricting the noise to the hypersphere to strictly learn the angular component (+DiNO+SN) yields only marginal improvement (FID 19.07), as the Euclidean linear paths still traverse the low-probability interior of the feature manifold. 1. Introduction Flow Matching (Lipman et al., 2022; Esser et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2022; Albergo & Vanden-Eijnden, 2022) and Diffusion models (Ma et al., 2024; Rombach et al., 2022; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020) have revolutionized generative modeling, enabling high-fidelity synthesis across modalities. While initial approaches operated in pixel space, the paradigm has shifted toward Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) (Rombach et al., 2022; Vahdat et al., 2021) that leverage compressed representations of VAE (Kingma & Welling, 2013). However, because VAEs are optimized for reconstruction, they predominantly capture low-level 1Johns Hopkins University. texture; this forces the diffusion model to learn high-level semantics from scratch, leading to slow convergence. To overcome this, recent works enhance the VAE latent space with semantic priors from strong representation encoders like DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023) and SigLIP (Radford et al., 2021). These approaches typically require explicitly aligning semantic representations within the VAE latent space (Yao et al., 2025) or the diffusion intermediate features (Leng et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2024). Consequently, these methods often necessitate complex auxiliary losses and additional training stages. Recent work challenges this complexity by proposing Representation Autoencoders (RAE) (Zheng et al., 2025), which discard the VAE entirely in favor of diffusing directly within the feature space of frozen representation encoders. RAEs 1 demonstrate that these high-dimensional semantic representations can support high-fidelity generation without the need for auxiliary alignment losses or complex training stages. However we also have the similar observation like RAE (Zheng et al., 2025) that the standard diffusion recipe fails to converge effectively on these high-dimensional latents, even in simplified single-image overfitting regime. While RAE attributes this failure to capacity bottleneck, proposing to scale the transformer width to match the latent dimensionalitywe identify more fundamental cause rooted in the intrinsic geometry of the latent space. We argue that the optimization difficulty arises not from insufficient parameter count, but from Geometry Gap: structural conflict where the Euclidean probability paths assumed by standard flow matching (Lipman et al., 2022) violate the hyperspherical manifold of representation space. To understand this failure, we analyze the intrinsic geometry of the feature space. We observe that DINOv2 representations do not populate the ambient Euclidean space but are strictly confined to hypersphere, creating hard shell geometry, and all the information are encoded in angular vectors. We identify the root cause of convergence failure for standard diffusion transfomer as Geometric Interference: the standard linear probability path used in flow matching cuts through the low-density interior (off-manifold) of hypersphere (forming chord), rather than following the manifolds surface (Rozen et al., 2021; Mathieu & Nickel, 2020). This forces the model to learn velocity field in regions where the representation space is undefined as shown in Figure 2. Crucially, we challenge the prevailing hypothesis that this requires scaling model width (Zheng et al., 2025). Our experiments reveal that the model has sufficient capacity to learn the semantics, but under the standard objective, it wastes its capacity, minimizing radial error (learning feature magnitude which is fixed as the radius of hypersphere) and learning trajectories through the off-manifold area induced by this geometric mismatch. Motivated from this insight, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). First, we address the trajectory mismatch by adopting Riemannian Flow Matching (Chen & Lipman, 2023), which replaces the Euclidean linear path with Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP). This ensures the generative process follows the geodesic(shortest path along the curve between two points), staying strictly on the manifold surface. Second, we recognize that simply fixing the path is insufficient because the flow matching objective remains geometrically unaware; it treats errors uniformly. On positively curved hypersphere, velocity errors propagate non-lin"

Text:"Learning to Continually Learn via Meta-learning Agentic Memory Designs Yiming Xiong 1 Shengran Hu 1 2 Jeff Clune 1The statelessness of foundation models bottlenecks agentic systems ability to continually learn, core capability for long-horizon reasoning and adaptation. To address this limitation, agentic systems commonly incorporate memory modules to retain and reuse past experience, aiming for continual learning during test time. However, most existing memory designs are human-crafted and fixed, which limits their ability to adapt to the diversity and non-stationarity of real-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems), framework that meta-learns memory designs to replace hand-engineered memory designs, therefore minimizing human effort and enabling agentic systems to be continual learners across diverse domains. Our approach employs Meta Agent that searches over memory designs expressed as executable code in an open-ended manner, theoretically allowing the discovery of arbitrary memory designs, including database schemas as well as their retrieval and update mechanisms. Extensive experiments across four sequential decision-making domains demonstrate that the learned memory designs enable more effective and efficient learning from experience than state-of-the-art human-crafted memory designs on all benchmarks. When developed and deployed safely, ALMA represents step toward self-improving AI systems that learn to be adaptive, continual learners.

Introduction Agentic systems powered by Foundation Models (FMs) have enabled autonomous decision-making and task execution 1University of British Columbia 2Vector Institute 3Canada CIFAR AI Chair. Correspondence to: Yiming Xiong <yiming33@student.ubc.ca>. Preprint. February 10, 2026. 1 across wide range of domains (Yao et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024). However, the stateless nature of FMs during inference challenges agentic systems to accumulate experience and continually learn from past interactions, causing them to repeatedly solve tasks from scratch and limiting their ability to improve over time (Child et al., 2019; Bulatov et al., 2022). Memory addresses this limitation by enabling agentic systems to continually store and reuse past experiences (Zhong et al., 2024; Packer et al., 2024). This allows accumulated experience to inform decision-making in future tasks, aiming for continual learning over time. However, memory design, the architectural specification that determines how memories are represented, stored, retrieved, and updated, is still predominantly handcrafted by humans. Diverse domains require distinct memory designs to leverage unique aspects of experience, resulting in human researchers manually tailoring wide array of designs to specific tasks (Zhang et al., 2024b; Hu et al., 2026). For example, in conversational agents, memory may focus on retaining facts about the user, such as preferences and personal information (Chhikara et al., 2025; Rasmussen et al., 2025). In contrast, for strategic games, memory should extract abstract skills and strategies from previous interactions rather than details that may change across episodes (Tang et al., 2025; Ouyang et al., 2025). Therefore, manually identifying an optimal memory design for each domain is both difficult and labor-intensive. recurring theme in machine learning history is that handcrafted components in AI systems are eventually replaced by learned, more effective ones (Clune, 2020; Hutter et al., 2019; Sutton, 2019). classic example of this paradigm is the transition from hand-designed features to learned representations in computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). More recently, the trend of learning to learn has expanded to learning neural architectures (Zoph & Le, 2017), optimization algorithms (Andrychowicz et al., 2016), training environments (Wang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2024a; Faldor et al., 2025), and designs for agentic systems (Hu et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025e), among others. In this paper, we investigate whether agentic systems can learn to continually learn by automating the design of their memory components. This enables memory designs to be specialized for diverse domains without relying on manual engineering. Learning to Continually Learn via Meta-learning Agentic Memory Designs Figure 1. Open-ended Exploration Process of ALMA. The Meta Agent first ideates and proposes plan by reflecting on the code and evaluation logs of the sampled memory design. It then implements the plan by programming the new design in code. Finally, it verifies the correctness of the new memory design and evaluates it with an agentic system. The evaluated memory design is subsequently added to the memory design archive for future sampling. We propose ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems), framework that adopts Meta Agent to explore novel memory designs for agentic systems through open-ended exploration. We use code as the search space, giving ALMA the theoretical potential to build any memory design. As shown in Figure 1, the Meta Agent samples previously explored memory designs from an archive, where all explored memory designs and their evaluation logs are stored. Then the Meta Agent reflects on the sampled memory designs to generate new ideas and plans, which are implemented in code. The new designs are subsequently validated and evaluated, with the resulting logs added back to the archive to guide future sampling. We evaluate our method across four sequential decisionmaking domains, including ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021), TextWorld (Cˆote et al., 2019), Baba Is AI (Cloos et al., 2025), and MiniHack (Samvelyan et al., 2021). These domains serve as testbeds for evaluating an agents capability to continually learn from experience. In these domains, agents benefit from storing and reusing their experiences to acquire effective strategies and useful information that is absent from the FMs pre-trained knowledge. The results show that ALMA can discover memory designs that are tailored for the needs of different domains, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art human-designed memory baselines  (Table 1)  . Beyond superior performance, our learned memory designs are more cost-efficient than most human-designed memory baselines (Figure 6). Furthermore"

Geometric interference in standard diffusion transformers prevents convergence on representation encoders, which is resolved through Riemannian flow matching with jacobi regularization enabling effective training without width scaling.  					AI-generated summary 				 Leveraging representation encoders for generative modeling offers a path for efficient, high-fidelity synthesis. However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge. Code: https://github.com/amandpkr/RJF

ALMA is a framework that uses meta-learning to automatically discover memory designs for agentic systems, enabling continual learning without human engineering across diverse domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 The statelessness of foundation models bottlenecks agentic systems' ability to continually learn, a core capability for long-horizon reasoning and adaptation. To address this limitation, agentic systems commonly incorporate memory modules to retain and reuse past experience, aiming for continual learning during test time. However, most existing memory designs are human-crafted and fixed, which limits their ability to adapt to the diversity and non-stationarity of real-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems), a framework that meta-learns memory designs to replace hand-engineered memory designs, therefore minimizing human effort and enabling agentic systems to be continual learners across diverse domains. Our approach employs a Meta Agent that searches over memory designs expressed as executable code in an open-ended manner, theoretically allowing the discovery of arbitrary memory designs, including database schemas as well as their retrieval and update mechanisms. Extensive experiments across four sequential decision-making domains demonstrate that the learned memory designs enable more effective and efficient learning from experience than state-of-the-art human-crafted memory designs on all benchmarks. When developed and deployed safely, ALMA represents a step toward self-improving AI systems that learn to be adaptive, continual learners.

"ALMA is a framework that uses meta-learning to automatically discover memory designs for agentic systems, enabling continual learning without human engineering across diverse domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 The statelessness of foundation models bottlenecks agentic systems' ability to continually learn, a core capability for long-horizon reasoning and adaptation. To address this limitation, agentic systems commonly incorporate memory modules to retain and reuse past experience, aiming for continual learning during test time. However, most existing memory designs are human-crafted and fixed, which limits their ability to adapt to the diversity and non-stationarity of real-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems), a framework that meta-learns memory designs to replace hand-engineered memory designs, therefore minimizing human effort and enabling agentic systems to be continual learners across diverse domains. Our approach employs a Meta Agent that searches over memory designs expressed as executable code in an open-ended manner, theoretically allowing the discovery of arbitrary memory designs, including database schemas as well as their retrieval and update mechanisms. Extensive experiments across four sequential decision-making domains demonstrate that the learned memory designs enable more effective and efficient learning from experience than state-of-the-art human-crafted memory designs on all benchmarks. When developed and deployed safely, ALMA represents a step toward self-improving AI systems that learn to be adaptive, continual learners."
