Text:"6 2 0 2 8 ] . [ 1 9 3 8 7 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r TodoEvolve: Learning to Architect Agent Planning SystemsPlanning has become central capability for contemporary agent systems in navigating complex, longhorizon tasks, yet existing approaches predominantly rely on fixed, hand-crafted planning structures that lack the flexibility to adapt to the structural diversity of open-ended problems. To address this limitation, we introduce TodoEvolve, meta-planning paradigm that autonomously synthesizes and dynamically revises task-specific planning architectures. Specifically, we first construct PlanFactory, modular design space that standardizes diverse planning paradigms within unified codebase encompassing topology, initialization, adaptation, and navigation, thereby providing common interface for heterogeneous planning patterns. Leveraging PlanFactory, we collect high-quality planning trajectories and train Todo-14B via Impedance-Guided Preference Optimization (IGPO), multi-objective reinforcement learning objective that encourages the generation of planning systems that are performant, stable, and token-efficient across arbitrary tasks and agent backbones. Empirical evaluations on five agentic benchmarks demonstrate that TodoEvolve consistently surpasses carefully engineered planning modules while maintaining economical API costs and runtime overhead. Date: February 10, 2026 Code: https://github.com/EcthelionLiu/TodoEvolveWith the rapid advancement of foundation models (Team et al., 2025b,a,c), large language model (LLM)-powered agents have begun to demonstrate strong capabilities across domains such as deep research (Hu et al., 2025a; Shi et al., 2025b), complex software engineering (iQuest, 2025; Yang et al., 2024), and real-world transactions Andon (2025); Backlund and Petersson (2025). Beyond improvements in base model capacity, increasingly sophisticated agent scaffolds are equally critical (Wang et al., 2025a), equipping LLMs with essential agentic support including planning (Parmar et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025b; Erdogan et al., 2025a), memory (Hu et al., 2026a), reflection, etc. Among these, planning stands out as central capability, enabling agents to navigate complex environments by maintaining coherent global state, preserving behavioral consistency, and coordinating actions across tasks (Cao et al., 2025). Existing planning systems developed for LLM-based agents exhibit substantial diversity. From the perspective of planning target, some are designed to support single agent, primarily addressing long-horizon execution and mitigating the risk of lost in the middle (Erdogan et al., 2025b), while others are tailored for multi-agent systems, focusing on subtask allocation and contextual coordination across agents with distinct roles (Parmar et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025b). In terms of representational form, plans have been instantiated using wide range of structures, including linear to-do lists (LangChain, 2025), directed acyclic graphs (DAG) (Qin et al., 2025), tree-structured plans (Hu et al., 2026b), and hierarchical notes. Moreover, planning systems differ markedly across task domains, with domain-specific designs emerging for embodied action (Wang et al., 2024b), web search (Kim et al., 2024), and programming. Faced with this diversity, practitioners may naturally ask: is there single planning structure that can serve as one-size-fits-all solution that generalizes well across settings? 1 We posit that such an oracle planning system does not exist. Beyond distinct task domains require different planning priors (for instance, MCTS-based planning may be effective for mathematical reasoning yet is rarely adopted for autonomous driving agents due to the vastness of its action space (Wang et al., 2024a)), even within single task class, alternative planning priors exhibit performance disparities. For example, in web search, AOP (Li et al., 2025a) employs simple linear to-do list coupled with reward model to solve document QA in token-efficient manner, but it is substantially outperformed in more complex multimodal settings by DAG-based planning structures (Qin et al., 2025). Similarly, while linear tasks require minimal revision (Hu et al., 2025b), high-conflict environments demand continuous topological restructuring (Zhang et al., 2025), rendering single, universal planning system unrealistic. Accordingly, we contend that the central challenge is not to design one-size-fits-all planner, but to customize planning systems to the structural characteristics of each task. To this end, we propose TodoEvolve, meta-planning paradigm that synthesizes task-adaptive agentic planners and dynamically updates their planning states as execution unfolds. Concretely, we train Todo-14B using Impedance-Guided Preference Optimization (IGPO), multi-objective preference learning objective that jointly promotes high performance, stability, and token efficiency in the generated planning systems. The resulting meta-planner Todo-14B takes task instance as input and instantiates tailored planning topology, revision cadence, and navigation strategy, operationalized as task-specific to-do structure. Todo-14B integrates seamlessly with single/multi-agent execution frameworks, remains compatible with diverse LLM backbones, and generalizes across heterogeneous task domains. To ground TodoEvolve within the diverse landscape of existing planning systems, we introduce modular planning design space comprising four dimensions: Topology (the structural organization of task decomposition), Initialization (how the task topology is instantiated), Adaptation (when and how the topology is revised), and Navigation (the mechanism that issues executable directives to the acting agent). This design space provides unified abstraction capable of accommodating and localizing wide spectrum of existing planning paradigms. Building on this formulation, we decompose and re-implement ten representative planning architectures, including Plan-and-Act (Erdogan et al., 2025b), linear planning (Hu et al., 2025b), DAG-based planning (Qin et al., 2025), and parallel and dynamic planning (Zhu et al., 2025). The resulting framework, denoted as PlanFactory, serves both as (i) data synthesis engine for generating high-quality planning trajectories to train TodoEvolve and (ii) standardized codebase to facilitate future research on agentic planning capabilities. Our contributions are as follows: ❶ Unified Codebase: We introduce PlanFactory, modular "

Text:"SAFEPRED: Predictive Guardrail for Computer-Using Agents via World Models Yurun Chen 1 Zeyi Liao 2 Ping Yin 3 Taotao Xie 3 Keting Yin 1 Shengyu Zhang1. Introduction 6 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 5 2 7 1 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r With the widespread deployment of Computerusing Agents (CUAs) in complex real-world environments, prevalent long-term risks often lead to severe and irreversible consequences. Most existing guardrails for CUAs adopt reactive approach, constraining agent behavior only within the current observation space. While these guardrails can prevent immediate short-term risks (e.g., clicking on phishing link), they cannot proactively avoid long-term risks: seemingly reasonable actions can lead to high-risk consequences that emerge with delay (e.g., cleaning logs leads to future audits being untraceable), which reactive guardrails cannot identify within the current observation space. To address these limitations, we propose predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions. Based on this approach, we present SAFEPRED, predictive guardrail framework for CUAs that establishes risk-to-decision loop to ensure safe agent behavior. SAFEPRED supports two key abilities: (1) Shortand long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SAFEPRED leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning. Extensive experiments show that SAFEPRED significantly reduces high-risk behaviors, achieving over 97.6% safety performance and improving task utility by up to 21.4% compared with reactive baselines. 1Zhejiang University, China 2The Ohio State University, USA 3Inspur Cloud, China. Correspondence to: Yurun Chen <yurunchen.research@gmail.com>. Code: https://github.com/YurunChen/SafePred 1 As CUAs become increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their safety has emerged as critical concern. In response, recent research (Xiang et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025c;a) has introduced guardrails for CUAs that review inputs and constrain harmful actions prior to execution. In practice, these guardrails have demonstrated effectiveness in mitigating immediate threats, such as adversarial prompts (Liu et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023) and environment injections (Wu et al., 2024; Liao et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025b), thereby improving CUAs ability to handle short-term risks. We categorize these approaches, which assess safety based on the current (state, action) pair, as reactive guardrails. Despite their effectiveness, reactive guardrails are inherently limited to the pre-execution time window. At their core, they evaluate whether an action appears safe at the moment it is proposed, lacking the ability to predict how it may lead to risk consequences in the future. real scenario we observed in Figure 1 indicates the limitations of reactive guardrails. In this case, CUA is used to set up Python environment for project. When project requirements do not explicitly call for creating virtual environment, CUA with limited reasoning ability might try to modify the Python version in the base environment to get the code running. In the short term, this seems like harmless upgrade, and reactive guardrail would likely classify it as safe because it fixes an immediate problem. However, from long-term perspective, this action irreversibly breaks the dependencies of package managers and critical services on the system Python version, with recovery requiring costly rollback measures such as system reinstallation. This case reflects class of longterm risks that reactive guardrails cannot address: actions that appear reasonable initially but may lead to high-risk consequences in the future. These observations reveal that reactive guardrails lack the risk prediction capabilities that humans naturally possess. Through risk prediction, humans actively consider long-term risks, and incorporate this foresight into current decisions before taking action. Essentially, risk prediction moves safety decisions from evaluating the risk of individual actions to exploring potential future risk states. Motivated by this inSAFEPRED: Predictive Guardrail for Computer-Using Agents via World Models sue is further amplified in safety scenarios: even when the world model has predicted risks, the agent may still repeat high-risk actions due to the absence of decision guidance. To address these challenges, we propose SAFEPRED, world-model-based predictive guardrail for CUAs designed to translate predicted future risks into actionable safety decisions. SAFEPRED constructs unified policy representation to distinguish between benign and risky outcomes. It then leverages the world model to generate shortand long-term risk predictions from single-step states, using semantic state descriptions to avoid the state drift inherent in multi-step prediction. Furthermore, SAFEPRED converts these predictions into hierarchical guidance at both the step and task levels to inform safe decision-making, thereby establishing riskto-decision loop. We implemented prototype of the SAFEPRED and conducted experiments on multiple benchmarks (OSHarm (Kuntz et al., 2025) and WASP (Evtimov et al., 2025)). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAFEPRED significantly improves agent safety, achieving over 97.6% safety performance on all benchmarks. Moreover, by decision optimization, SAFEPRED improves task performance by 21.4% compared to the reactive baselines on WASP. Furthermore, we collect 1.5K samples from the trajectories and train lightweight predictive guardrail model SafePred-8B, which achieves safety performance comparable to Deepseek-V3.2. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We introduce predictive guardrail approach, which explicitly aligns predicted future risks with current decisions, addressing the inherent limitations of existing reactive guardrails. We propose SAFEPRED, prediction guardrail for CUAs that transforms the predictive capabilities of LLM-based world models into actionable safety signals. By integrating risk prediction with decision optimization, it provides effective safety constraints and guidance for decision making. We implement prototype of S"

TodoEvolve enables autonomous synthesis and revision of task-specific planning architectures through a modular design space and multi-objective reinforcement learning optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Planning has become a central capability for contemporary agent systems in navigating complex, long-horizon tasks, yet existing approaches predominantly rely on fixed, hand-crafted planning structures that lack the flexibility to adapt to the structural diversity of open-ended problems. To address this limitation, we introduce TodoEvolve, a meta-planning paradigm that autonomously synthesizes and dynamically revises task-specific planning architectures. Specifically, we first construct PlanFactory, a modular design space that standardizes diverse planning paradigms within a unified codebase encompassing topology, initialization, adaptation, and navigation, thereby providing a common interface for heterogeneous planning patterns. Leveraging PlanFactory, we collect high-quality planning trajectories and train Todo-14B via Impedance-Guided Preference Optimization (IGPO), a multi-objective reinforcement learning objective that encourages the generation of planning systems that are performant, stable, and token-efficient across arbitrary tasks and agent backbones. Empirical evaluations on five agentic benchmarks demonstrate that TodoEvolve consistently surpasses carefully engineered planning modules while maintaining economical API costs and runtime overhead.

STEER2ADAPT is a lightweight framework that adapts large language models by composing steering vectors from reusable semantic prior subspaces, enabling efficient and flexible task adaptation through linear combinations of basis vectors.  					AI-generated summary 				 Activation steering has emerged as a promising approach for efficiently adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream behaviors. However, most existing steering methods rely on a single static direction per task or concept, making them inflexible under task variation and inadequate for complex tasks that require multiple coordinated capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose STEER2ADAPT, a lightweight framework that adapts LLMs by composing steering vectors rather than learning new ones from scratch. In many domains (e.g., reasoning or safety), tasks share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. STEER2ADAPT captures these dimensions as a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace, and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors from only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of STEER2ADAPT, achieving an average improvement of 8.2%. Extensive analyses further show that STEER2ADAPT is a data-efficient, stable, and transparent inference-time adaptation method for LLMs.
