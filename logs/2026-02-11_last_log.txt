Text:"Archiki Prasad* 1 Mandar Joshi 2 Kenton Lee 2 Mohit Bansal 1 Peter ShawChain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and its variants have substantially improved the performance of language models on complex reasoning tasks, yet the precise mechanisms by which different strategies facilitate generalization remain poorly understood. While current explanations often point to increased test-time computation or structural guidance, establishing consistent, quantifiable link between these factors and generalization remains challenging. In this work, we identify intrinsic dimensionality as quantitative measure for characterizing the effectiveness of reasoning chains. Intrinsic dimensionality quantifies the minimum number of model dimensions needed to reach given accuracy threshold on given task. By keeping the model architecture fixed and varying the task formulation through different reasoning strategies, we demonstrate that effective reasoning strategies consistently reduce the intrinsic dimensionality of the task. Validating this on GSM8K with Gemma-3 1B and 4B, we observe strong inverse correlation between the intrinsic dimensionality of reasoning strategy and its generalization performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Our findings suggest that effective reasoning chains facilitate learning by better compressing the task using fewer parameters, offering new quantitative metric for analyzing reasoning processes. 6 2 0 2 9 ] . [ 1 6 7 2 9 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r 1. Introduction Chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) whether through fewshot prompting (Wei et al., 2022), zero-shot prompting (Kojima et al., 2022), or various post-training methods (Zelikman et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2024) has substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks by generating textual rationales before 1UNC Chapel Hill 2Google DeepMind. *Work partially done during an internship at Google DeepMind. Correspondence to: Archiki Prasad <archiki@cs.unc.edu>. Preprint. February 11, 2026. 1 final answers. Subsequent work has proposed numerous variations with different stylistic and strategic features, including code-based solutions (Gao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023), decomposition strategies (Zhou et al., 2023; Khot et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b), and extended reasoning with verification loops (Snell et al., 2024; Muennighoff et al., 2025). These variations represent different ways of communicating problem-solving strategies and structuring solutions analogous to how humans adapt their communication style to their interlocutor in dialogue (Pickering & Garrod, 2004; Giles et al., 1991). Empirical evidence shows different reasoning strategies yield varying performance across tasks (Zhou et al., 2024), consistent with the intuition that different solution approaches suit different problems or learners. Further, not all problems benefit from generating rationales prior to the answer (Sprague et al., 2025). This motivates an important research question: when and why is reasoning effective, and given different reasoning strategies, which is most effective for improving model performance? Existing explanations in prior work suffer from notable limitations. First, qualitative hypotheses about the importance of structure or relevance of reasoning chains are not quantifiable (Wang et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2025). Consequently, these hypotheses are subject to interpretation, limiting both their predictive capacity and the ability to offer theoretically grounded explanation for what makes reasoning effective. On the other hand, prevalent quantitative measures are often associated with conflicting evidence. For example, the relationship between the length of reasoning trajectories and the subsequent increased inference-time computational capacity remains unclear; while some works find clear gains (Muennighoff et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025), other work reports that shorter chains can be more effective and that continuing to extend reasoning (e.g., via wait tokens) can yield degradation in performance (Wu et al., 2025; Marjanovic et al., 2025). Current approaches such as process reward models or correctness-based classifiers also require subjective specifications of desirable properties and do not provide principled measure of effectiveness. reliable quantitative measure would have significant practical implications: it could inform how to annotate or collect reasoning data, how to align reasoning strategies to particular student models, and how to design better regularizers that avoid limiting exploration or reward models grounded Effective Reasoning Chains Reduce Intrinsic Dimensionality in generalization principles rather than subjective criteria. To address this gap, we draw on the long-standing literature that uses information-theoretic perspectives to explain the efficacy of neural networks. Foundational concepts such as the minimum description length principle (Rissanen, 1978; Grunwald, 2007) posit an inverse relationship between the capacity required to represent solution and its expected generalization. Building on this, the notion of intrinsic dimensionality (Li et al., 2018; Aghajanyan et al., 2021) applies these insights for overparameterized models, measuring the effective number of parameters needed to fit given task objective. Specifically, intrinsic dimensionality is function of both the model and the task. While prior work has typically fixed the data to analyze how different models vary in their intrinsic dimensionality, we instead fix the model and vary the training data by changing the reasoning strategy used to generate solutions. Although the underlying capability required (e.g., solving math problems) remains constant, different reasoning strategies change the supervision provided to the model during training. In this context, one might intuitively expect that requiring model to generate long reasoning chains alongside final answers would increase the complexity of the outputs, making the task harder to fit. However, we hypothesize the opposite for effective reasoning: if reasoning strategy effectively bridges the logical gap between input and answer, it should render the underlying mapping more compressible, requiring fewer degrees of freedom to learn, thereby resulting in lower intrinsic dimensionality. We demonstrate strong inverse correlation between intrinsic dimensionality and generalization performance across multiple chain-of-thought variants on GSM8K (C"

In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as library of modular utility models rather than monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%.

Text:"Tianyi Wu 1 Mingzhe Du 1 2 Yue Liu 1 Chengran Yang 3 Yue Zhuo 4 5 Jiaheng Zhang 1 See-Kiong Ng 1 6 2 0 2 7 ] . [ 1 2 2 4 7 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development, yet their tendency to generate insecure code remains major barrier to real-world deployment. Existing secure code alignment methods often suffer from functionalitysecurity paradox, improving security at the cost of substantial utility degradation. We propose SecCoderX, an online reinforcement learning framework for functionalitypreserving secure code generation. SecCoderX first bridges vulnerability detection and secure code generation by repurposing mature detection resources in two ways: (i) synthesizing diverse, reality-grounded vulnerability-inducing coding tasks for online RL rollouts, and (ii) training reasoning-based vulnerability reward model that provides scalable and reliable security supervision. Together, these components are unified in an online RL loop to align code LLMs to generate secure and functional code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecCoderX achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Effective Safety Rate (ESR) by approximately 10% over unaligned models, whereas prior methods often degrade ESR by 14-54%. We release our code, dataset and model checkpoints at https: //github.com/AndrewWTY/SecCoderX. 1.

Effective chain-of-thought reasoning strategies reduce intrinsic dimensionality, leading to better generalization by requiring fewer model parameters to achieve given accuracy thresholds.  					AI-generated summary 				 Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and its variants have substantially improved the performance of language models on complex reasoning tasks, yet the precise mechanisms by which different strategies facilitate generalization remain poorly understood. While current explanations often point to increased test-time computation or structural guidance, establishing a consistent, quantifiable link between these factors and generalization remains challenging. In this work, we identify intrinsic dimensionality as a quantitative measure for characterizing the effectiveness of reasoning chains. Intrinsic dimensionality quantifies the minimum number of model dimensions needed to reach a given accuracy threshold on a given task. By keeping the model architecture fixed and varying the task formulation through different reasoning strategies, we demonstrate that effective reasoning strategies consistently reduce the intrinsic dimensionality of the task. Validating this on GSM8K with Gemma-3 1B and 4B, we observe a strong inverse correlation between the intrinsic dimensionality of a reasoning strategy and its generalization performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Our findings suggest that effective reasoning chains facilitate learning by better compressing the task using fewer parameters, offering a new quantitative metric for analyzing reasoning processes.

AI-generated summary 				 Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and its variants have substantially improved the performance of language models on complex reasoning tasks, yet the precise mechanisms by which different strategies facilitate generalization remain poorly understood. While current explanations often point to increased test-time computation or structural guidance, establishing a consistent, quantifiable link between these factors and generalization remains challenging. In this work, we identify intrinsic dimensionality as a quantitative measure for characterizing the effectiveness of reasoning chains. Intrinsic dimensionality quantifies the minimum number of model dimensions needed to reach a given accuracy threshold on a given task. By keeping the model architecture fixed and varying the task formulation through different reasoning strategies, we demonstrate that effective reasoning strategies consistently reduce the intrinsic dimensionality of the task. Validating this on GSM8K with Gemma-3 1B and 4B, we observe a strong inverse correlation between the intrinsic dimensionality of a reasoning strategy and its generalization performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Our findings suggest that effective reasoning chains facilitate learning by better compressing the task using fewer parameters, offering a new quantitative metric for analyzing reasoning processes."

Contact-Anchored Policies replace language conditioning with physical contact points and use modular utility models for robust manipulation, achieving superior zero-shot performance with minimal demonstration data through real-to-sim iteration cycles.  					AI-generated summary 				 The prevalent paradigm in robot learning attempts to generalize across environments, embodiments, and tasks with language prompts at runtime. A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement a real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced. Project page: https://cap-policy.github.io/

ContextBench evaluates context retrieval in coding agents through detailed process analysis, revealing that advanced agent designs provide limited improvements in context usage while highlighting gaps between explored and utilized information.  					AI-generated summary 				 LLM-based coding agents have shown strong performance on automated issue resolution benchmarks, yet existing evaluations largely focus on final task success, providing limited insight into how agents retrieve and use code context during problem solving. We introduce ContextBench, a process-oriented evaluation of context retrieval in coding agents. ContextBench consists of 1,136 issue-resolution tasks from 66 repositories across eight programming languages, each augmented with human-annotated gold contexts. We further implement an automated evaluation framework that tracks agent trajectories and measures context recall, precision, and efficiency throughout issue resolution. Using ContextBench, we evaluate four frontier LLMs and five coding agents. Our results show that sophisticated agent scaffolding yields only marginal gains in context retrieval ("The Bitter Lesson" of coding agents), LLMs consistently favor recall over precision, and substantial gaps exist between explored and utilized context. ContextBench augments existing end-to-end benchmarks with intermediate gold-context metrics that unbox the issue-resolution process. These contexts offer valuable intermediate signals for guiding LLM reasoning in software tasks.

Test-time training fails in verification-grounded tasks due to over-sharpening, while surprisal-guided selection improves performance by favoring diverse, low-confidence samples.  					AI-generated summary 				 Test-time training (TTT) adapts language models through gradient-based updates at inference. But is adaptation the right strategy? We study compute-optimal test-time strategies for verifiable execution-grounded (VEG) tasks, domains like GPU kernel optimization where a deterministic evaluator provides dense, continuous reward signals. Using KernelBench as our testbed and a 120B-parameter model (GPT-OSS-120B with LoRA adaptation), we find that search outperforms minimal adaptation (1-5 gradient steps): Best-of-N sampling achieves 90% task success (18/20 tasks) at K=64 across the full KernelBench L1 eval set while TTT's best checkpoint reaches only 30.6% (3-seed mean), with TTT's "equivalent K" falling below 1, worse than single-sample inference. The failure mode is over-sharpening: gradient updates collapse diversity toward mediocre solutions rather than discovering optimal ones. Our main contribution is surprisal-guided selection: selecting the highest-surprisal (lowest-confidence) correct sample yields 80% success vs. 50% for most-confident selection, a 30% improvement. Extending to surprisal-guided-top3 matches oracle performance at 100%. This zero-cost strategy, validated through length-controlled analysis, recovers oracle performance. For dense-reward VEG tasks, compute should be allocated to sample diversity and intelligent selection rather than gradient adaptation. The surprisal-guided selection principle may generalize to other execution-grounded domains where optimal solutions occupy the distribution tail.

SecCoderX uses online reinforcement learning to align large language models for secure code generation while preserving functionality, addressing the functionality-security trade-off through vulnerability detection integration and reward modeling.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development, yet their tendency to generate insecure code remains a major barrier to real-world deployment. Existing secure code alignment methods often suffer from a functionality--security paradox, improving security at the cost of substantial utility degradation. We propose SecCoderX, an online reinforcement learning framework for functionality-preserving secure code generation. SecCoderX first bridges vulnerability detection and secure code generation by repurposing mature detection resources in two ways: (i) synthesizing diverse, reality-grounded vulnerability-inducing coding tasks for online RL rollouts, and (ii) training a reasoning-based vulnerability reward model that provides scalable and reliable security supervision. Together, these components are unified in an online RL loop to align code LLMs to generate secure and functional code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecCoderX achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Effective Safety Rate (ESR) by approximately 10% over unaligned models, whereas prior methods often degrade ESR by 14-54%. We release our code, dataset and model checkpoints at https://github.com/AndrewWTY/SecCoderX.
