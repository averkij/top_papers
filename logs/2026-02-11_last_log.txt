Qingan Liu * 1 Juntong Feng * 1 Yuhao Wang * 1 Xinzhe Han 1 Yujie Cheng 1 Yue Zhu 1 Haiwen Diao 2 Yunzhi Zhuge 1 Huchuan Lu 1 6 2 0 2 4 ] . [ 1 2 0 8 4 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aVisionLanguage Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels. The source dataset is available at VISTA-Bench. 1. Introduction Recent visionlanguage models (VLMs) (Bai et al., 2025a; Wang et al., 2025; Diao et al., 2024; 2025b;a) extend large language models (LLMs) (Yang et al., 2025; Grattafiori et al., 2024; Cai et al., 2024) to diverse tasks by treating visual tokens and text queries as standard inputs. Accordingly, existing benchmarks predominantly assume pure-text 1School of Artificial Intelligence, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China 2S-Lab, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Correspondence to: Haiwen Diao <haiwen.diao@ntu.edu.sg>, Yunzhi Zhuge <zgyz@dlut.edu.cn>. Preprint. February 5, 2026. queries. However, real-world scenarios also embed language directly within visual content in Figure 1(a), raising fundamental question: Do visionlanguage models truly understand visualized text as well as pure text? Recent explorations such as DeepSeek-OCR (Wei et al., 2025) and Glyph (Cheng et al., 2025) point to growing text-as-pixels paradigm, in which text is rendered into image to reduce token overhead in long contexts and to establish unified perceptual interface across modalities. Crucially, replacing pure-text queries with visualized text fundamentally alters the input pathway in Figure 1(b), forcing all information to be processed through unified modality. These developments expose an interesting and underexplored challenge: whether foundation models can preserve semantic fidelity and cross-modal alignment when language is represented as pixels, especially in terms of visuallanguage understanding and unified model architecture design in the future. Notably, existing VLM evaluation protocols remain largely text-centric, spanning both standard language reasoning benchmarks (Hendrycks et al., 2020) and widely used multimodal benchmarks (Liu et al., 2024b; Yue et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024a). This blind spot overlooks the perceptual challenge of reading language from pixels, leaving it unclear whether model behavior remains stable when language isnt conveyed symbolically. Fortunately, some concurrent works start to expose this gap. VTCBench (Zhao et al., 2025) reports significant performance degradation when text-only tasks are converted to visualized text. Impressively, Gemini-3-Pro (Google, 2025) exhibits tiny modality gap, highlighting the potential for modality-equivalent representations. However, existing analyses are largely confined to unimodal settings. It therefore remains unclear whether similar phenomena persist in multimodal tasks from perception to reasoning and how they manifest in such scenarios. To address this question, we uncover pronounced modality gap between pure-text and visualized-text inputs through preliminary experiments. We then introduce VISTA-Bench, benchmark of 1,500 carefully filtered samples designed for rigorous comparison under strictly matched pure-text and visualized-text conditions. VISTA-Bench is built through three-stage pipeline that curates high-quality questions, VISTA-Bench: Do Vision-Language Models Really Understand Visualized Text as Well as Pure Text? Figure 1. (a) Humans integrate visual context with embedded text, whereas standard VLM evaluation provides language as discrete tokens. (b) Presenting language as visualized text can induce behavioral deviations from pure-text inputs, revealing modality gap. renders text into diverse visual layouts, and enforces fidelity via VLM-based verification. It contains multiple-choice questions and organizes them under hierarchical capability taxonomy spanning perception, reasoning, and knowledge. Evaluating over 20 state-of-the-art VLMs, we uncover pervasive modality gap that is consistently amplified by perceptually challenging renderings. Our analysis attributes this gap primarily to limited perceptual robustness, while additional visual grounding offers only partial mitigation. Notably, MiMo-VL-7B-RL (MiMo, 2025) stands out as rare exception, exhibiting markedly stronger robustness under visualized-text inputs. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides principled testbed for diagnosing modality gaps under realistic text-as-pixels inputs and underscores the need for more robust unified representations in future VLMs. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: Exposing modality non-equivalence phenomenon. We uncover comprehensive analyses across multimodality perception, reasoning, and knowledge tasks when text is presented as pixels rather than symbols. Defining systematic visualized-text benchmark. VISTA-Bench is rigorously controlled and easy-todeploy benchmark, filling blind spot in evaluating the gap between pure-text and visualized-text inputs. Providing text-as-pixels diagnosis and outlook. Large-scale analyses identify limited perceptual robustness as the core driver of the modality gap, and VISTA-Bench elevates text-as-pixels to foundational challenge for unified visionlanguage representations. 2.

Auto-regressive video generation suffers from temporal drift due to error accumulation in latent conditioning tokens, which is addressed by identifying and removing unstable tokens during inference to improve long-horizon consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Auto-regressive video generation enables long video synthesis by iteratively conditioning each new batch of frames on previously generated content. However, recent work has shown that such pipelines suffer from severe temporal drift, where errors accumulate and amplify over long horizons. We hypothesize that this drift does not primarily stem from insufficient model capacity, but rather from inference-time error propagation. Specifically, we contend that drift arises from the uncontrolled reuse of corrupted latent conditioning tokens during auto-regressive inference. To correct this accumulation of errors, we propose a simple, inference-time method that mitigates temporal drift by identifying and removing unstable latent tokens before they are reused for conditioning. For this purpose, we define unstable tokens as latent tokens whose representations deviate significantly from those of the previously generated batch, indicating potential corruption or semantic drift. By explicitly removing corrupted latent tokens from the auto-regressive context, rather than modifying entire spatial regions or model parameters, our method prevents unreliable latent information from influencing future generation steps. As a result, it significantly improves long-horizon temporal consistency without modifying the model architecture, training procedure, or leaving latent space.

VISTA-Bench evaluates vision-language models' ability to understand visualized text versus pure-text queries, revealing significant performance gaps and sensitivity to rendering variations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels. The source dataset is available at https://github.com/QingAnLiu/VISTA-Bench.

"VISTA-Bench evaluates vision-language models' ability to understand visualized text versus pure-text queries, revealing significant performance gaps and sensitivity to rendering variations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels. The source dataset is available at https://github.com/QingAnLiu/VISTA-Bench."

Offline selective refusal in large language models is achieved through circuit-restricted weight updates that eliminate runtime intervention costs while maintaining performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Modern deployments require LLMs to enforce safety policies at scale, yet many controls rely on inference-time interventions that add recurring compute cost and serving complexity. Activation steering is widely used, but it requires runtime hooks and scales cost with the number of generations; conditional variants improve selectivity by gating when steering is applied but still retain an inference-time control path. We ask whether selective refusal can be moved entirely offline: can a mechanistic understanding of category-specific refusal be distilled into a circuit-restricted weight update that deploys as a standard checkpoint? We propose C-Δθ: Circuit Restricted Weight Arithmetic, which (i) localizes refusal-causal computation as a sparse circuit using EAP-IG and (ii) computes a constrained weight update ΔθC supported only on that circuit (typically <5% of parameters). Applying ΔθC yields a drop-in edited checkpoint with no inference-time hooks, shifting cost from per-request intervention to a one-time offline update. We evaluate category-targeted selectivity and capability retention on refusal and utility benchmarks.
