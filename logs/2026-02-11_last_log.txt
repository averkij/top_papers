Introduction 6 2 0 2 0 1 ] . [ 1 2 6 6 9 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Effectively scaling GUI automation is essential for computer-use agents (CUAs); however, existing work primarily focuses on scaling GUI grounding rather than the more crucial GUI planning, which requires more sophisticated data collection. In reality, the exploration process of CUA across apps/desktops/web pages typically follows tree structure, with earlier functional entry points often being explored more frequently. Thus, organizing large-scale trajectories into tree structures can reduce data cost and streamline the data scaling of GUI planning. In this work, we propose TreeCUA to efficiently scale GUI automation with tree-structured verifiable evolution. We propose multi-agent collaborative framework to explore the environment, verify actions, summarize trajectories, and evaluate quality to generate high-quality and scalable GUI trajectories. To improve efficiency, we devise novel tree-based topology to store and replay duplicate exploration nodes, and design an adaptive exploration algorithm to balance the depth (i.e., trajectory difficulty) and breadth (i.e., trajectory diversity). Moreover, we develop world knowledge guidance and global memory backtracking to avoid low-quality generation. Finally, we naturally extend and propose the TreeCUADPO method from abundant tree node information, improving GUI planning capability by referring to the branch information of adjacent trajectories. Experimental results show that TreeCUA and TreeCUA-DPO offer significant improvements, and out-of-domain (OOD) studies further demonstrate strong generalization. All trajectory node information and code will be available at https://github.com/UITron-hub/TreeCUA. *Equal contribution 1Meituan, Beijing, China. Correspondence to: Zhixiong Zeng <zengzhixiong@meituan.com>. Preprint. February 11, 2026. 1 Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) represent paradigm shift towards general-purpose digital agents, capable of perceiving and interacting with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) in human-like manner (OpenAI, 2025). Leveraging the emergent capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) (Bai et al., 2025; Comanici et al., 2025), these agents process high-resolution visual inputs to execute intricate instructionfollowing tasks. The field has been significantly shaped by proprietary frontier models such as Gemini (Comanici et al., 2025) and Claude (Anthropic, 2025), which have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in complex agentic workflows. Concurrently, open-source initiatives are accelerating efforts to scale CUA models and data pipelines to bridge the gap with proprietary systems. Representative models (Qin et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2024) have successfully scaled capabilities across desktop, mobile, and web platforms, underscoring the immense potential for generalized digital intelligence. However, distinct from the rapid scaling of model parameters, scaling high-quality training data incurs significantly higher costs and complexity. Although recent works (Cheng et al., 2024a; Xie et al., 2025; Chai et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2025) have successfully scaled GUI grounding datasets, these efforts focus primarily on static element recognition. In contrast, efficiently scaling long-horizon planning trajectories necessitates temporal reasoning and dynamic interaction, remaining largely unexplored challenge. To address this challenge, recent CUA methods like OpenCUA (Wang et al., 2025) and ScaleCUA (Liu et al., 2025) collect human computer-use demonstrations or human expert annotations to construct GUI trajectories. Unfortunately, existing methods often rely on necessary human annotations, making it difficult to scale effectively to large-scale trajectory synthesis. As result, open-source trajectories currently available in this field remain very scarce. Efficiently scaling GUI trajectory requires addressing two key challenges: step redundancy and trajectory diversity. Step redundancy intensifies with increasing trajectory scale, as different app/desktop/webpage trajectories inevitably repeat the exploration of early functional entry points. TrajecTreeCUA: Efficiently Scaling GUI Automation with Tree-Structured Verifiable Evolution tory diversity depends primarily on the distillation model in automated trajectory synthesis, as the models inherent bias favors high-frequency exploration behaviors, potentially leading to insufficiently diverse and long-tail trajectories. In this paper, we devise an efficient way to scale GUI automation by eliminating step redundancy through organizing large-scale trajectories into tree structure and improving trajectory diversity through world knowledge guidance. Thus we propose TreeCUA, novel data synthesis framework of tree-structured verifiable evolution, and design training recipe of two-stage SFT protocol for establishing foundational and cognitive capabilities. To this end, we develop an automated multi-agent collaborative framework to collect tree-structured verifiable synthesis trajectories, including an exploration agent, verification agent, summary agent and an evaluation agent to explore the environment, verify actions, summarize trajectories, and evaluate quality. To achieve efficiency and scalability, we devise novel tree-based topology to store and reuse intermediate exploration nodes. Moreover, we design an adaptive exploration algorithm to balance trajectory depth (difficulty) and breadth (diversity) within the tree exploration, augmented by world knowledge guidance and global memory backtracking to strictly filter low-quality generations. In particular, leveraging the rich tree-structured data, we naturally extended TreeCUA to TreeCUA-DPO through reinforcement learning. By utilizing the branching information from adjacent trajectories as distinct preference pairs, this method significantly enhances the model planning capabilities. Experimental results on OSWorld (Xie et al., 2024) and out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks demonstrate that both TreeCUA and TreeCUADPO significantly improve task success rates in online environments, while also exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

[ 1 1 6 1 6 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aParallel diffusion decoding can accelerate diffusion language model inference by unmasking multiple tokens per step, but aggressive parallelism often harms quality. Revocable decoding mitigates this by rechecking earlier tokens, yet we observe that existing verification schemes frequently trigger flip-flop oscillations, where tokens are remasked and later restored unchanged. This behaviour slows inference in two ways: remasking verified positions weakens the conditioning context for parallel drafting, and repeated remask cycles consume the revision budget with little net progress. We propose COVER (Cache Override Verification for Efficient Revision), which performs leave-one-out verification and stable drafting within single forward pass. COVER constructs two attention views via KV cache override: selected seeds are masked for verification, while their cached key value states are injected for all other queries to preserve contextual information, with closed form diagonal correction preventing self leakage at the seed positions. COVER further prioritises seeds using stability aware score that balances uncertainty, downstream influence, and cache drift, and it adapts the number of verified seeds per step. Across benchmarks, COVER markedly reduces unnecessary revisions and yields faster decoding while preserving output quality. 1.

Flip-flop behaviour on HumanEval for Dream-Instruct7B and LLaDA-Instruct-8B under two revocable baselines (Saber, WINO) and ours (COVER). Unlike baselines that repeatedly ReMask, COVER uses context-preserving in-place verification to reduce oscillatory revisions while maintaining generation quality. Narasimhan, 2018) generate text token by token and remain the dominant paradigm for high quality generation. Yet this sequential decoding is persistent inference bottleneck, and early errors can propagate through the remainder of the output (Valmeekam et al., 2023; Stechly et al., 2023). Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer an appealing alternative: they denoise an initially masked sequence and can, in principle, update many positions in parallel (Li et al., 2022b). In practice, however, aggressive parallel unmasking often harms generation quality (Hong et al., 2025; Dong et al., 2025), so dLLMs frequently revert to conservative decoding that unmasks only one position per step, largely sacrificing the promised speed gains (Nie et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2025). Recent work attempts to bridge this gap with revocable parallel diffusion decoding. These methods draft multiple tokens in parallel and then revisit subset of previously unmasked positions using the newly available context, optionally revoking them by resetting to [MASK]. WINO (Hong et al., 2025) performs verification through an auxiliary shadow block, whereas Saber (Dong et al., 2025) triggers remasking based on confidence drops. Although revocation imStop the Flip-Flop: Context-Preserving Verification for Fast Revocable Diffusion Decoding proves robustness, existing verification mechanisms introduce substantial overhead. WINO increases effective sequence length and memory footprint, and both methods depend on explicit remasking, which replaces content tokens with [MASK] for all queries and can destabilise subsequent drafts, leading to slower net denoising progress. In this work, we highlight an inefficiency of revocable decoding that standard accuracy metrics do not capture. We observe flip-flop oscillations, where position is remasked and later re-unmasked to exactly the same token. Figure 1 shows that such oscillations occur frequently under existing revocable baselines across dLLMs, indicating that many verification actions consume iterations without producing correction. This creates two coupled inefficiencies. First, remasking replaces content bearing embedding with [MASK], weakening the conditioning context used by other positions during parallel drafting. Second, each ineffective remask spends future unmask budget merely to restore the same token, reducing net denoising progress under any fixed step or unmask budget. To solve this, we propose COVER (Cache Override Verification for Efficient Revision), context-preserving single-pass verification mechanism for revocable parallel diffusion decoding. At each step, COVER rechecks small seed set by masking these positions in the input while overriding their KV states with cached values from the previous step. This dual view computation keeps the drafting context for all non seed queries unchanged, yet enables faithful leave one out verification on the seeds via diagonal correction that removes self leakage. To make cache reuse reliable, COVER chooses seeds using stability aware score that trades off uncertainty against estimated influence on the remaining masked positions, adapts the verification token number per step, and updates verified positions by KEEP, REPLACE, or REMASK to avoid ineffective remasking cycles. Our contributions are as follows: We identify flip-flop oscillations as dominant inefficiency in revocable diffusion decoding and show how explicit remasking weakens drafting context and wastes the revision budget. We introduce an in place KV cache override verification mechanism with diagonal correction, enabling faithful leave-one-out checks and stable parallel drafting within single forward pass. We propose stability aware and adaptive seed selection that prioritises uncertain and influential positions while avoiding unstable cache reuse, enabling efficient multitoken verification. We show that COVER improves accuracy while substantially reducing decoding steps, yielding consis2 tent end-to-end speedups of up to 11.64 (Dream-Ins7B), which supports reliable multi-token drafting via context-preserving in-place v"

TreeCUA enables efficient GUI automation scaling through tree-structured trajectory organization and multi-agent collaboration, improving GUI planning capabilities via adaptive exploration and trajectory verification.  					AI-generated summary 				 Effectively scaling GUI automation is essential for computer-use agents (CUAs); however, existing work primarily focuses on scaling GUI grounding rather than the more crucial GUI planning, which requires more sophisticated data collection. In reality, the exploration process of a CUA across apps/desktops/web pages typically follows a tree structure, with earlier functional entry points often being explored more frequently. Thus, organizing large-scale trajectories into tree structures can reduce data cost and streamline the data scaling of GUI planning. In this work, we propose TreeCUA to efficiently scale GUI automation with tree-structured verifiable evolution. We propose a multi-agent collaborative framework to explore the environment, verify actions, summarize trajectories, and evaluate quality to generate high-quality and scalable GUI trajectories. To improve efficiency, we devise a novel tree-based topology to store and replay duplicate exploration nodes, and design an adaptive exploration algorithm to balance the depth (i.e., trajectory difficulty) and breadth (i.e., trajectory diversity). Moreover, we develop world knowledge guidance and global memory backtracking to avoid low-quality generation. Finally, we naturally extend and propose the TreeCUA-DPO method from abundant tree node information, improving GUI planning capability by referring to the branch information of adjacent trajectories. Experimental results show that TreeCUA and TreeCUA-DPO offer significant improvements, and out-of-domain (OOD) studies further demonstrate strong generalization. All trajectory node information and code will be available at https://github.com/UITron-hub/TreeCUA.

Modulation-based text conditioning in diffusion transformers provides performance benefits when used as guidance for controllable generation rather than just as attention mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion transformers typically incorporate textual information via attention layers and a modulation mechanism using a pooled text embedding. Nevertheless, recent approaches discard modulation-based text conditioning and rely exclusively on attention. In this paper, we address whether modulation-based text conditioning is necessary and whether it can provide any performance advantage. Our analysis shows that, in its conventional usage, the pooled embedding contributes little to overall performance, suggesting that attention alone is generally sufficient for faithfully propagating prompt information. However, we reveal that the pooled embedding can provide significant gains when used from a different perspective-serving as guidance and enabling controllable shifts toward more desirable properties. This approach is training-free, simple to implement, incurs negligible runtime overhead, and can be applied to various diffusion models, bringing improvements across diverse tasks, including text-to-image/video generation and image editing.

Однако, когда эта же модуляция используется как guidance для управляемого генерирования, она обеспечивает существенные улучшения в качестве выходных данных.

"Modulation-based text conditioning in diffusion transformers provides performance benefits when used as guidance for controllable generation rather than just as attention mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion transformers typically incorporate textual information via attention layers and a modulation mechanism using a pooled text embedding. Nevertheless, recent approaches discard modulation-based text conditioning and rely exclusively on attention. In this paper, we address whether modulation-based text conditioning is necessary and whether it can provide any performance advantage. Our analysis shows that, in its conventional usage, the pooled embedding contributes little to overall performance, suggesting that attention alone is generally sufficient for faithfully propagating prompt information. However, we reveal that the pooled embedding can provide significant gains when used from a different perspective-serving as guidance and enabling controllable shifts toward more desirable properties. This approach is training-free, simple to implement, incurs negligible runtime overhead, and can be applied to various diffusion models, bringing improvements across diverse tasks, including text-to-image/video generation and image editing."

COVER enables efficient parallel decoding for diffusion language models by implementing cache override verification that reduces unnecessary revisions and maintains output quality through stable drafting and attention view construction.  					AI-generated summary 				 Parallel diffusion decoding can accelerate diffusion language model inference by unmasking multiple tokens per step, but aggressive parallelism often harms quality. Revocable decoding mitigates this by rechecking earlier tokens, yet we observe that existing verification schemes frequently trigger flip-flop oscillations, where tokens are remasked and later restored unchanged. This behaviour slows inference in two ways: remasking verified positions weakens the conditioning context for parallel drafting, and repeated remask cycles consume the revision budget with little net progress. We propose COVER (Cache Override Verification for Efficient Revision), which performs leave-one-out verification and stable drafting within a single forward pass. COVER constructs two attention views via KV cache override: selected seeds are masked for verification, while their cached key value states are injected for all other queries to preserve contextual information, with a closed form diagonal correction preventing self leakage at the seed positions. COVER further prioritises seeds using a stability aware score that balances uncertainty, downstream influence, and cache drift, and it adapts the number of verified seeds per step. Across benchmarks, COVER markedly reduces unnecessary revisions and yields faster decoding while preserving output quality.

COVER использует технику переопределения KV-кэша для одновременной верификации и стабильного генерирования токенов в одном forward pass, при этом сохраняя контекстную информацию и предотвращая саморазрушение.

LLMs' internal representations can predict problem difficulty and enable efficient inference routing that reduces costs while maintaining performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Running LLMs with extended reasoning on every problem is expensive, but determining which inputs actually require additional compute remains challenging. We investigate whether their own likelihood of success is recoverable from their internal representations before generation, and if this signal can guide more efficient inference. We train linear probes on pre-generation activations to predict policy-specific success on math and coding tasks, substantially outperforming surface features such as question length and TF-IDF. Using E2H-AMC, which provides both human and model performance on identical problems, we show that models encode a model-specific notion of difficulty that is distinct from human difficulty, and that this distinction increases with extended reasoning. Leveraging these probes, we demonstrate that routing queries across a pool of models can exceed the best-performing model whilst reducing inference cost by up to 70\% on MATH, showing that internal representations enable practical efficiency gains even when they diverge from human intuitions about difficulty.
