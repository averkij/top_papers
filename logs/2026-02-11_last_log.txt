Text:"Agent World Model: Zhaoyang Wang 1 Canwen Xu 2 Boyi Liu 2 Yite Wang 2 Siwei Han 1 Zhewei Yao 2 Huaxiu Yao * 1 Yuxiong He * 2 6 2 0 2 0 1 ] . [ 1 0 9 0 0 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aRecent advances in large language model (LLM) have empowered autonomous agents to perform complex tasks that require multi-turn interactions with tools and environments. However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are codedriven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization. The code is available at https://github.com /Snowflake-Labs/agent-world-model. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in instruction following, reasoning, code generation, and tool-use (Chen et al., 2021; Schick et al., 2023; These authors contributed equally and share last authorship. Work done during Zhaoyang Wangs internship at Snowflake. 1University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 2Snowflake. Correspondence to: Canwen Xu <canwen.xu@snowflake.com>. Preprint. February 11, 2026. Figure 1. Agent World Model (AWM) is synthetic environment generation pipeline that synthesizes 1,000 diverse code-driven agentic environments with databases for training tool-use agents. OpenAI, 2025; Anthropic, 2025a; Comanici et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025). Agents powered by LLMs emerge as promising paradigm for handling multi-step complex tasks in realistic environments (Nakano et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024; Qin et al., 2024). However, training such agents often requires performing large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse environments that are relatively resource-scarce and expensive to scale. Using real-world environments for training is prohibitively expensive and hard to scale, since many scenarios do not expose public APIs and RL training often requires agents to interact with them thousands of times in stable and efficient manner (Dulac-Arnold et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024a; Luo et al., 2025). Human-created environments are hard to scale and often lack diversity. For example, τ 2-bench (Barres et al., 2025) and TheMCPCompany (Esfandiarpoor et al., 2025) only contain three and five environments, respectively, which is far from enough for training generic AI agents. Most existing synthetic research on agents focuses on task synthesis (Wang et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2025; Patil et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2026) and trajectory collection (Xu et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2025a; Song et al., 2024) rather than environment synthesis. Another line of research simulates the tool response or even the environment, where each state transition is generated by LLMs (Liu et al., 2024b; Lu et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025b;c; Chen et al., 2025). However, this approach is not reliable or efficient due to the hallucination issue (Wang et al., 2024; Kalai et al., 2025) and LLMs high inference cost. These limitations highlight missing piece: scalable environment synthesis. In particular, The challenge is to synInfinity Synthetic Environments for Agentic Reinforcement Learning thesize executable, reliable environments at scale, enabling replicable agent interaction and learning. In recent months, DeepSeek-V3.2 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) introduces synthesis pipeline to create thousands of executable environments for general agents, while Qwen Tongyi (Fang et al., 2025) also describes an environment synthesis pipeline but for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) rather than RL training. The adopted code-based approach is promising to build such environments at scale, since it can control the state transition and ensure the consistency of the environment. However, neither of them releases the generation pipeline nor opensources their environments. Several concurrent community efforts (Feng et al., 2025; Sullivan et al., 2025; Cai et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a; Song et al., 2026) explore environment synthesis through programming. However, they either target game-like environments, rely on human priors (e.g., code documentation), lack strong guarantees of state consistency, or remain limited in scale. To address this, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), an open-source pipeline that synthesizes executable tooluse environments at scale. The key insight is that agent environments share common structure: stateful backend, tools interface layer, and task-specific success criteria. By decomposing synthesis into these three components, we can leverage LLMs to generate each part systematically while maintaining consistency. Our AWM mirrors how software is built in practice. Starting from high-level scenario description (e.g., an online shopping platform), we first generate common user requirements (i.e., tasks) that users are likely to perform in this scenario. Then, we generate the database schema to define what entities and relations exist to fulfill these user requirements. This schema can guide the design of exposed interfaces (toolset) and help generate the backend code for the interfaces, ensuring each tool has clear data model to operate on. The interface is exposed via Model Context Protocol (MCP) (Anthropic, 2024) for unified agent tool interaction with the environment. Finally, we generate verification code that compares the database state before and after agent execution, which augments an LLM-as-a-Judge to provide robust reward signals for RL training. Critically, each stage includes automated execution and simple self-correction: if generated code fails to run, we feed the error informati"

We show that under GRPO-style optimization, global normalization baseline may deviate from diverse agents reward distributions, which ultimately leads to gradient-norm instability. Based on this finding, we propose Dr. MAS, simple and stable RL training recipe for multi-agent LLM systems. Dr. MAS uses an agent-wise remedy: normalizing advantages per agent using each agents own reward statistics, which calibrates gradient scales and dramatically stabilizes training, both theoretically and empirically. Beyond the algorithm, Dr. MAS provides an end-to-end RL training framework for multi-agent LLM systems, supporting scalable orchestration, flexible per-agent LLM serving and optimization configs, and shared resource scheduling of LLM actor backends. We evaluate Dr. MAS on multi-agent math reasoning and multi-turn search benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Qwen3 series models. Dr. MAS achieves clear gains over vanilla GRPO (e.g., +5.6% avg@16 and +4.6% pass@16 on math, and +15.2% avg@16 and +13.1% pass@16 on search) while largely eliminating gradient spikes. Moreover, it remains highly effective under heterogeneous agent-model assignments while improving efficiency.

[ 1 9 3 4 9 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aHigh-quality and open datasets remain major bottleneck for text-to-image (T2I) fine-tuning. Despite rapid progress in model architectures and training pipelines, most publicly available finetuning datasets suffer from low resolution, poor textimage alignment, or limited diversity, resulting in clear performance gap between open research models and enterprise-grade models. In this work, we present Fine-T2I, large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for T2I finetuning. Fine-T2I spans 10 task combinations, 32 prompt categories, 11 visual styles, and 5 prompt templates, and combines synthetic images generated by strong modern models with carefully curated real images from professional photographers. All samples are rigorously filtered for textimage alignment, visual fidelity, and prompt quality, with over 95% of initial candidates removed. The final dataset contains over 6 million textimage pairs, around 2 TB on disk, approaching the scale of pretraining datasets while maintaining fine-tuning-level quality. Across diverse set of pretrained diffusion and autoregressive models, fine-tuning on Fine-T2I consistently improves both generation quality and instruction adherence, as validated by human evaluation, visual comparison, and automatic metrics. We release Fine-T2I under an open license to help close the data gap in T2I fine-tuning in the open community. 1. Introduction Text-to-image (T2I) generation has advanced rapidly in the most recent two years, enabling the synthesis of highly aesthetic images while faithfully adhering to diverse and com1Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, NorthCorrespondence to: Xu Ma eastern University, Boston. <ma.xu1@northeastern.edu>.

Distribution Analysis? Large Scale? Table 1. We compare our Fine-T2I with open-sourced fine-tuning datasets. High-resolution indicates the resolution of most samples is greater than 1K. More details can be found in Sec. 3. See Fig. 13 for qualitative visual comparison illustrating the data quality. Figure 1. Visual comparison across datasets. For each dataset, we randomly sample three textimage pairs (no cherry-picking) to illustrate overall dataset quality. Zoom in for details. Dataset names for each row are provided on the following page. Fine-T2I: An Open, Large-Scale, and Diverse Dataset for High-Quality T2I Fine-Tuning plex instructions. This progress has been driven by new wave of enterprise-grade generative models, including GPT Image 1.5, Nano Banana Pro (Team et al., 2025), Seedream 4.0 (Seedream et al., 2025), and Qwen-Image (Wu et al., 2025a), among others. Such achievements always stem from two complementary factors: model-centric advances in architectures (Wu et al., 2025a; Gong et al., 2025), training objectives (Liu et al., 2025a;b), and inference tricks (Ma et al., 2025a); and data-centric progress in dataset scale, curation, and quality. Together, they push the frontier of high-fidelity image generation. While both model-centric advances and data-centric progress are critical in image generation, they do not propagate equally across our open community. Model-centric advances are always accessible. Model architectures, training objectives, and inference techniques are routinely shared through publications or blogs and can be adopted by many teams. In contrast, the data-centric parts, especially carefully curated and instruction-aligned fine-tuning data, are often private and not accessible. As result, SOTA models have become increasingly concentrated in top industry groups. Even when the open community matches the model training recipes and has enough computations, the lack of comparable high-quality data can lead to persistent and potentially growing gap. As we can see, the text-to-image leaderboard 1 is dominated by enterprise-grade products. Similar to the open dissemination of model-centric techniques, the community has strong interest in open-sourcing large-scale, high-quality data for T2I training and alignment. Yet this is difficult for two reasons. First, truly high-quality fine-tuning images are extremely expensive (often $10+ per image2). Second, such images are typically restricted by licenses and cannot be legally redistributed. Consequently, while many companies open-sourced the production-grade T2I models, high-quality fine-tuning datasets are rarely made public, and academic groups have no such resource to build large-scale and high-quality fine-tuning dataset. Therefore, the open community can only rely on datasets that are comparatively small, noisy, or distribution-specific, as summarized in Table 1, which clearly bottleneck the training of practical strong models. Although these datasets established the groundwork for the field and made significant contributions, clear gap remains in both scale and quality regarding the requirements for modern T2I fine-tuning. We provide examples from each dataset in Fig. 1, with dataset names presented in the footnote 3. Please see Fig. 13 for more examples. 1https://huggingface.co/spaces/ArtificialAnalysis/Text-toImage-Leaderboard 2https://stock.adobe.com/photos 3Dataset A: LAION-art; Dataset B: Our Fine-T2I (one synthetic subset); Dataset C: JourneyDB; Dataset D: BLIP3o60k (geneval train set). To alleviate this bottleneck, we introduce Fine-T2I, largescale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for text-to-image fine-tuning. Fine-T2I is constructed to close the gap between (i) production-grade model releases and (ii) the lack of publicly available data that is both high-quality and legally licensed. Fine-T2I dataset mixes (a) synthetic data generated by strong diffusion models and (b) curated real images licensed and shared by photographers. For the synthetic portion, we build the dataset from scratch, jointly designing prompts and generating images, covering diverse styles, categories, tasks, and prompt lengths, prompt formats, etc. We further refine each prompt using fine-tuned prompt enhancer model (Wang et al., 2025b), and generate images at either fixed squar"

Large language model agents trained in synthetic environments with code-driven simulations and database-backed state transitions demonstrate superior out-of-distribution generalization compared to traditional benchmark-specific approaches.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large language model (LLM) have empowered autonomous agents to perform complex tasks that require multi-turn interactions with tools and environments. However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization. The code is available at https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/agent-world-model.

Multi-agent large language model systems face training instability in reinforcement learning due to global normalization mismatches, which is addressed by Dr. MAS through agent-specific advantage normalization and enhanced training stability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-agent LLM systems enable advanced reasoning and tool use via role specialization, yet reliable reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for such systems remains difficult. In this work, we theoretically pinpoint a key reason for training instability when extending group-based RL to multi-agent LLM systems. We show that under GRPO-style optimization, a global normalization baseline may deviate from diverse agents' reward distributions, which ultimately leads to gradient-norm instability. Based on this finding, we propose Dr. MAS, a simple and stable RL training recipe for multi-agent LLM systems. Dr. MAS uses an agent-wise remedy: normalizing advantages per agent using each agent's own reward statistics, which calibrates gradient scales and dramatically stabilizes training, both theoretically and empirically. Beyond the algorithm, Dr. MAS provides an end-to-end RL training framework for multi-agent LLM systems, supporting scalable orchestration, flexible per-agent LLM serving and optimization configs, and shared resource scheduling of LLM actor backends. We evaluate Dr. MAS on multi-agent math reasoning and multi-turn search benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Qwen3 series models. Dr. MAS achieves clear gains over vanilla GRPO (e.g., +5.6\% avg@16 and +4.6\% pass@16 on math, and +15.2\% avg@16 and +13.1\% pass@16 on search) while largely eliminating gradient spikes. Moreover, it remains highly effective under heterogeneous agent-model assignments while improving efficiency.

A large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for text-to-image fine-tuning is presented, featuring over 6 million text-image pairs with rigorous filtering for alignment and quality across multiple task combinations and visual styles.  					AI-generated summary 				 High-quality and open datasets remain a major bottleneck for text-to-image (T2I) fine-tuning. Despite rapid progress in model architectures and training pipelines, most publicly available fine-tuning datasets suffer from low resolution, poor text-image alignment, or limited diversity, resulting in a clear performance gap between open research models and enterprise-grade models. In this work, we present Fine-T2I, a large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for T2I fine-tuning. Fine-T2I spans 10 task combinations, 32 prompt categories, 11 visual styles, and 5 prompt templates, and combines synthetic images generated by strong modern models with carefully curated real images from professional photographers. All samples are rigorously filtered for text-image alignment, visual fidelity, and prompt quality, with over 95% of initial candidates removed. The final dataset contains over 6 million text-image pairs, around 2 TB on disk, approaching the scale of pretraining datasets while maintaining fine-tuning-level quality. Across a diverse set of pretrained diffusion and autoregressive models, fine-tuning on Fine-T2I consistently improves both generation quality and instruction adherence, as validated by human evaluation, visual comparison, and automatic metrics. We release Fine-T2I under an open license to help close the data gap in T2I fine-tuning in the open community.
