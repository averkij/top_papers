Physics demands that model maintain physical consistency with the laws governing the universe, task that fundamentally requires multimodal perception to ground abstract logic in reality. At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning. Our method harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which employs progressive difficulty expansion to stabilize post-training, with Agentic Augmentation, enabling iterative self-verification at inference. Evaluated on HiPhO, rigorous benchmark of 13 exams from 20242025, our flagship P1-VL-235B-A22B becomes the first open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) to secure 12 gold medals and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the open-source models. Our agent-augmented system achieves the No.2 overall rank globally, tr"

However, interactive environments remain critically scarce, and existing synthesis methods suffer from significant limitations regarding environmental diversity and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ScaleEnv, framework that constructs fully interactive environments and verifiable tasks entirely from scratch. Specifically, ScaleEnv ensures environment reliability through procedural testing, and guarantees task completeness and solvability via tool dependency graph expansion and executable action verification. By enabling agents to learn through exploration within ScaleEnv, we demonstrate significant performance improvements on unseen, multi-turn tool-use benchmarks such as τ 2-Bench and VitaBench, highlighting strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between increasing number of domains and model generalization performance, providing empirical evidence that scaling environmental diversity is critical for robust agent learning. 1. Introduction The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established foundation for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), driven largely by the success of Data Scaling *Equal contribution Work done during an internship at Meituan 1National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University 2School of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China 3Meituan, Beijing, China 4Institute of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, China 5School of Statistics, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China.

However, transforming these models from text generators into agents requires fundamental shift: agents must effectively interact with dynamic environments and iteratively refine their actions based on environment feedback (Yao et al., 2022). Achieving such capabilities calls for training LLMs within dynamic environments, equipped with executable tools to allow agents to interact and receive immediate feedback. However, constructing environments that can be used for training LLM agents presents two core challenges. The first is Realism: tools synthesized directly by LLMs are often functionally unreliable, while LLM-based simulators are prone to severe hallucinations (Liu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025). We argue that environments must be grounded in verified, executable code rather than probabilistic text generation to ensure robust feedback. The second challenge is Scalability: synthesis cannot rely on finite external documentation or manual human intervention (Cai et al., 2025). To overcome these challenges, we introduce SCALEENV, framework enabling the fully automated construction of high-fidelity, interactive environments and verifiable tasks. SCALEENV operates through two synergistic phases that ensure both code-level rigor and real-world complexity. In the first phase, the system builds the Domain Foundation by leveraging LLMs to define tool and database schemas from simple domain keywords. It employs multi-agent architecture to generate functional code for tools and databases, which is rigorously validated via Procedural Testing mechanism to guarantee error-free execution. These components are then consolidated into global Tool Dependency Graph to map logical relationships. In the second phase, we focus on Task Construction using dependency-aware expansion strategy. By sampling seed tool chains from the graph and dynamically introducing associated database states and distractor data, the system snowballs the environment state from linear paths into complex non-linear subgraphs. This process ensures the synthesized environment supports openended exploration and diverse solution paths, providing verifiable foundation for grounding natural language user intents. ScaleEnv: Scaling Environment Synthesis from Scratch for Generalist Interactive Tool-Use Agent Training SCALEENV produces complete training ecosystem comprising executable toolkits, high-fidelity environment states, and verifiable user intents. By training Qwen-3 models (Yang et al., 2025) via Zero RL on this synthesized universe, we observe substantial performance boosts on unseen Out-of-Distribution (OOD) benchmarks, including τ 2Bench (Barres et al., 2025) and VitaBench (He et al., 2025). Crucially, this evaluation is strictly OOD: the synthesized training domains are entirely disjoint from the evaluation domains, and the benchmarks present distinct data formats (e.g., policy-constrained dialogues) not encountered during training. Furthermore, we empirically characterize the impact of Environment Scaling on model generalization performance, revealing distinct curve that validates environmental diversity as critical determinant for robust generalization. Our main contributions are as follows: We propose SCALEENV, fully automated framework that synthesizes high-fidelity interactive environments from scratch. It establishes an large-grade pipeline for agentic data, circumventing the limitations of fixed environment and manual API integration. We design robust synthesis mechanism combining Procedural Testing and Graph Expansion. This approach ensures that generated environments possess rigorous codelevel verifiability while maintaining the logical complexity required for deep reasoning. We demonstrate that agents trained on SCALEENV achieve significant zero-shot generalization on unseen benchmarks. Additionally, we provide empirical evidence for the Environment Scaling Curve, establishing new paradigm for data-centric agent training. 2. Related Works 2.1. Tool Learning The field of tool learning has evolved from SFT to autonomous exploration. Early works (Schick et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Prabhakar et al., 2025) demonstrated that LLMs could master function calls through static demonstrations"

Text:"Stable Velocity: Variance Perspective on Flow Matching Donglin Yang 1 Yongxing Zhang 2 3 Xin Yu 1 Liang Hou 4 Xin Tao 4 Pengfei Wan 4 Xiaojuan Qi 1 Renjie Liao 2 3 5 Abstract While flow matching is elegant, its reliance on single-sample conditional velocities leads to highvariance training targets that destabilize optimization and slow convergence. By explicitly characterizing this variance, we identify 1) highvariance regime near the prior, where optimization is challenging, and 2) low-variance regime near the data distribution, where conditional and marginal velocities nearly coincide. Leveraging this insight, we propose Stable Velocity, unified framework that improves both training and sampling. For training, we introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM), an unbiased variancereduction objective, along with Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA), which adaptively strengthen auxiliary supervision in the low-variance regime. For inference, we show that dynamics in the low-variance regime admit closed-form simplifications, enabling Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS), finetuning-free acceleration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 256 and large pretrained text-to-image and text-to-video models, including SD3.5, Flux, Qwen-Image, and Wan2.2, demonstrate consistent improvements in training efficiency and more than 2 faster sampling within the low-variance regime without degrading sample quality.

Text:"Learning Self-Correction in VisionLanguage Models via Rollout Augmentation Yi Ding 1 Ziliang Qiu 2 Bolian Li 1 Ruqi Zhang 1 Project Page: https://dripnowhy.github.io/Octopus/ 6 2 0 2 9 ] . [ 1 3 0 5 8 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aSelf-correction is essential for solving complex reasoning problems in visionlanguage models (VLMs). However, existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to learn it, as effective self-correction behaviors emerge only rarely, making learning signals extremely sparse. To address this challenge, we propose correction-specific rollouts (Octopus), an RL rollout augmentation framework that synthesizes dense self-correction examples by recombining existing rollouts. This augmentation simultaneously improves sample efficiency due to rollout reuse and stabilizes RL optimization through balanced supervision. Furthermore, we introduce response-masking strategy that decouples self-correction from direct reasoning, avoiding signal conflicts and enabling both behaviors to be learned effectively. Building on this, we introduce Octopus-8B, reasoning VLM with controllable self-correction capability. Across 7 benchmarks, it achieves SoTA performance among open-source VLMs, outperforming the best RLVR baseline by 1.0 score while requiring only 0.72 training time per step. 1. Introduction Visionlanguage models (VLMs) with reasoning capabilities (Jaech et al., 2024; Comanici et al., 2025; Anthropic, 2024) have achieved impressive performance on complex imagetext tasks, including real-world perception (Zhang et al., 2024c), diagram interpretation (Masry et al., 2022), and mathematical reasoning (Lu et al., 2023). Alongside reasoning improvements, reinforcement learning (RL) has been observed to induce emergent behaviors such as selfcorrection over previous reasoning steps (Wang et al., 2025a; Jian et al., 2025), often referred to as an aha moment (Guo 1Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA 2School of Information Sciences, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, USA. Preprint. February 10, 2026. Figure 1. Comparison of accuracy and training efficiency across different RL methods initialized on Qwen3-8B-VL-Instruct. Octopus achieves the best average accuracy across seven benchmarks while requiring substantially less rollout time. et al., 2025). These behaviors resemble how humans tackle challenging problems, suggesting that self-correction is an important capability for strong and robust reasoning. However, current RL paradigms do not explicitly teach selfcorrection. Rewards are provided only at the outcome level, providing no direct signal for learning how to recover from errors. As result, self-correction behavior arises only implicitly, is difficult to control, and cannot be reliably triggered at inference time (Ding & Zhang, 2025). This raises central question: how can self-correction be learned as controllable behavior in VLMs using RL? Prior attempts (Wan et al., 2025) have explored encouraging self-reflection by prompting and rewarding reflective behavior during RL. While such approaches can amplify reflective tendencies, they still rely on sparse and uncontrolled emergence. Effective self-correction examples remain rare throughout training. To address this challenge, we make key observation: although VLMs rarely generate effective self-correction examples on their own, the necessary learning signals already exist in standard RL rollouts. For given input, correct and incorrect self-generated reasoning trajectories often coexist, and their contrast naturally reveals how reasoning errors can be corrected. By pairing such trajectories, effective selfcorrection samples can be synthesized explicitly without additional computational overheads. Based on this insight, we introduce correction-specific rollouts (Octopus), rollout augmentation framework for Learning Self-Correction in VisionLanguage Models via Rollout Augmentation learning self-correction in RL. Octopus reuses and recombines rollouts, which not only provides dense, explicit selfcorrection examples, but also (i) combinatorially increases training samples (creating n2 from rollouts) and (ii) balances positive and negative examples, leading to more stable policy updates. To achieve both strong self-correction and direct reasoning, we further propose response-masking strategy that decouples their training signals and avoids optimization conflicts. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We identify key challenge in teaching self-correction via RL: effective self-correction examples are extremely sparse. We show that this challenge can be addressed by exploiting contrastive signals already present in standard RL rollouts through pairing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories. We introduce Octopus, rollout augmentation framework that constructs dense, explicit self-correction examples in RL. Octopus simultaneously improves sample efficiency via rollout reuse and stabilizes optimization by balancing positive and negative examples. We propose response-masking optimization strategy that avoids conflicting training signals between selfcorrection and direct reasoning, enabling the model to effectively learn both capabilities. Our Octopus-8B model achieves SoTA performance among models of comparable size across 7 benchmarks. It outperforms the base model Qwen3-VL-8BInstruct by 9.5 average accuracy points, exceeds the official reasoning-enhanced RL version Qwen3-VL8B-Thinking by 1.2 points, and surpasses the strongest RLVR baseline, GSPO, by 1.0 average accuracy point while requiring only 0.72 training time per step. 2. Preliminaries 2.1. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains language models on tasks whose outcomes can be easily verified, such as math problems and question answering (Lambert et al., 2024). Recent studies (Yang et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025) have shown that RLVR effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of language models.

Text:"From Directions to Regions: Decomposing Activations in Language Models via Local Geometry Or Shafran 1 Shaked Ronen 1 Omri Fahn 1 Shauli Ravfogel 2 Atticus Geiger 3 Mor Geva 1 6 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 4 6 4 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aActivation decomposition methods in language models are tightly coupled to geometric assumptions on how concepts are realized in activation space. Existing approaches search for individual global directions, implicitly assuming linear separability, which overlooks concepts with nonlinear or multi-dimensional structure. In this work, we leverage Mixture of Factor Analyzers (MFA) as scalable, unsupervised alternative that models the activation space as collection of Gaussian regions with their local covariance structure. MFA decomposes activations into two compositional geometric objects: the regions centroid in activation space, and the local variation from the centroid. We train large-scale MFAs for Llama3.1-8B and Gemma-2-2B, and show they capture complex, nonlinear structures in activation space. Moreover, evaluations on localization and steering benchmarks show that MFA outperforms unsupervised baselines, is competitive with supervised localization methods, and often achieves stronger steering performance than sparse autoencoders. Together, our findings position local geometry, expressed through subspaces, as promising unit of analysis for scalable concept discovery and model control, accounting for complex structures that isolated directions fail to capture. 1. Introduction Disentangling the representations of language models (LMs) into causal interpretable units has been hallmark of interpretability research (Sharkey et al., 2025; Geiger et al., 2024; Mueller et al., 2024). growing consensus in recent years suggests global directions in activation space as candidate units, with many concepts empirically exhibiting 1Blavatnik School of Computer Science and AI, Tel Israel 2New York University, New York, Aviv University, NY, USA 3Goodfire. Correspondence to: Or Shafran <ordavids1@mail.tau.ac.il>. Preprint. February 3, 2026. Figure 1. MFA decomposes each activation into region assignment and within-region offset. Left: the region structure is modeled by Gaussian components (centroids µk), with complex concepts typically spanning multiple Gaussians here, the broader Emotions neighborhood is spanned by several interpretable Gaussians. Right: each component is equipped with low-dimensional subspace that parameterizes structured within-region variation. linear structure (Ravfogel et al., 2020; Elhage et al., 2021; Gurnee et al., 2023; Nanda et al., 2023; Park et al., 2024). Consequently, much attention has been given to developing methods that disentangle activations into combinations of global directions (Yun et al., 2021; Bricken et al., 2023; Cunningham et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2025, inter alia). However, such decomposition methods are tightly coupled to strong geometric assumptions (Hindupur et al., 2025) that overlook growing evidence of representations with more complex geometrical structures (Cai et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2022; Engels et al., 2025; Park et al., 2025; Gurnee et al., 2026). Specifically, nonlinear or multi-dimensional concepts are dispersed across many global directions with no built-in structure relating them to one another, so recovering the concept requires post hoc assumptions about which directions form single representation (Chanin et al., 2025; Engels et al., 2025). This limitation has recently driven shift toward analysis units naturally modeled as subspaces rather than as isolated global directions (Sun et al., 2025; Huang & Hahn, 2025; Tiblias et al., 2025). Yet, while recent work shows meaningful geometric structure in activation space, how to turn these insights into practical tools for decomposition and steering remains an open challenge. In this work, we tackle this challenge through localgeometry lens, building on evidence that LMs exhibit local From Directions to Regions: Decomposing Activations in Language Models via Local Geometry low-dimensional structure (Cai et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2025; Saglam et al., 2025). We propose scalable, unsupervised method that partitions the activation space into regions and, within each region, learns low-rank subspace that captures dominant modes of variation. Then, given activation is decomposed into two compositional geometric objects: region in activation space and within-region offset (see Figure 1). To formalize the decomposition, we use classical statistical methods and employ Mixtures of Factor Analyzers (MFA; Ghahramani et al., 1996), generative model that represents each region as low-rank Gaussian distribution. We apply our approach to Llama-3.1-8B (Grattafiori et al., 2024) and Gemma-2-2B (Team et al., 2024), training MFAs with 1K, 8K, and 32K components. Analyzing the discovered regions reveals two classes: narrow Gaussians that concentrate on constrained lexical pattern (e.g., the word in in varying contexts), and broad Gaussians that encompass wide thematic topics (e.g., movies or emotions). Broad Gaussians often exhibit semantic local variation, while narrow Gaussians show more syntactic variance. Yet, with larger number of components, Gaussians become narrower and their local variance differentiates based on context. Moreover, we observe that neighboring components tend to encode related semantics and, collectively, tile broader conceptual neighborhoods. These observations suggest that concepts may be realized not by single component, but by constellations of nearby Gaussians that jointly cover semantic, complex region. Next, we contrast the decomposition induced by MFA with that of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), the predominant dictionary learning method. We find that MFA yields simple decomposition in which both the assigned region and the local variation are highly interpretable. In contrast, SAEs rely on single dictionary of global directions. In our experiments we found that on average 75% of the active features were not directly interpretable from the context. Finally, we evaluate MFAs decomposition as practical tool, showing it outperforms existing disentanglement methods on localization and steering benchmarks. For localization, MFA outperforms large-scale SAEs and various supervised baselines, beating Desiderata-Based Masking (strong supervised baseline) (De Cao et al., 2020; 2022; Csordas et al., 2021; Davies et al., 2023; Chaudhary & Geiger, 2024) on 5 out of 8 task"

Physics-oriented vision-language models leverage curriculum reinforcement learning and agentic augmentation to achieve state-of-the-art scientific reasoning performance while maintaining physical consistency through multimodal perception.  					AI-generated summary 				 The transition from symbolic manipulation to science-grade reasoning represents a pivotal frontier for Large Language Models (LLMs), with physics serving as the critical test anchor for binding abstract logic to physical reality. Physics demands that a model maintain physical consistency with the laws governing the universe, a task that fundamentally requires multimodal perception to ground abstract logic in reality. At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning. Our method harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which employs progressive difficulty expansion to stabilize post-training, with Agentic Augmentation, enabling iterative self-verification at inference. Evaluated on HiPhO, a rigorous benchmark of 13 exams from 2024-2025, our flagship P1-VL-235B-A22B becomes the first open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) to secure 12 gold medals and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the open-source models. Our agent-augmented system achieves the No.2 overall rank globally, trailing only Gemini-3-Pro. Beyond physics, P1-VL demonstrates remarkable scientific reasoning capacity and generalizability, establishing significant leads over base models in STEM benchmarks. By open-sourcing P1-VL, we provide a foundational step toward general-purpose physical intelligence to better align visual perceptions with abstract physical laws for machine scientific discovery.

ScaleEnv framework generates interactive environments from scratch to improve agent generalization through diverse domain scaling and verified task completion.  					AI-generated summary 				 Training generalist agents capable of adapting to diverse scenarios requires interactive environments for self-exploration. However, interactive environments remain critically scarce, and existing synthesis methods suffer from significant limitations regarding environmental diversity and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ScaleEnv, a framework that constructs fully interactive environments and verifiable tasks entirely from scratch. Specifically, ScaleEnv ensures environment reliability through procedural testing, and guarantees task completeness and solvability via tool dependency graph expansion and executable action verification. By enabling agents to learn through exploration within ScaleEnv, we demonstrate significant performance improvements on unseen, multi-turn tool-use benchmarks such as τ^2-Bench and VitaBench, highlighting strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between increasing number of domains and model generalization performance, providing empirical evidence that scaling environmental diversity is critical for robust agent learning.

"ScaleEnv framework generates interactive environments from scratch to improve agent generalization through diverse domain scaling and verified task completion.  					AI-generated summary 				 Training generalist agents capable of adapting to diverse scenarios requires interactive environments for self-exploration. However, interactive environments remain critically scarce, and existing synthesis methods suffer from significant limitations regarding environmental diversity and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ScaleEnv, a framework that constructs fully interactive environments and verifiable tasks entirely from scratch. Specifically, ScaleEnv ensures environment reliability through procedural testing, and guarantees task completeness and solvability via tool dependency graph expansion and executable action verification. By enabling agents to learn through exploration within ScaleEnv, we demonstrate significant performance improvements on unseen, multi-turn tool-use benchmarks such as τ^2-Bench and VitaBench, highlighting strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between increasing number of domains and model generalization performance, providing empirical evidence that scaling environmental diversity is critical for robust agent learning."

Autoregressive models with diffusion loss outperform traditional diffusion models by effectively mitigating condition errors through patch denoising optimization and condition refinement using Optimal Transport theory.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent studies have explored autoregressive models for image generation, with promising results, and have combined diffusion models with autoregressive frameworks to optimize image generation via diffusion losses. In this study, we present a theoretical analysis of diffusion and autoregressive models with diffusion loss, highlighting the latter's advantages. We present a theoretical comparison of conditional diffusion and autoregressive diffusion with diffusion loss, demonstrating that patch denoising optimization in autoregressive models effectively mitigates condition errors and leads to a stable condition distribution. Our analysis also reveals that autoregressive condition generation refines the condition, causing the condition error influence to decay exponentially. In addition, we introduce a novel condition refinement approach based on Optimal Transport (OT) theory to address ``condition inconsistency''. We theoretically demonstrate that formulating condition refinement as a Wasserstein Gradient Flow ensures convergence toward the ideal condition distribution, effectively mitigating condition inconsistency. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over diffusion and autoregressive models with diffusion loss methods.

A cognitive-inspired framework for long-context language modeling uses chunk-wise compression and selective memory recall to improve efficiency and performance over traditional approaches.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in long-context processing, including quadratic computational costs, information forgetting, and the context fragmentation inherent in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We propose a cognitively inspired framework for efficient long-context inference based on chunk-wise compression and selective memory recall, rather than processing all raw tokens. The framework segments long inputs into chunks and encodes each chunk into compressed memory representations using a learned compressor. A gating module dynamically selects relevant memory blocks, which are then iteratively processed by a reasoning module with an evolving working memory to solve downstream tasks. The compressor and reasoner are jointly optimized via end-to-end reinforcement learning, while the gating module is trained separately as a classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks such as RULER-HQA, extrapolates context length from 7K to 1.75M tokens, and offers a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared to strong long-context baselines. In particular, it achieves up to a 2 times reduction in peak GPU memory usage and a 6 times inference speedup over MemAgent.

Stable Velocity framework addresses high-variance training in flow matching by identifying low-variance regimes and proposing variance-reduction techniques for improved training efficiency and sampling speed.  					AI-generated summary 				 While flow matching is elegant, its reliance on single-sample conditional velocities leads to high-variance training targets that destabilize optimization and slow convergence. By explicitly characterizing this variance, we identify 1) a high-variance regime near the prior, where optimization is challenging, and 2) a low-variance regime near the data distribution, where conditional and marginal velocities nearly coincide. Leveraging this insight, we propose Stable Velocity, a unified framework that improves both training and sampling. For training, we introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM), an unbiased variance-reduction objective, along with Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA), which adaptively strengthen auxiliary supervision in the low-variance regime. For inference, we show that dynamics in the low-variance regime admit closed-form simplifications, enabling Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS), a finetuning-free acceleration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256times256 and large pretrained text-to-image and text-to-video models, including SD3.5, Flux, Qwen-Image, and Wan2.2, demonstrate consistent improvements in training efficiency and more than 2times faster sampling within the low-variance regime without degrading sample quality.

Octopus, an RL rollout augmentation framework, enables efficient self-correction learning in vision-language models through synthetic example generation and response masking strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Self-correction is essential for solving complex reasoning problems in vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to learn it, as effective self-correction behaviors emerge only rarely, making learning signals extremely sparse. To address this challenge, we propose correction-specific rollouts (Octopus), an RL rollout augmentation framework that synthesizes dense self-correction examples by recombining existing rollouts. This augmentation simultaneously improves sample efficiency due to rollout reuse and stabilizes RL optimization through balanced supervision. Furthermore, we introduce a response-masking strategy that decouples self-correction from direct reasoning, avoiding signal conflicts and enabling both behaviors to be learned effectively. Building on this, we introduce Octopus-8B, a reasoning VLM with controllable self-correction capability. Across 7 benchmarks, it achieves SoTA performance among open-source VLMs, outperforming the best RLVR baseline by 1.0 score while requiring only 0.72times training time per step.

Mixture of Factor Analyzers (MFA) provides a scalable, unsupervised approach for discovering complex, nonlinear structures in language model activation spaces by modeling local geometric structures through Gaussian regions and their covariance properties.  					AI-generated summary 				 Activation decomposition methods in language models are tightly coupled to geometric assumptions on how concepts are realized in activation space. Existing approaches search for individual global directions, implicitly assuming linear separability, which overlooks concepts with nonlinear or multi-dimensional structure. In this work, we leverage Mixture of Factor Analyzers (MFA) as a scalable, unsupervised alternative that models the activation space as a collection of Gaussian regions with their local covariance structure. MFA decomposes activations into two compositional geometric objects: the region's centroid in activation space, and the local variation from the centroid. We train large-scale MFAs for Llama-3.1-8B and Gemma-2-2B, and show they capture complex, nonlinear structures in activation space. Moreover, evaluations on localization and steering benchmarks show that MFA outperforms unsupervised baselines, is competitive with supervised localization methods, and often achieves stronger steering performance than sparse autoencoders. Together, our findings position local geometry, expressed through subspaces, as a promising unit of analysis for scalable concept discovery and model control, accounting for complex structures that isolated directions fail to capture.

"Mixture of Factor Analyzers (MFA) provides a scalable, unsupervised approach for discovering complex, nonlinear structures in language model activation spaces by modeling local geometric structures through Gaussian regions and their covariance properties.  					AI-generated summary 				 Activation decomposition methods in language models are tightly coupled to geometric assumptions on how concepts are realized in activation space. Existing approaches search for individual global directions, implicitly assuming linear separability, which overlooks concepts with nonlinear or multi-dimensional structure. In this work, we leverage Mixture of Factor Analyzers (MFA) as a scalable, unsupervised alternative that models the activation space as a collection of Gaussian regions with their local covariance structure. MFA decomposes activations into two compositional geometric objects: the region's centroid in activation space, and the local variation from the centroid. We train large-scale MFAs for Llama-3.1-8B and Gemma-2-2B, and show they capture complex, nonlinear structures in activation space. Moreover, evaluations on localization and steering benchmarks show that MFA outperforms unsupervised baselines, is competitive with supervised localization methods, and often achieves stronger steering performance than sparse autoencoders. Together, our findings position local geometry, expressed through subspaces, as a promising unit of analysis for scalable concept discovery and model control, accounting for complex structures that isolated directions fail to capture."

SafePred is a predictive guardrail framework for computer-using agents that uses risk prediction and decision optimization to prevent both immediate and delayed high-risk consequences in complex environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 With the widespread deployment of Computer-using Agents (CUAs) in complex real-world environments, prevalent long-term risks often lead to severe and irreversible consequences. Most existing guardrails for CUAs adopt a reactive approach, constraining agent behavior only within the current observation space. While these guardrails can prevent immediate short-term risks (e.g., clicking on a phishing link), they cannot proactively avoid long-term risks: seemingly reasonable actions can lead to high-risk consequences that emerge with a delay (e.g., cleaning logs leads to future audits being untraceable), which reactive guardrails cannot identify within the current observation space. To address these limitations, we propose a predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions. Based on this approach, we present SafePred, a predictive guardrail framework for CUAs that establishes a risk-to-decision loop to ensure safe agent behavior. SafePred supports two key abilities: (1) Short- and long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SafePred leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning. Extensive experiments show that SafePred significantly reduces high-risk behaviors, achieving over 97.6% safety performance and improving task utility by up to 21.4% compared with reactive baselines.
