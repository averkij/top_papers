Given current GUI observation and an action, Code2World predicts the next screenshot via renderable code generation. 1. Introduction Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models have revolutionized the development of autonomous GUI agents (Hong et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2025b; Qin et al., 2025). These agents are designed to perceive visual interfaces and execute sequences of actions to complete complex tasks across web and mobile platforms (Xie et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024). Despite these promising capabilities, significant gap with human proficiency persists in real-world scenarios, particularly for navigation tasks that demand precise reasoning and error correction (Chae et al., 2024). key factor contributing to human superiority is the ability to mentally simulate the consequences of actions before execution to evaluate potential outcomes and adjust their strategies accordingly. In contrast, most existing GUI agents operate actions directly without such foresight. Lacking this predictive capability, an erroneous execution at the current step often necessitates costly multi-step corrections or leads to immediate task failure (Wu et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2024). This is particularly dangerous in high-risk scenarios, such as confirming payments or deleting critical data, where actions are irreversible. To mitigate these risks, it is essential to equip agents with virtual sandbox to simulate the actionCode2World: GUI World Model via Renderable Code Generation conditioned observation, often referred to as world model which has already demonstrated remarkable success in domains like embodied AI (Lu et al., 2025b). Recent works have attempted to explore GUI world models under two different representation. Text-based approaches (Chae et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2024) leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict state transitions via abstract natural language descriptions. Although these methods capture semantic intent, they fundamentally lack visual information. Visual feedback provides more intuitive representation of the environment and has been shown to significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of agents (Su et al., 2025). Conversely, Pixel-based approaches (Wei et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2025a) predominantly utilize diffusion models to synthesize future screenshots. However, it is non-trivial to model the precise and discrete state transitions of GUIs within continuous pixel space. Such approaches also face challenges in maintaining fine-grained structural controllability, particularly in text-rich interface (Zhang et al., 2025). Ultimately, neither text nor pixel representations can simultaneously achieve high-fidelity visual simulation and precise structural controllability. Motivated by the fact that GUI is natively created by programmatic code (e.g., HTML), can we explore it as representation for learning GUI world model? Unlike abstract text or raw pixels, symbolic code inherently guarantees structural controllability while enabling high-fidelity visualization via deterministic rendering. Leveraging this insight, we propose paradigm shift by treating GUI simulation as renderable code generation. Under this paradigm, we introduce Code2World, as illustrated in Figure 1, visionlanguage coder designed to predict dynamic transitions by synthesizing structured HTML code and rendering it into the next visual state. However, realizing this paradigm presents three significant challenges: (i) Data scarcity: how to curate large-scale, high-quality data that ground diverse GUI states in faithful structured code; (ii) Screenshot-code alignment: how to build backbone and devise learning strategy that effectively align textual code generation with rendered visual reality; and (iii) Evaluation & Application: how to rigorously benchmark next UI prediction and effectively assist downstream GUI agents. To overcome these challenges, (i) we first construct AndroidCode, large-scale corpus comprising over 80K samples. Derived from the image-based GUI trajectories in AndroidControl (Li et al., 2024), we synthesize their corresponding HTML representations via GPT-5. Crucially, to ensure data quality, we implement visual-feedback revision mechanism that refines the generated code based (ii) Building on Visionon visual alignment checks.

Existing memory-based methods primarily store raw trajectories, which are often redundant and noise-heavy. This prevents agents from extracting high-level, reusable behavioral patterns that are essential for generalization. In this paper, we propose SKILLRL, framework that bridges the gap between raw experience and policy improvement through automatic skill discovery and recursive evolution. Our approach introduces an experience-based distillation mechanism to build hierarchical skill library SKILLBANK, an adaptive retrieval strategy for general and task-specific heuristics, and recursive evolution mechanism that allows the skill library to co-evolve with the agents policy during reinforcement learning. These innovations significantly reduce the token footprint while enhancing reasoning utility. Experimental results on ALFWorld, WebShop and seven search-augmented tasks demonstrate that SKILLRL achieves stateof-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines over 15.3% and maintaining robustness as task complexity increases.

Introduction Large language model (LLM) agents (Yao et al., 2022b; Shinn et al., 2023) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various sophisticated tasks, such as web navigation (Google, 2025; OpenAI, 2025c) and deep research (OpenAI, 2025b; Google, 2024; Team et al., 2025), 1UNC-Chapel Hill 2University of Chicago 3University of California San Diego 4NEC Labs America 5University of California Berkeley 6University of California Santa Cruz. Correspondence to: Peng Xia <pxia@cs.unc.edu>, Huaxiu Yao <huaxiu@cs.unc.edu>. Preprint. February 10, 2026. 1 Figure 1. (a) Overview of the SKILLRL pipeline. Unlike previous methods (gray dashed lines) that store raw trajectories and discard failures, SKILLRL employs an experience-based distillation mechanism to transform diverse experiences into structured skills. (b) Performance on ALFWorld validation set (Shridhar et al.). SKILLRL achieves faster convergence and superior success rates compared to vanilla GRPO and memory-augmented RL. by interacting with complex environments through natural language. Despite these advances, each task execution remains largely episodic. Current LLM agents operate in isolation, unable to learn from past successes or failures (Zhang et al., 2025b), which significantly hinders their evolution. Consequently, fundamental challenge remains: how can agents efficiently learn from experience and transfer that knowledge to other tasks? The existing memory-based methods for LLM agents primarily involve saving raw trajectories directly into external databases during the sampling process to serve as references for similar future tasks (Shinn et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024). While intuitive, these raw trajectories are often lengthy and contain significant redundancy and noise (Chhikara et al., 2025), making it difficult for the model to extract critical information. Recent work has attempted to compress trajectories and update the memory bank via online training (Zhang et al., 2025b; 2026), improving memory efficiency. However, these methods merely mimic past solutions and they fail to distill core principles or adapt the agents internal policy to leverage memory for guided decision-making. As depicted in the dashed flow of Figure 1(a), such approaches often struggle with the trade-off between information denSKILLRL: Evolving Agents via Recursive Skill-Augmented Reinforcement Learning sity and noise, leading to sub-optimal performance or even degradation as shown in Figure 1(b). We argue that these approaches miss crucial insight: effective experience transfer requires abstraction. Human experts do not memorize every action in every situation; instead, they develop skills (Anthropic, 2024), compact and reusable strategies that capture the essence of how to accomplish specific subtasks. Inspired by this observation, we propose SKILLRL, framework that bridges the gap between raw experience and efficient policy improvement through automatic skill discovery and recursive skill evolution. SKILLRL first introduces an experience-based skill distillation mechanism, which gathers diverse trajectories from environment rollouts and applies differential processing: successful episodes are preserved as demonstrations, while failed ones are synthesized into concise failure lessons to mitigate context noise. Secondly, we transform these experiences into hierarchical skill library SKILLBANK, differentiating between general skills for universal strategic guidance and task-specific skills for task-level heuristics. This abstraction allows the agent to adaptively retrieve relevant skills during decision-making, significantly reducing the token footprint while enhancing reasoning utility. Lastly, SKILLRL incorporates recursive skill evolution mechanism during reinforcement learning (RL), where the skill library is treated as dynamic component rather than static knowledge source. By analyzing failure modes after each validation epoch to generate new skills or refine existing ones, our approach ensures the skill library and the agents policy co-evolve, maintaining robustness as task complexity increases. As demonstrated in Figure 1(b), SKILLRL achieves substantially faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance. The primary contribution is SKILLRL, framework that enables LLM agents to bridge the gap between raw experience and policy improvement through automatic skill discovery and recursive evolution. By distilling redundant trajectories into hierarchical SKILLBANK, our method abstracts general and task-specific skills to guide decision-making efficiently. Furthermore, we introduce recursive evolution mechanism that ensures the skill library and agent policy coevolve during reinforcement learning. Empirical results on ALFWorld, WebShop, and seven search-augmented benchmarks demonstrate that SKILLRL achieves state-of-the-art performance with 15.3% improvements, significantly outperforming"

However, existing TTS methods for VLAs require additional training, verifiers, and multiple forward passes, making them impractical for deployment. Moreover, they intervene only at action decoding while keeping visual representations fixedinsufficient under perceptual ambiguity, where reconsidering how to perceive is as important as deciding what to do.

Introduction VisionLanguageAction (VLA) models map multimodal observations and language goals to actions under closedloop control, offering promising path toward generalpurpose embodied agents (Brohan et al., 2023; Zitkovich et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2024; Pertsch et al., 2025). Among these, autoregressive VLAs have emerged as predominant paradigm: they encode visual observations through vision encoder and sequentially decode action tokens conditioned *Equal contribution JC is with ECE, IPAI and ASRI in Seoul National University. 1Seoul National University.

Despite their strong generalization capabilities inherited from VLMs, the diversity of real-world environmentswhere robots encounter novel scenarios that cannot be fully anticipated during traininghas driven recent research toward enhancing VLA robustness at test time, rather than relying solely on training-time optimization (Kwok et al., 2025; Nakamoto et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025; Jang et al., 2025). prominent strategy for such test-time enhancement is TestTime Scaling (TTS) (Snell et al., 2025), which allocates additional compute at inference to improve performance. Proven 1 SCALE : Self-uncertainty Conditioned Adaptive Looking and Execution for Vision-Language-Action Models effective in LLMs (Snell et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2023) and VLMs (Chen et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2025), TTS has been recently extended to VLAs via Best-of-N selection (Gao et al., 2023) with external verifier (Kwok et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025) or self-verification (Jang et al., 2025). However, these approaches have limitations. Practically, they require additional training for verification, degrade under domain shift beyond the verifiers training distribution (Yin et al., 2025; Jang et al., 2025), and incur multiple forward passes that conflict with real-time constraints. Methodologically, existing TTS methods involve only action decoding while keeping the visual representation fixed. Yet under perceptual ambiguity (e.g., similar distractors), selecting the best action among candidates may be insufficient without reconsidering how to perceive the scene (Bajcsy, 1988; Bohg et al., 2017; Xiong et al., 2025; Qu et al., 2025). To address these limitations, we propose SCALE (Selfuncertainty Conditioned Adaptive Looking and Execution), simple inference strategy that jointly modulates visual perception and action based on self-uncertainty, requiring no additional training or external verifier, and running in single forward pass. Our approach draws inspiration from uncertainty-driven exploration in Active Inference theory (Friston et al., 2016; Schwartenbeck et al., 2019), where agents reduce uncertainty by adapting both perception and actiona principle observed in humans (Daw et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2014) and formalized in robotics as active perception (Bohg et al., 2017; Bajcsy et al., 2018). This principle naturally raises question: how can we quantify self-uncertainty to enable such adaptive modulation? Recent work in LLMs has estimated self-uncertainty by measuring how close the predicted output distribution is to uniform, i.e., full ambiguity (Kang et al., 2025). While this captures overall distributional uncertainty, it does not account for the models decisiveness about its top-1 choice, i.e., how confidently it commits to that selection. In VLAs, this decisiveness is equally important: greedy decoding, used in most VLAs (Kim et al., 2024; Qu et al., 2025), selects the top-1 action for immediate executionoften affecting the environment irreversiblymaking confidence in this selection essential for execution reliability. proper measure of self-uncertainty must therefore capture not only distributional uncertainty but also the models decisiveness about its top-1 action. To satisfy this requirement, our key idea is to measure where the predicted distribution lies between opposite ends of the certainty spectrum: full certainty (reflecting decisiveness in the top-1 action) and full ambiguity (reflecting overall distributional uncertainty), yielding measure that captures both aspects simultaneously. Specifically, inspired by log-likelihood ratio testing (Neyman & Pearson, 1933; Kullba"

Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multiround reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization (Agentic VRPO), which enhances the backbone dLLMs information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose novel agent pa"

[ 1 3 2 8 9 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Covo-Audio Technical Report Covo-Audio Technical ReportEnd-to-end large audio language models (LALMs) have emerged as promising paradigm for unifying speech processing and language intelligence, yet achieving strong semantic reasoning alongside high-quality audio interaction remains challenging. In this work, we present Covo-Audio, 7B-parameter end-to-end LALM that directly processes continuous audio inputs and generates audio outputs within single unified architecture. Through large-scale curated pretraining and targeted post-training, Covo-Audio achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance among models of comparable scale across broad spectrum of tasks, including speech-text modeling, spoken dialogue, speech understanding, audio understanding, and full-duplex voice interaction. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the pretrained foundation model exhibits strong speechtext comprehension and semantic reasoning capabilities on multiple benchmarks, outperforming representative open-source models of comparable scale. Furthermore, Covo-Audio-Chat, the dialogue-oriented variant, demonstrates strong spoken conversational abilities, including understanding, contextual reasoning, instruction following, and generating contextually appropriate and empathetic responses, validating its applicability to real-world conversational assistant scenarios. Covo-Audio-Chat-FD, the evolved full-duplex model, achieves substantially superior performance on both spoken dialogue capabilities and full-duplex interaction behaviors, demonstrating its competence in practical robustness. To mitigate the high cost of deploying end-to-end LALMs for natural conversational systems, we propose an intelligencespeaker decoupling strategy that separates dialogue intelligence from voice rendering, enabling flexible voice customization with minimal text-to-speech (TTS) data while preserving dialogue performance. Overall, our results highlight the strong potential of 7B-scale models to integrate sophisticated audio intelligence with high-level semantic reasoning, and suggest scalable path toward more capable and versatile LALMs. We will open-source Covo-Audio-Chat model and the inference pipeline soon.Speech interaction, as the most natural and efficient form of human communication, is driving artificial intelligence toward more human-like conversational systems. In this context, the ideal conversational agent must harmonize intelligence (possessing deep linguistic understanding and reasoning), naturalness (preserving paralinguistic and emotional cues), and efficiency (enabling low-latency, fluent full-duplex voice interaction). However, current approaches often force compromises among these goals. Traditional speech interaction systems predominantly rely on cascaded architectures, which combine independent modules for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Large Language Model (LLM), and Text-to-Speech (TTS). While this modular paradigm offers interpretability and controllability, it suffers from the inherent issues such as information loss and error propagation, hindering real conversational experience. Recent large audio language models (LALMs) such as Qwen2.5-Omni (Xu et al., 2025a) and Qwen3-Omni (Xu et al., 2025b) adopt the Thinker-Talker architecture, where an intermediate textual reasoning step (the Thinker) precedes acoustic token prediction (the Talker). While this improves 1 Covo-Audio Technical Report Figure 1: An Overview of Comprehensive Performance Comparison. textual intelligence preservation, it sacrifices end-to-end speech instruction following abilities and direct conversational controllability. Additionally, handling full-duplex dynamics in such sequential generation paradigm is more challenging. Human voice interaction derives its richness from dynamic blend of flexibility and diversity. End-toend LALM, aiming to map raw audio input directly to audio output within single, unified model, represents promising frontier. Pioneering works like GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024), GLM-4-Voice (Zeng et al., 2024) and Step-Audio 2 (Wu et al., 2025a) have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by augmenting LLMs with discrete audio tokens, showcasing the profound potential that enables lowlatency, contextually consistent, and emotionally empathetic interaction. Architecturally in terms of decoding text-speech tokens, end-to-end models can be categorized into generating either interleaved streams (Wu et al., 2025a; Xiaomi, 2025) or parallel streams (Ding et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025b; Team, 2025). We adopt the former as our backbone text-speech decoding design since it is more adherent to the oracle LLM philosophy. However, common pain point accompanied with this unified approach is the deep intelligence-speaker coupling problem when developing production-level application, which brings challenges in data preparation and deteriorates flexible voice customization. Building chat bot combining virtues of fascinating voice and high-intelligence is rather laborious, since it is required to gather much high-quality dialogue data for the desired speaker1. In this work, to mitigate this issue, we propose novel intelligence-speaker decoupling technique, allowing us to build conversational capabilities directly from genuine TTS data, thereby avoiding the process of constructing lots of elaborate dialogue data. Another emerging research direction is end-to-end full-duplex LALMs, which facilitate human-like interaction with low latency and complex behaviors inherent to natural conversations. Representative works are Moshi (Défossez et al., 2024) and Voila (Shi et al., 2025), which typically employ syn1Commonly, we utilize advanced TTS engines to synthesize dialogue data, which inevitably lowers the upper bound of voice expressiveness. 2 Covo-Audio Technical Report chronous dual-stream scheme, where both input and output streams are in discrete token sequences, to achieve full-duplex. However, they still require word-level text-speech alignment to generate coherent speech. OmniFlatten (Zhang et al., 2025c) adapts text LLM backbone into robust dialogue model through curated multi-stage post-training. In this work, we put full-duplex interaction, without requirements of fine-grained text-speech alignment, directly into the pre-training phase to acquire robust full-duplex conversational capabilities via large-scale pre-training. Moreover, differing from other full-duplex "

[ 1 4 4 3 8 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aParallel thinking has emerged as new paradigm for large reasoning models (LRMs) in tackling complex problems. Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning. However, most existing studies primarily focus on optimizing the aggregation phase, with limited attention to the path exploration stage. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE), which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions. 1. Introduction Despite the rapid evolution of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) (Guo et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025a), their capacity to solve complex problems in sin1National Engineering Research Center for Software Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China 2Meituan Group, Beijing, China.

Following the success of Gemini (Luong et al., 2025) in the International Mathematical Olympiad competitions, parallel thinking has emerged as promising reasoning paradigm for addressing such challenges. Parallel thinking allows the model to concurrently explore multiple potential solution paths, subsequently aggregating the outcomes of these explorations to synthesize the final answer. Such paradigm encourages the model to broadly search for potential correct trajectories within the solution space, while simultaneously mitigating the risk of biased outcomes associated with single exploration trajectory (Pan et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025b). Prior approaches rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) over extensive corpus of high-quality parallel reasoning trajectories (Wen et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025b; Ning et al., 2023). This process not only incurs heavy resource consumption for trajectory synthesis but also risks superficial pattern imitation, thereby limiting effectiveness on challenging tasks. Consequently, recent studies have shifted toward utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) to empower models to autonomously acquire parallel thinking under practical problem-solving scenarios (Zheng et al., 2025b). However, the application of RL in parallel thinking remains underexplored, with existing works predominantly concentrating on the aggregation phase over the exploration phase. Crucially, prior studies indicate that the effectiveness of the aggregation phase depends heavily on the quality of the paths found during exploration, which sets natural limit on overall performance of parallel thinking (Wang et al., 2025). In this paper, we investigate the impact of the path exploration stage on the performance of parallel thinking. We present theoretical analysis within the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and reveal that overall performance is fundamentally constrained by mutual information saturation among explored paths. Specifically, under the naive parallel thinking paradigm where paths are sampled independently, optimizing the information gain between trajectories becomes challenging. In addition, since LRMs tend to suffer from mode collapse, the generated paths often exhibit high redundancy (Shumailov et al., 2023; Shao et al., 2024). Consequently, when tackling complex OPE: Overcoming Information Saturation in Parallel Thinking via Outline-Guided Path Exploration problems, multiple parallel paths often converge on the same incorrect answers rather than covering diverse regions of the solution space. Based on these findings, we propose Outline-guided Parallel Exploration (OPE), framework that requires the model to explicitly partition the solution space using outlines before path reasoning, thereby maximizing the mutual information between generated paths and the correct solution. We start from cold-start stage to instill outline planning capabilities, where the model learns to analyze problems and generate outlines for diverse reasoning strategies. Building on this, we introduce an iterative RL strategy to jointly optimize outline planning and outlineguided reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we first conduct Outline Planning RL to encourage the model to generate diverse outlines that define multiple distinct problem-solving directions. This is followed by Path Reasoning RL, which refines the models ability to execute reasoning steps under the guidance of these outlines. These two training phases are interleaved at fixed step intervals to facilitate the synergistic evolution of both capabilities. Experimental results across serveral mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that OPE leads to significant improvements in parallel thinking performance, with particularly substantial gains on the most challenging tasks. Furthermore, comparative analysis shows that, compared to naive parallel thinking which samples each path independently, OPE exhibits superior scaling properties at test time and alleviates the issue of overthinking during path reasoning, enabling the model to reach solutions more efficiently through targeted exploration. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as: We provide theoretical perspective on parallel thinking RL, and formally identify mutual information saturation during the exploration phase as the fundamental bottleneck limiting performance.

Readers can click and play the video clips in this figure using Adobe Acrobat.1. Introduction Scaling action-controllable world models is limited by the scarcity of action labels. While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as shared reference. We introduce Seq-REPA, sequence-level controleffect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method learns more structured latent action space, leading to stronger zero-shot action transfer and more data-efficient adaptation to new control interfaces than state-ofthe-art baselines. 1Show Lab, National University of Singapore 2CFAR & IHPC, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore. Correspondence to: Mike Zheng Shou <mike.zheng.shou@gmail.com>. 1 World models (Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018; Hafner et al., 2023; Parker-Holder et al.; Garrido et al., 2024; World Labs, 2025) that predict future observations under actions are essential for planning and interactive simulation. Recent video generative models (Brooks et al., 2024; Wan et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025a; Kong et al., 2024; Peng et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2025b; Teng et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025c; Gu et al., 2025) contain rich priors about visual and physical dynamics from internet-scale data, making them promising backbones for video world modeling. However, turning such models into action-controllable simulators still typically requires large-scale, frame-aligned action labels, which is costly and often tied to specific domain or control interface (He et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025a; Team et al., 2026). Latent action learning (Edwards et al., 2019; Rybkin et al., 2019; Schmidt & Jiang, 2024; Ye et al., 2025) offers scalable solution by discovering an action space directly from unlabeled videos: an inverse-dynamics encoder infers latent actions zi from observed transitions (xi, xi+1), and forward model predicts future frames conditioned on past frames and inferred actions. Yet learning transferable latent actions remains challenging. Actions are considered transferable if they preserve control semantics across contexts: transitions corresponding to the same underlying action should produce similar zi even when the visual context (appearance, viewpoint, layout, lighting, etc. ) varies. Orienting Latent Actions for Video World Modeling Figure 2. Latent action learning. Problem: transition-based latent action models (LAMs) can reconstruct well, but fail to transfer (the same semantic action, e.g., Forward, maps to different latent directions across contexts). Cause: the latent space is identified only up to clip-specific basis, so there is no shared coordinate system. Solution: Seq-REPA uses the observable effect direction from frozen video encoder as shared reference and aligns latent actions to it, yielding consistent action semantics across contexts. We identify two failure modes. First, inverse dynamics encoders often suffer from shortcut learning (Yang et al., 2025; Garrido et al., 2026): zi may rely on context-dependent visual cues rather than the underlying controllable cause, entangling the learned actions with scene appearance. Second, and more fundamentally, local reconstruction objectives are non-identifiable across contexts (Locatello et al., 2019; Khemakhem et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023). Because training is isolated to individual clips, the model is not encouraged to use shared latent coordinate system across contexts, so the same semantic action (e.g., move forward) can correspond to different latent directions in different environments (see Figure 2, Left). Together, these issues prevent shared control interface from emerging: identical action semantics need not map to consistent region of latent space, undermining transfer and downstream controllability. To address these, we propose Seq-REPA, sequencelevel objective that regularizes the latent space via controleffect alignment. Our key insight is that while explicit action labels are unavailable, the semantic effect of control is observable in video: transitions driven by similar underlying actions should induce similar semantic change across contexts, despite appearance differences. We formalize this by leveraging frozen, self-supervised video encoder (Tong et al., 2022; Assran et al., 2025) to define target effect direction based on the net semantic change of short clip (see Figure 2, Right). Crucially, temporal feature differences naturally suppress spatial details and emphasize dynamics, making the reference stable under context shifts. Seq-REPA then aligns the integrated latent action inferred over the same window to this effect direction. This provides shared global reference that encourages consistent action meanings across contexts and discourages reliance on context-specific visual shortcuts. Using the latent actions learned with Seq-REPA as consistent control interface, we present Olaf-World, pipeline for pretraining action-conditioned video world models on large-scale passive video. Thanks to the structural alignment of our representation, it fundamentally improves the capabilities of the downstream world model (see Figure 1): (i) Context-invariant zero-shot action transfer: latent actions extracted from demonstrations in one context can be reused to induce similar control e"

[ 1 4 2 0 9 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aThis paper challenges the dominance of continuous pipelines in visual generation. We systematically investigate the performance gap between discrete and continuous methods. Contrary to the belief that discrete tokenizers are intrinsically inferior, we demonstrate that the disparity arises primarily from the total number of bits allocated in the latent space (i.e., the compression ratio). We show that scaling up the codebook size effectively bridges this gap, allowing discrete tokenizers to match or surpass their continuous counterparts. However, existing discrete generation methods struggle to capitalize on this insight, suffering from performance degradation or prohibitive training costs with scaled codebook. To address this, we propose masked Bit AutoRegressive modeling (BAR), scalable framework that supports arbitrary codebook sizes. By equipping an autoregressive transformer with masked bit modeling head, BAR predicts discrete tokens through progressively generating their constituent bits. BAR achieves new state-of-theart gFID of 0.99 on ImageNet-256, outperforming leading methods across both continuous and discrete paradigms, while significantly reducing sampling costs and converging faster than prior continuous approaches. Project page is available at https://bar-gen.github.io/ 1. Introduction Visual generative models have driven remarkable progress across wide range of computer vision tasks (Wang et al., 2023; Team, 2024; Cui et al., 2025; Deng et al., 2025; Wiedemer et al., 2025; Agarwal et al., 2025). central component of these systems is visual tokenization, which compresses high-dimensional pixel inputs into compact latent representations. Operating on these latent tokens, generative model learns the underlying image distribution to synthesize 1Amazon FAR (Frontier AI & Robotics) 2Work done while at FAR. *: Equal advising.

The proposed BAR achieves superior quality-cost trade-off (generation FID vs. throughput) on ImageNet-256. high-fidelity visual content. Depending on quantization and regularization strategies, visual tokenization and generation pipelines can be broadly categorized into discrete and continuous approaches. Each paradigm offers distinct advantages: discrete tokenizers align naturally with language modeling, making them suitable for native multimodal large language models (Team, 2024; Cui et al., 2025), whereas continuous tokenizers excel at modeling raw visual signals and preserving fine-grained details. Despite progress in both directions, continuous tokenizers, typically with diffusion models, remain dominant in visual generation (Rombach et al., 2022; Peebles & Xie, 2023; Li et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2025b). This dominance is largely attributed to their higher information capacity, which enables superior reconstruction fidelity and higher ceiling for generation (Li et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025b). In this work, we investigate the performance gap between discrete and continuous pipelines. Our key observation is that this gap is not intrinsically caused by the nature of the representations, but is instead largely associated with differences in the compression rates used in practice. To make this comparison explicit, we unify both paradigms under common metric: the number of bits used to represent the latent space. From this unified perspective, we find that the commonly observed inferior performance of discrete tokenizers is largely attributable to their substantially higher compression ratios, which lead to severe information loss. Empirically, we show that allocating more bits per token (equivalent to scaling up the codebook size) allows discrete tokenizers to match, and in some cases surpass, their continAutoregressive Image Generation with Masked Bit Modeling ple visual inputs along spatial dimensions while expanding channel dimensions, thereby providing more compact and structured representation space that is well suited for diffusion-based generation. While large body of work has focused on diffusion model architectures (Peebles & Xie, 2023; Bao et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025a), denoising trajectories (Lipman et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025), and prediction objectives (Li et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2024; 2025; He et al., 2025), SD-VAE (Rombach et al., 2022) has remained the de facto standard VAE backbone in most studies. More recently, increasing attention has been paid to enriching the semantic content of VAE latent spaces, either by incorporating off-the-shelf models (Yao et al., 2025) or by using frozen encoders as tokenizers (Zheng et al., 2025b). There are also works (Hoogeboom et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025; Li & He, 2025) that explore tokenizer-free diffusion models operating in pixel space. Discrete Visual Tokenization and Generation. Building on the foundation of VQGAN (Esser et al., 2021), substantial body of work has focused on quantizer, the core component of discrete pipelines. One stream of research aims to enhance the utilization and training dynamics of vanilla vector quantization with learnable codebooks (Yu et al., 2022; Zheng & Vedaldi, 2023; Zhu et al., 2024). Conversely, other approaches abandon learnable codebooks entirely in favor of lookup-free quantizers (Mentzer et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024a; Zhao et al., 2025). Notably, while these approaches tokenize images into bit tokens, they primarily emphasize the benefits of lookup-free quantization, and do not exploit this bit-level structure to redefine the generation targets. Among these studies, the most closely related works are MaskBit (Weber et al., 2024) and Infinity (Han et al., 2025). MaskBit (Weber et al., 2024) adopts LFQ (Yu et al., 2024a) as the tokenizer and directly feeds bit tokens into the generator. However, it still predicts codebook indices rather than bits during generation, which limits scalability with respect to codebook size, similar to standard discrete generative models. Infinity (Han et al., 2025) scales to extremely large codebook sizes (264) using BSQ (Zhao et al., 2025) and directly generates images from bits. Nevertheless, it relies heavily on the VAR generator (Tian et al., 2024) and an external bit-corrector as post-processing module. In contrast, the proposed BAR fra"

We introduce VLA-JEPA, JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is leakage-free state prediction: target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes.

Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), lightweight variance-reduction principle that instead couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver.

Introduction Continuous-time generative models have become popular framework for high-fidelity image synthesis, encompassing both diffusion models (DMs) and deterministic continuous normalizing flows (NFs). DMs have achieved state-of-theart performance across wide range of benchmarks, benefiting from stable training objectives and well-understood stochastic dynamics (Ho et al., 2020; Rombach et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023), but are often at the cost of long sampling 1William & Mary. <jdw@wm.edu>. Correspondence to: Jindong Wang Preprint. February 6, 2026. 1 Figure 1. Sample quality vs. sampling efficiency. Frechet Inception Distance (FID ) versus number of function evaluations (NFE, log scale) on CIFAR-10. Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC) consistently shifts the qualityefficiency frontier by suppressing temporal oscillations in the learned vector field, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost without modifying the underlying model or solver. trajectories and substantial computational overhead. In parallel, recent work has revisited deterministic formulations based on ordinary differential equations, demonstrating that carefully designed probability pathssuch as those used in flow matching (FM) (Lipman et al., 2023) and rectified flow (Liu et al., 2023)can offer greater flexibility and improved sampling efficiency while retaining competitive generation quality (Li et al., 2023). Despite recent progress, existing flow-matchingbased generative models still exhibit important limitations in how temporal dynamics are learned. Standard flow matching trains the velocity field as function of state and time, but does so independently at each time step, without explicitly constraining predictions across nearby times (Lipman et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). Intuitively, this independence wastes temporal correlation already present along each probability path: gradients at different timesteps share randomness but are treated as independent noise, inflating estimator variance (Boffi et al., 2025; Albergo & Vanden-Eijnden, 2023). Prior work has observed that this lack of temporal coherence induces curved trajectories in the marginal flow, which in turn lead to elevated gradient variance during training, as we also empirically observe (Figure 3), and Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2026 increased numerical error when coarse time discretizations are used at inference (Geng et al., 2025; Lee et al., 2025; Reu et al., 2025). In practice, this manifests as reduced sample efficiency: achieving high-quality samples requires finer discretization or larger number of function evaluations, even when using identical solvers and probability paths (Esser et al., 2024). Figure 1 provides direct manifestation of this effect: when the vector field is learned independently across time (FM, RF), identical sampling budgets yield substantially worse sample quality, whereas temporal pair consistency achieves markedly lower FID at the same number of function evaluations. In this work, we introduce Temporal Pair Consistency Flow Matching (TPC-FM), variance-reduced formulation of flow matching that explicitly enforces temporal coherence in the learned velocity field. Prior work on continuoustime generative models has explored temporal regularization through path-length penalties, Jacobian constraints, straighttrajectory objectives, or solverand architecture-level design choices to improve stability and efficiency (Grathwohl et al., 2019a; Kidger, 2022; Liu et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2025; Geng et al., 2025). While effective, these approaches typically modify the function class, probability path, or inference procedure. TPC instead exploits structural property of standard flow matching (Lipman et al., 2023): during training, velocity predictions at different timesteps along the same probability path are learned independently, despite being strongly correlated by construction. Directly enforcing temporal smoothness is nontrivial in this setting, since the target velocity field is defined only implicitly through stochastic path samples rather than an explicit time-continuous objective (Albergo & Vanden-Eijnden, 2023; Boffi et al., 2025). We show that this independence can be addressed by pairing timesteps sampled along the same path and encouraging consistency between their corresponding velocity predictions, yielding lightweight, self-supervised regularization that operates entirely within the existing flowmatching objective. By coupling stochastic evaluations across timewithout altering the probability path, neural architecture, or solverTPC stabilizes optimization, substantially reduces training-time variance, and improves sample efficiency in practice, complementing recent advances in probability-path design and high-resolution flow-based generation (Esser et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2025; Zhai et al., 2025). TPC-FM supports both simple and adaptive mechanisms for constructing temporal pairs. We show in Figure 3 that fixed antithetic pairing strategy, which symmetrically couples early and late timesteps along the probability path, al"

Code2World enables autonomous GUI agents to predict next visual states through renderable code generation, achieving high visual fidelity and structural controllability while improving navigation performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autonomous GUI agents interact with environments by perceiving interfaces and executing actions. As a virtual sandbox, the GUI World model empowers agents with human-like foresight by enabling action-conditioned prediction. However, existing text- and pixel-based approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural controllability. To this end, we propose Code2World, a vision-language coder that simulates the next visual state via renderable code generation. Specifically, to address the data scarcity problem, we construct AndroidCode by translating GUI trajectories into high-fidelity HTML and refining synthesized code through a visual-feedback revision mechanism, yielding a corpus of over 80K high-quality screen-action pairs. To adapt existing VLMs into code prediction, we first perform SFT as a cold start for format layout following, then further apply Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning which uses rendered outcome as the reward signal by enforcing visual semantic fidelity and action consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Code2World-8B achieves the top-performing next UI prediction, rivaling the competitive GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro-Image. Notably, Code2World significantly enhances downstream navigation success rates in a flexible manner, boosting Gemini-2.5-Flash by +9.5% on AndroidWorld navigation.

UI-Venus-1.5 is a unified GUI agent with improved performance through mid-training stages, online reinforcement learning, and model merging techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 GUI agents have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating interactions in digital environments, yet achieving both broad generality and consistently strong task performance remains challenging.In this report, we present UI-Venus-1.5, a unified, end-to-end GUI Agent designed for robust real-world applications.The proposed model family comprises two dense variants (2B and 8B) and one mixture-of-experts variant (30B-A3B) to meet various downstream application scenarios.Compared to our previous version, UI-Venus-1.5 introduces three key technical advances: (1) a comprehensive Mid-Training stage leveraging 10 billion tokens across 30+ datasets to establish foundational GUI semantics; (2) Online Reinforcement Learning with full-trajectory rollouts, aligning training objectives with long-horizon, dynamic navigation in large-scale environments; and (3) a single unified GUI Agent constructed via Model Merging, which synthesizes domain-specific models (grounding, web, and mobile) into one cohesive checkpoint. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UI-Venus-1.5 establishes new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot-Pro (69.6%), VenusBench-GD (75.0%), and AndroidWorld (77.6%), significantly outperforming previous strong baselines. In addition, UI-Venus-1.5 demonstrates robust navigation capabilities across a variety of Chinese mobile apps, effectively executing user instructions in real-world scenarios.

AI-generated summary 				 GUI agents have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating interactions in digital environments, yet achieving both broad generality and consistently strong task performance remains challenging.In this report, we present UI-Venus-1.5, a unified, end-to-end GUI Agent designed for robust real-world applications.The proposed model family comprises two dense variants (2B and 8B) and one mixture-of-experts variant (30B-A3B) to meet various downstream application scenarios.Compared to our previous version, UI-Venus-1.5 introduces three key technical advances: (1) a comprehensive Mid-Training stage leveraging 10 billion tokens across 30+ datasets to establish foundational GUI semantics; (2) Online Reinforcement Learning with full-trajectory rollouts, aligning training objectives with long-horizon, dynamic navigation in large-scale environments; and (3) a single unified GUI Agent constructed via Model Merging, which synthesizes domain-specific models (grounding, web, and mobile) into one cohesive checkpoint.

SkillRL enables LLM agents to improve through hierarchical skill discovery and recursive policy evolution, achieving superior performance on complex tasks while reducing computational overhead.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown stunning results in complex tasks, yet they often operate in isolation, failing to learn from past experiences. Existing memory-based methods primarily store raw trajectories, which are often redundant and noise-heavy. This prevents agents from extracting high-level, reusable behavioral patterns that are essential for generalization. In this paper, we propose SkillRL, a framework that bridges the gap between raw experience and policy improvement through automatic skill discovery and recursive evolution. Our approach introduces an experience-based distillation mechanism to build a hierarchical skill library SkillBank, an adaptive retrieval strategy for general and task-specific heuristics, and a recursive evolution mechanism that allows the skill library to co-evolve with the agent's policy during reinforcement learning. These innovations significantly reduce the token footprint while enhancing reasoning utility. Experimental results on ALFWorld, WebShop and seven search-augmented tasks demonstrate that SkillRL achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines over 15.3% and maintaining robustness as task complexity increases.

Prism addresses inefficiencies in block-sparse attention for long-context LLM pre-filling by using a spectral-aware approach that improves block selection accuracy through energy-based temperature calibration.  					AI-generated summary 				 Block-sparse attention is promising for accelerating long-context LLM pre-filling, yet identifying relevant blocks efficiently remains a bottleneck. Existing methods typically employ coarse-grained attention as a proxy for block importance estimation, but often resort to expensive token-level searching or scoring, resulting in significant selection overhead. In this work, we trace the inaccuracy of standard coarse-grained attention via mean pooling to a theoretical root cause: the interaction between mean pooling and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We prove that mean pooling acts as a low-pass filter that induces destructive interference in high-frequency dimensions, effectively creating a "blind spot" for local positional information (e.g., slash patterns). To address this, we introduce Prism, a training-free spectral-aware approach that decomposes block selection into high-frequency and low-frequency branches. By applying energy-based temperature calibration, Prism restores the attenuated positional signals directly from pooled representations, enabling block importance estimation using purely block-level operations, thereby improving efficiency. Extensive evaluations confirm that Prism maintains accuracy parity with full attention while delivering up to 5.1times speedup.

Agent Banana addresses challenges in instruction-based image editing through a hierarchical framework with context folding and image layer decomposition for high-fidelity, multi-turn editing at ultra-high resolution.  					AI-generated summary 				 We study instruction-based image editing under professional workflows and identify three persistent challenges: (i) editors often over-edit, modifying content beyond the user's intent; (ii) existing models are largely single-turn, while multi-turn edits can alter object faithfulness; and (iii) evaluation at around 1K resolution is misaligned with real workflows that often operate on ultra high-definition images (e.g., 4K). We propose Agent Banana, a hierarchical agentic planner-executor framework for high-fidelity, object-aware, deliberative editing. Agent Banana introduces two key mechanisms: (1) Context Folding, which compresses long interaction histories into structured memory for stable long-horizon control; and (2) Image Layer Decomposition, which performs localized layer-based edits to preserve non-target regions while enabling native-resolution outputs. To support rigorous evaluation, we build HDD-Bench, a high-definition, dialogue-based benchmark featuring verifiable stepwise targets and native 4K images (11.8M pixels) for diagnosing long-horizon failures. On HDD-Bench, Agent Banana achieves the best multi-turn consistency and background fidelity (e.g., IC 0.871, SSIM-OM 0.84, LPIPS-OM 0.12) while remaining competitive on instruction following, and also attains strong performance on standard single-turn editing benchmarks. We hope this work advances reliable, professional-grade agentic image editing and its integration into real workflows.

SCALE is a novel inference strategy for Vision-Language-Action models that jointly modulates visual perception and action based on self-uncertainty, improving robustness without additional training or multiple forward passes.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for general-purpose robotic control, with test-time scaling (TTS) gaining attention to enhance robustness beyond training. However, existing TTS methods for VLAs require additional training, verifiers, and multiple forward passes, making them impractical for deployment. Moreover, they intervene only at action decoding while keeping visual representations fixed-insufficient under perceptual ambiguity, where reconsidering how to perceive is as important as deciding what to do. To address these limitations, we propose SCALE, a simple inference strategy that jointly modulates visual perception and action based on 'self-uncertainty', inspired by uncertainty-driven exploration in Active Inference theory-requiring no additional training, no verifier, and only a single forward pass. SCALE broadens exploration in both perception and action under high uncertainty, while focusing on exploitation when confident-enabling adaptive execution across varying conditions. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SCALE improves state-of-the-art VLAs and outperforms existing TTS methods while maintaining single-pass efficiency.

A novel training-free framework called Chain of Mindset enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration for large language models by integrating spatial, convergent, divergent, and algorithmic reasoning approaches.  					AI-generated summary 				 Human problem-solving is never the repetition of a single mindset, by which we mean a distinct mode of cognitive processing. When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\% and 4.72\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/chain-of-mindset{https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/chain-of-mindset}.

"A novel training-free framework called Chain of Mindset enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration for large language models by integrating spatial, convergent, divergent, and algorithmic reasoning approaches.  					AI-generated summary 				 Human problem-solving is never the repetition of a single mindset, by which we mean a distinct mode of cognitive processing. When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\% and 4.72\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/chain-of-mindset{https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/chain-of-mindset}."

Diffusion Large Language Models are optimized for search agents through enhanced reasoning capabilities and reduced latency via a parallel reasoning paradigm.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have demonstrated unique efficiency advantages, enabled by their inherently parallel decoding mechanism and flexible generation paradigm. Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

This work presents VideoWorld 2, which extends VideoWorld and offers the first investigation into learning transferable knowledge directly from raw real-world videos. At its core, VideoWorld 2 introduces a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM) that decouples action dynamics from visual appearance: a pretrained video diffusion model handles visual appearance modeling, enabling the dLDM to learn latent codes that focus on compact and meaningful task-related dynamics. These latent codes are then modeled autoregressively to learn task policies and support long-horizon reasoning. We evaluate VideoWorld 2 on challenging real-world handcraft making tasks, where prior video generation and latent-dynamics models struggle to operate reliably. Remarkably, VideoWorld 2 achieves up to 70% improvement in task success rate and produces coherent long execution videos. In robotics, we show that VideoWorld 2 can acquire effective manipulation knowledge from the Open-X dataset, which substantially improves task performance on CALVIN.

BagelVLA is a unified Vision-Language-Action model that integrates linguistic planning, visual forecasting, and action generation through residual flow guidance for improved manipulation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Equipping embodied agents with the ability to reason about tasks, foresee physical outcomes, and generate precise actions is essential for general-purpose manipulation. While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained foundation models, they typically focus on either linguistic planning or visual forecasting in isolation. These methods rarely integrate both capabilities simultaneously to guide action generation, leading to suboptimal performance in complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose BagelVLA, a unified model that integrates linguistic planning, visual forecasting, and action generation within a single framework. Initialized from a pretrained unified understanding and generative model, BagelVLA is trained to interleave textual reasoning and visual prediction directly into the action execution loop.

"BagelVLA is a unified Vision-Language-Action model that integrates linguistic planning, visual forecasting, and action generation through residual flow guidance for improved manipulation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Equipping embodied agents with the ability to reason about tasks, foresee physical outcomes, and generate precise actions is essential for general-purpose manipulation. While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained foundation models, they typically focus on either linguistic planning or visual forecasting in isolation. These methods rarely integrate both capabilities simultaneously to guide action generation, leading to suboptimal performance in complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose BagelVLA, a unified model that integrates linguistic planning, visual forecasting, and action generation within a single framework. Initialized from a pretrained unified understanding and generative model, BagelVLA is trained to interleave textual reasoning and visual prediction directly into the action execution loop.

A trajectory expansion framework called Anchor bootstraps scalable desktop supervision from seed demonstrations by identifying branch points and generating new trajectories through state-grounded task variants.  					AI-generated summary 				 End-to-end GUI agents for real desktop environments require large amounts of high-quality interaction data, yet collecting human demonstrations is expensive and existing synthetic pipelines often suffer from limited task diversity or noisy, goal-drifting trajectories. We present a trajectory expansion framework Anchor that bootstraps scalable desktop supervision from a small set of verified seed demonstrations. Starting from each seed, we identify branch points that correspond to meaningful state changes and propose new, state-grounded task variants conditioned on the current GUI context. An executing agent then follows the proposed instructions to generate new trajectories, while a verifier enforces task completion via state-aware checks and trajectory-level consistency. To improve supervision quality, we further apply task-conditioned step-level filtering to remove ungrounded actions and denoise post-branch segments to maintain coherent intent. Experiments on standard desktop benchmarks, OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, show that models fine-tuned on our expanded corpus achieve consistent improvements over zero-shot agents and representative synthesis baselines, and generalize across applications and operating systems.

Covo-Audio is a 7B-parameter end-to-end large audio language model that processes continuous audio inputs and generates audio outputs, achieving state-of-the-art performance across speech-text modeling, spoken dialogue, and full-duplex voice interaction tasks through large-scale pretraining and post-training techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this work, we present Covo-Audio, a 7B-parameter end-to-end LALM that directly processes continuous audio inputs and generates audio outputs within a single unified architecture. Through large-scale curated pretraining and targeted post-training, Covo-Audio achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance among models of comparable scale across a broad spectrum of tasks, including speech-text modeling, spoken dialogue, speech understanding, audio understanding, and full-duplex voice interaction. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the pretrained foundation model exhibits strong speech-text comprehension and semantic reasoning capabilities on multiple benchmarks, outperforming representative open-source models of comparable scale. Furthermore, Covo-Audio-Chat, the dialogue-oriented variant, demonstrates strong spoken conversational abilities, including understanding, contextual reasoning, instruction following, and generating contextually appropriate and empathetic responses, validating its applicability to real-world conversational assistant scenarios. Covo-Audio-Chat-FD, the evolved full-duplex model, achieves substantially superior performance on both spoken dialogue capabilities and full-duplex interaction behaviors, demonstrating its competence in practical robustness. To mitigate the high cost of deploying end-to-end LALMs for natural conversational systems, we propose an intelligence-speaker decoupling strategy that separates dialogue intelligence from voice rendering, enabling flexible voice customization with minimal text-to-speech (TTS) data while preserving dialogue performance. Overall, our results highlight the strong potential of 7B-scale models to integrate sophisticated audio intelligence with high-level semantic reasoning, and suggest a scalable path toward more capable and versatile LALMs.

Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards is used to enhance parallel thinking in large reasoning models through outline-guided path exploration that reduces information redundancy and improves solution discovery.  					AI-generated summary 				 Parallel thinking has emerged as a new paradigm for large reasoning models (LRMs) in tackling complex problems. Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning. However, most existing studies primarily focus on optimizing the aggregation phase, with limited attention to the path exploration stage. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE), which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions.

SAGE is an agentic framework that automatically generates simulation-ready 3D environments for embodied AI by combining layout and object composition generators with evaluative critics for semantic plausibility and physical stability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Real-world data collection for embodied agents remains costly and unsafe, calling for scalable, realistic, and simulator-ready 3D environments. However, existing scene-generation systems often rely on rule-based or task-specific pipelines, yielding artifacts and physically invalid scenes. We present SAGE, an agentic framework that, given a user-specified embodied task (e.g., "pick up a bowl and place it on the table"), understands the intent and automatically generates simulation-ready environments at scale. The agent couples multiple generators for layout and object composition with critics that evaluate semantic plausibility, visual realism, and physical stability. Through iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection, it self-refines the scenes until meeting user intent and physical validity. The resulting environments are realistic, diverse, and directly deployable in modern simulators for policy training. Policies trained purely on this data exhibit clear scaling trends and generalize to unseen objects and layouts, demonstrating the promise of simulation-driven scaling for embodied AI.

Sequence-level control-effect alignment enables structured latent action space learning for zero-shot action transfer in video world models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Scaling action-controllable world models is limited by the scarcity of action labels. While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce SeqΔ-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method learns a more structured latent action space, leading to stronger zero-shot action transfer and more data-efficient adaptation to new control interfaces than state-of-the-art baselines.

Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce SeqΔ-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method learns a more structured latent action space, leading to stronger zero-shot action transfer and more data-efficient adaptation to new control interfaces than state-of-the-art baselines."

Discrete tokenizers can match or exceed continuous methods when properly scaled, and a new masked Bit AutoRegressive modeling approach achieves state-of-the-art results with reduced computational costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper challenges the dominance of continuous pipelines in visual generation. We systematically investigate the performance gap between discrete and continuous methods. Contrary to the belief that discrete tokenizers are intrinsically inferior, we demonstrate that the disparity arises primarily from the total number of bits allocated in the latent space (i.e., the compression ratio). We show that scaling up the codebook size effectively bridges this gap, allowing discrete tokenizers to match or surpass their continuous counterparts. However, existing discrete generation methods struggle to capitalize on this insight, suffering from performance degradation or prohibitive training costs with scaled codebook. To address this, we propose masked Bit AutoRegressive modeling (BAR), a scalable framework that supports arbitrary codebook sizes. By equipping an autoregressive transformer with a masked bit modeling head, BAR predicts discrete tokens through progressively generating their constituent bits. BAR achieves a new state-of-the-art gFID of 0.99 on ImageNet-256, outperforming leading methods across both continuous and discrete paradigms, while significantly reducing sampling costs and converging faster than prior continuous approaches.

Large language models exhibit varying levels of social risk across multiple dimensions, with significant differences in worst-case behavior that cannot be captured by traditional scalar evaluation metrics.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, where rare but severe failures can result in irreversible harm. However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.

VLA-JEPA is a JEPA-style pretraining framework that improves vision-language-action policy learning by using leakage-free state prediction in latent space, enhancing generalization and robustness in manipulation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies on internet-scale video is appealing, yet current latent-action objectives often learn the wrong thing: they remain anchored to pixel variation rather than action-relevant state transitions, making them vulnerable to appearance bias, nuisance motion, and information leakage. We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is leakage-free state prediction: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods.

"VLA-JEPA is a JEPA-style pretraining framework that improves vision-language-action policy learning by using leakage-free state prediction in latent space, enhancing generalization and robustness in manipulation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies on internet-scale video is appealing, yet current latent-action objectives often learn the wrong thing: they remain anchored to pixel variation rather than action-relevant state transitions, making them vulnerable to appearance bias, nuisance motion, and information leakage. We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is leakage-free state prediction: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods."

**Reasoning:**

1. **OPTIMIZATION**: The paper presents VLA-JEPA, a pretraining framework that optimizes vision-language-action policy learning through improved training objectives and methods (leakage-free state prediction, latent space prediction rather than pixel space).

2. **TRANSFER_LEARNING**: The paper focuses on pretraining on internet-scale video data and then fine-tuning for downstream manipulation tasks, which is a core transfer learning approach - knowledge learned from large-scale pretraining is transferred to specific robotic manipulation tasks.

Temporal Pair Consistency reduces variance in continuous-time generative models by coupling velocity predictions at paired timesteps, improving sample quality and efficiency without altering model architecture or training procedures.  					AI-generated summary 				 Continuous-time generative models, such as diffusion models, flow matching, and rectified flow, learn time-dependent vector fields but are typically trained with objectives that treat timesteps independently, leading to high estimator variance and inefficient sampling. Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.

  "desc": "В работе предлагается метод Temporal Pair Consistency для снижения дисперсии в непрерывных генеративных моделях, таких как диффузионные модели и flow matching. Ключевая идея заключается в связывании предсказаний скоростей в парах временных шагов вдоль одной траектории вероятности, что действует только на уровне оценщика без изменения архитектуры модели. Авторы доказывают теоретически, что TPC индуцирует квадратичную регуляризацию, связанную с траекторией, которая снижает дисперсию градиентов при сохранении исходной objective функции. Экспериментальные результаты показывают улучшение качества синтеза и эффективности на CIFAR-10 и ImageNet с более низким FID при сопоставимых или меньших вычислительных затратах.",
