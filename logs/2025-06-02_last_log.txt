Morgan AI Research, 4 Carnegie Mellon University, 5 NVIDIA https://dex-umi.github.io/ Abstract: We present DexUMI - data collection and policy learning framework that uses the human hand as the natural interface to transfer dexterous manipulation skills to various robot hands. DexUMI includes hardware and software adaptations to minimize the embodiment gap between the human hand and various robot hands. The hardware adaptation bridges the kinematics gap using wearable hand exoskeleton. It allows direct haptic feedback in manipulation data collection and adapts human motion to feasible robot hand motion. The software adaptation bridges the visual gap by replacing the human hand in video data with high-fidelity robot hand inpainting. We demonstrate DexUMIs capabilities through comprehensive real-world experiments on two different dexterous robot hand hardware platforms, achieving an average task success rate of 86%. Keywords: Dexterous Manipulation, Learning from Human, Imitation Learning Figure 1: DexUMI transfer dexterous human manipulation skills to various robot hand by using wearable exoskeletons and data processing framework. We demonstrate DexUMIs capability and effectiveness on both underactuated (e.g., Inspire) and fully-actuated (e.g., XHand) robot hand for wide variety of manipulation tasks. Please see project website https://dex-umi.github.io/ for details. Human hands are incredibly dexterous in wide range of tasks. Dexterous robot hands are designed with the hope of replicating this capability. However, it remains significant challenge to transfer skills from human hands to robotic counterparts due to their substantial embodiment gap. This gap manifests in various for"

Story visualization, which aims to generate a sequence of visually coherent images aligning with a given narrative and reference images, has seen significant progress with recent advancements in generative models. To further enhance the performance of story visualization frameworks in real-world scenarios, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, ViStoryBench. We collect a diverse dataset encompassing various story types and artistic styles, ensuring models are evaluated across multiple dimensions such as different plots (e.g., comedy, horror) and visual aesthetics (e.g., anime, 3D renderings). ViStoryBench is carefully curated to balance narrative structures and visual elements, featuring stories with single and multiple protagonists to test models' ability to maintain character consistency. Additionally, it includes complex plots and intricate world-building to challenge models in generating accurate visuals. To ensure comprehensive comparisons, our benchmark incorporates a wide range of evaluation metrics assessing critical aspects. This structured and multifaceted framework enables researchers to thoroughly identify both the strengths and weaknesses of different models, fostering targeted improvements.

The Fork-Merge Decoding strategy improves balanced multimodal understanding in audio-visual large language models by separating and then combining modality-specific reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 The goal of this work is to enhance balanced multimodal understanding in audio-visual large language models (AV-LLMs) by addressing modality bias without requiring additional training. In current AV-LLMs, audio and video features are typically processed jointly in the decoder. While this strategy facilitates unified multimodal understanding, it may introduce modality bias, where the model tends to over-rely on one modality due to imbalanced training signals. To mitigate this, we propose Fork-Merge Decoding (FMD), a simple yet effective inference-time strategy that requires no additional training or architectural modifications. FMD first performs modality-specific reasoning by processing audio-only and video-only inputs through the early decoder layers (a fork phase), and then merges the resulting hidden states for joint reasoning in the remaining layers (a merge phase). This approach promotes balanced modality contributions and leverages complementary information across modalities. We evaluate our method on two representative AV-LLMs, VideoLLaMA2 and video-SALMONN, using three benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance improvements on tasks focused on audio, video, and combined audio-visual reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of inference-time interventions for robust multimodal understanding.

DexUMI framework utilizes a wearable hand exoskeleton and high-fidelity robot hand inpainting to transfer dexterous manipulation skills from human hands to robot hands, achieving high task success rates.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present DexUMI - a data collection and policy learning framework that uses the human hand as the natural interface to transfer dexterous manipulation skills to various robot hands. DexUMI includes hardware and software adaptations to minimize the embodiment gap between the human hand and various robot hands. The hardware adaptation bridges the kinematics gap using a wearable hand exoskeleton. It allows direct haptic feedback in manipulation data collection and adapts human motion to feasible robot hand motion. The software adaptation bridges the visual gap by replacing the human hand in video data with high-fidelity robot hand inpainting. We demonstrate DexUMI's capabilities through comprehensive real-world experiments on two different dexterous robot hand hardware platforms, achieving an average task success rate of 86%.

Фреймворк включает аппаратную адаптацию в виде носимого экзоскелета руки и программную адаптацию для замены изображения человеческой руки на робототехническую в видеоданных. DexUMI позволяет минимизировать разрыв между воплощением человеческой и роботизированной руки. В экспериментах на двух различных платформах дексетрозных роботизированных рук была достигнута средняя успешность выполнения задач 86%.",

"DexUMI framework utilizes a wearable hand exoskeleton and high-fidelity robot hand inpainting to transfer dexterous manipulation skills from human hands to robot hands, achieving high task success rates.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present DexUMI - a data collection and policy learning framework that uses the human hand as the natural interface to transfer dexterous manipulation skills to various robot hands. DexUMI includes hardware and software adaptations to minimize the embodiment gap between the human hand and various robot hands. The hardware adaptation bridges the kinematics gap using a wearable hand exoskeleton.
