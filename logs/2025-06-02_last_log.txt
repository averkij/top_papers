Text:"Yihong Tang, Menglin Kong, Lijun Sun(cid:66){yihong.tang,menglin.kong}@mail.mcgill.ca, lijun.sun@mcgill.caGenerating synthetic data that faithfully captures the statistical structure of realworld distributions is fundamental challenge in data modeling. Classical approaches often depend on strong parametric assumptions or manual structural design and struggle in high-dimensional or heterogeneous domains. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) reveals their potential as flexible, high-dimensional priors over real-world distributions. However, when applied to data synthesis, standard LLM-based sampling is inefficient, constrained by fixed context limits, and fails to ensure statistical alignment. Given this, we introduce LLMSYNTHOR, general framework for data synthesis that transforms LLMs into structure-aware simulators guided by distributional feedback. LLMSYNTHOR treats the LLM as nonparametric copula simulator for modeling high-order dependencies and introduces LLM Proposal Sampling to generate grounded proposal distributions that improve sampling efficiency without requiring rejection. By minimizing discrepancies in the summary statistics space, the iterative synthesis loop aligns real and synthetic data while gradually uncovering and refining the latent generative structure. We evaluate LLMSYNTHOR in both controlled and real-world settings using heterogeneous datasets in privacy-sensitive domains (e.g., e-commerce, population, and mobility) that encompass both structured and unstructured formats. The synthetic data produced by LLMSYNTHOR shows high statistical fidelity, practical utility, and cross-data adaptability, positioning it as valuable tool across economics, social science, urban studies, and beyond.High-quality synthetic data has become an essential enabler for research, innovation, and policymaking, particularly in domains where access to real data is limited by privacy, legal, or logistical constraints [33, 6]. When statistically faithful, synthetic datasets can support meaningful analysis without compromising sensitive information. This is especially important in complex, high-dimensional domains such as human mobility, where detailed data is critical for urban planning and infrastructure design [42], yet poses serious privacy risks. For instance, privacy-preserving mobility traces can help simulate emergency scenarios while protecting individual identities. 5 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 2 5 7 4 1 . 5 0 5 2 : r Method Assumptions Manual Effort Efficiency Traditional methods for data synthesis, including parametric models and rule-based simulators, offer interpretability and control but rely on strong assumptions and often fail to scale to complex dependencies or high-dimensional data.

Under review. ularly in vision and text [38], but suffer from training instability, limited controllability, and poor generalization across formats [46]. Most existing approaches are tightly coupled to specific data types and require retraining or manual adaptation for new domains, limiting their practical utility [55]. Table 1 summarizes these trade-offs across different generative paradigms, highlighting the lack of unified, distribution-aware synthesis framework that is format-agnostic, scalable, and robust. These limitations call for an approach that unifies high-capacity generative priors with explicit statistical alignment, efficient sampling, and cross-domain applicability. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest new direction. Pretrained on diverse, large-scale corpora, LLMs exhibit strong structural priors and can generate semantically coherent data across domains in zero-shot settings [1, 21, 23]. This makes them appealing as universal priors for synthetic data generation. However, standard LLM sampling remains fundamentally limited: it lacks global distributional alignment, generates samples inefficiently and independently, and cannot produce large datasets due to context length constraints [47]. These limitations prevent LLMs from serving as reliable tools for statistically aligned synthesis. To address these challenges, we propose LLMSYNTHOR, general framework that repurposes LLMs as structure-aware simulators embedded within distribution-guided inference loop. Rather than sampling directly from the model, LLMSYNTHOR leverages summary statistics to model the LLM as nonparametric copula simulator that captures latent dependencies and supports both marginal and joint alignment. To enable cross-domain use, LLMSYNTHOR maps continuous and discrete variables into unified, type-agnostic summary space, allowing interpretable comparison of statistical structures. This ensures consistent performance across diverse data types without retraining or redesign. To increase efficiency, we introduce LLM Proposal Sampling, in which the LLM outputs structured, sampleable distributions instead of individual records. To overcome context limitations and ensure full dataset coverage, we implement an iterative refinement process that guides generation using discrepancy signals between real and synthetic data in unified summary space. This theorygrounded mechanism enables scalable, type-agnostic generation across structured and unstructured formats without retraining. LLMSYNTHOR unifies the semantic flexibility of LLMs with rigorous statistical control, enabling fine-grained, high-fidelity synthesis across domains. It supports distributional alignment, structureaware generalization, and rejection-free sampling in flexible and scalable framework. To summarize, our contributions are: We introduce LLMSYNTHOR, the first framework to leverage LLMs for high-fidelity, distributionally aligned synthetic data generation, supporting seamless adaptation across data domains. We propose unified modeling paradigm that interprets the LLM as nonparametric copula simulator, and develop LLM Proposal Sampling to enable efficient, coherent synthesis tha"

"LLMSynthor enhances LLMs for efficient and statistically accurate data synthesis through distributional feedback and proposal sampling.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generating synthetic data that faithfully captures the statistical structure of real-world distributions is a fundamental challenge in data modeling. Classical approaches often depend on strong parametric assumptions or manual structural design and struggle in high-dimensional or heterogeneous domains. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) reveals their potential as flexible, high-dimensional priors over real-world distributions. However, when applied to data synthesis, standard LLM-based sampling is inefficient, constrained by fixed context limits, and fails to ensure statistical alignment. Given this, we introduce LLMSynthor, a general framework for data synthesis that transforms LLMs into structure-aware simulators guided by distributional feedback. LLMSynthor treats the LLM as a nonparametric copula simulator for modeling high-order dependencies and introduces LLM Proposal Sampling to generate grounded proposal distributions that improve sampling efficiency without requiring rejection. By minimizing discrepancies in the summary statistics space, the iterative synthesis loop aligns real and synthetic data while gradually uncovering and refining the latent generative structure. We evaluate LLMSynthor in both controlled and real-world settings using heterogeneous datasets in privacy-sensitive domains (e.g., e-commerce, population, and mobility) that encompass both structured and unstructured formats. The synthetic data produced by LLMSynthor shows high statistical fidelity, practical utility, and cross-data adaptability, positioning it as a valuable tool across economics, social science, urban studies, and beyond."

CAPTCHAs have been a critical bottleneck for deploying web agents in real-world applications, often blocking them from completing end-to-end automation tasks. While modern multimodal LLM agents have demonstrated impressive performance in static perception tasks, their ability to handle interactive, multi-step reasoning challenges like CAPTCHAs is largely untested. To address this gap, we introduce Open CaptchaWorld, the first web-based benchmark and platform specifically designed to evaluate the visual reasoning and interaction capabilities of MLLM-powered agents through diverse and dynamic CAPTCHA puzzles. Our benchmark spans 20 modern CAPTCHA types, totaling 225 CAPTCHAs, annotated with a new metric we propose: CAPTCHA Reasoning Depth, which quantifies the number of cognitive and motor steps required to solve each puzzle. Experimental results show that humans consistently achieve near-perfect scores, state-of-the-art MLLM agents struggle significantly, with success rates at most 40.0% by Browser-Use Openai-o3, far below human-level performance, 93.3%. This highlights Open CaptchaWorld as a vital benchmark for diagnosing the limits of current multimodal agents and guiding the development of more robust multimodal reasoning systems.

Recent advances in model distillation demonstrate that data from advanced reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI's o1) can effectively transfer complex reasoning abilities to smaller, efficient student models. However, standard practices employ rejection sampling, discarding incorrect reasoning examples -- valuable, yet often underutilized data. This paper addresses the critical question: How can both positive and negative distilled reasoning traces be effectively leveraged to maximize LLM reasoning performance in an offline setting? To this end, We propose Reinforcement Distillation (REDI), a two-stage framework. Stage 1 learns from positive traces via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Stage 2 further refines the model using both positive and negative traces through our proposed REDI objective. This novel objective is a simple, reference-free loss function that outperforms established methods like DPO and SimPO in this distillation context. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate REDI's superiority over baseline Rejection Sampling SFT or SFT combined with DPO/SimPO on mathematical reasoning tasks. Notably, the Qwen-REDI-1.5B model, post-trained on just 131k positive and negative examples from the open Open-R1 dataset, achieves an 83.1% score on MATH-500 (pass@1). Its performance matches or surpasses that of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B (a model post-trained on 800k proprietary data) across various mathematical reasoning benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B models post-trained offline with openly available data.

Recently, methods leveraging diffusion model priors to assist monocular geometric estimation (e.g., depth and normal) have gained significant attention due to their strong generalization ability. However, most existing works focus on estimating geometric properties within the camera coordinate system of individual video frames, neglecting the inherent ability of diffusion models to determine inter-frame correspondence. In this work, we demonstrate that, through appropriate design and fine-tuning, the intrinsic consistency of video generation models can be effectively harnessed for consistent geometric estimation. Specifically, we 1) select geometric attributes in the global coordinate system that share the same correspondence with video frames as the prediction targets, 2) introduce a novel and efficient conditioning method by reusing positional encodings, and 3) enhance performance through joint training on multiple geometric attributes that share the same correspondence. Our results achieve superior performance in predicting global geometric attributes in videos and can be directly applied to reconstruction tasks. Even when trained solely on static video data, our approach exhibits the potential to generalize to dynamic video scenes.

"Recently, methods leveraging diffusion model priors to assist monocular geometric estimation (e.g., depth and normal) have gained significant attention due to their strong generalization ability. However, most existing works focus on estimating geometric properties within the camera coordinate system of individual video frames, neglecting the inherent ability of diffusion models to determine inter-frame correspondence. In this work, we demonstrate that, through appropriate design and fine-tuning, the intrinsic consistency of video generation models can be effectively harnessed for consistent geometric estimation. Specifically, we 1) select geometric attributes in the global coordinate system that share the same correspondence with video frames as the prediction targets, 2) introduce a novel and efficient conditioning method by reusing positional encodings, and 3) enhance performance through joint training on multiple geometric attributes that share the same correspondence. Our results achieve superior performance in predicting global geometric attributes in videos and can be directly applied to reconstruction tasks. Even when trained solely on static video data, our approach exhibits the potential to generalize to dynamic video scenes."

A comprehensive TTS benchmark, EmergentTTS-Eval, automates test-case generation and evaluation using LLMs and LALM to assess nuanced and semantically complex text in speech outputs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-Speech (TTS) benchmarks often fail to capture how well models handle nuanced and semantically complex text. Building on EmergentTTS, we introduce EmergentTTS-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark covering six challenging TTS scenarios: emotions, paralinguistics, foreign words, syntactic complexity, complex pronunciation (e.g. URLs, formulas), and questions. Crucially, our framework automates both test-case generation and evaluation, making the benchmark easily extensible. Starting from a small set of human-written seed prompts, we iteratively extend them using LLMs to target specific structural, phonetic and prosodic challenges, resulting in 1,645 diverse test cases. Moreover, we employ a model-as-a-judge approach, using a Large Audio Language Model (LALM) to assess the speech across multiple dimensions such as expressed emotion, prosodic, intonational, and pronunciation accuracy. We evaluate state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary TTS systems, such as 11Labs, Deepgram, and OpenAI's 4o-mini-TTS, on EmergentTTS-Eval, demonstrating its ability to reveal fine-grained performance differences. Results show that the model-as-a-judge approach offers robust TTS assessment and a high correlation with human preferences. We open source the evaluation https://github.com/boson-ai/EmergentTTS-Eval-public{code} and the https://huggingface.co/datasets/bosonai/EmergentTTS-Eval{dataset}.
