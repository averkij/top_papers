The gradient detach operations for components outlined in red effectively freeze the nonlinear activations for given input sequence, creating linear path for the gradient with respect to the input embedding vectors, but do not change the output. The output embedding prediction can be nearly exactly mapped to linear system by the Jacobian autograd operation. The feedforward module with SwiGLU activation function is shown in expanded form to demonstrate how the nonlinear Swish term can be detached from the gradient to form linear path, achieving local linearity for given input. The RM SN orm layers and and softmax attention blocks also must be detached from the gradient. 2023) and analytic results on generalization (Cowsik et al., 2024). While transformers are fundamentally complex globally nonlinear functions of their input, we demonstrate how to compute linear transform that is nearly exactly numerically equivalent to the forward computation for given input sequence without modifying the network weights or altering the output predictions. Our approach builds on two previous results: Elhage et al. (2021) found that attention-only networks with basic language generation abilities transfer semantic information across the network with interpretable circuits, including the induction head, and Kadkhodaie et al. (2023) showed that powerful image denoising diffusion models can be made exactly locally or piecewise linear through several architectural constraints and interpreted as low-dimensional adaptive linear filters. We extend these ideas by demonstrating nearly exact local linearity for open-weight LLMs with gated linear activations for given input sequence. For many open-weightFigure 2. An overview of next-token prediction in the Llama 3.2 3B transformer decoder and decomposition of the predicted embedding vector computation using the detached Jacobian. Generating three tokens with only < BoT > as input produces The 201. For each prediction, each input token ti is mapped to an embedding vector xi, and the network generates the embedding of next token. The phrase turns out to be The 2019-2020 season. The detached Jacobian J+(x) of the predicted output embedding with respect to the input embeddings is composed of matrix corresponding to each input vector. Each detached Jacobian matrix J+ (x) is function of the entire input sequence but operates only on its corresponding input embedding vector. The matrices tend to be extremely low rank, shown in the inset figures, and the matrix J+ 0 varies across A), B) and C) above because the input sequences differ. Since the detached Jacobian captures the entirety of the model operation in linear system (numerically, for given input sequence), tools like the SVD can be used to interpret the model and its sub-components. LLMs, the gradient operation with respect to the input can be manipulated at inference such that the output prediction is unchanged and also exactly locally linear. This numerical Jacobian computation with respect to an input sequence captures the complete forward operation of the model, including activation functions and attention, with the near exactness holding only for the same input embeddings at which the Jacobian was computed. This approach allows us to analyze entire models, from input embeddings to predicted output embedding, as equivalent linear systems for particular input sequence. By examining the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the equivalent linear system for given input, we can measure the local dimensionality of the learned manifolds involved in next-token prediction, and we can decode the singular vectors into output tokens. This analysis can also be done layer by layer, or for individual attention and multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, in order to observe how these models compose next-token predictions. We demonstrate local linearity in model families including Llama 3, Gemma 3, Qwen 3 (including Deepseek R1 0528 Qwen 3 8B), Phi 4, Mistral Ministral and OLMo 2, at range of sizes up to Llama 3.3 70B Q4. This approach does not require further model training, offering new path to interpreting wide range of open-weight LLMs at local level that could serve as complement to other powerful interpretability methods."

This paper presents AlphaOne (alpha1), a universal framework for modulating reasoning progress in large reasoning models (LRMs) at test time. alpha1 first introduces alpha moment, which represents the scaled thinking phase with a universal parameter alpha. Within this scaled pre-alpha moment phase, it dynamically schedules slow thinking transitions by modeling the insertion of reasoning transition tokens as a Bernoulli stochastic process. After the alpha moment, alpha1 deterministically terminates slow thinking with the end-of-thinking token, thereby fostering fast reasoning and efficient answer generation. This approach unifies and generalizes existing monotonic scaling methods by enabling flexible and dense slow-to-fast reasoning modulation. Extensive empirical studies on various challenging benchmarks across mathematical, coding, and scientific domains demonstrate alpha1's superior reasoning capability and efficiency.

Generating accurate multilingual text with diffusion models has long been desired but remains challenging. Recent methods have made progress in rendering text in a single language, but rendering arbitrary languages is still an unexplored area. This paper introduces EasyText, a text rendering framework based on DiT (Diffusion Transformer), which connects denoising latents with multilingual character tokens encoded as character tokens. We propose character positioning encoding and position encoding interpolation techniques to achieve controllable and precise text rendering. Additionally, we construct a large-scale synthetic text image dataset with 1 million multilingual image-text annotations as well as a high-quality dataset of 20K annotated images, which are used for pretraining and fine-tuning respectively. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and advancement of our approach in multilingual text rendering, visual quality, and layout-aware text integration.

We demonstrate that the inference operations of several open-weight large language models (LLMs) can be mapped to an exactly equivalent linear system for an input sequence without modifying the model weights or altering output predictions. Extending techniques from image diffusion models that exhibit local or piecewise linearity, we strategically alter the gradient computation with respect to a given input sequence for a next-token prediction such that the Jacobian of the model nearly exactly reproduces the forward prediction with a linear system. We demonstrate this approach across models (Llama 3, Gemma 3, Qwen 3, Phi 4, Mistral Ministral and OLMo 2, up to Llama 3.3 70B Q4) and show through the singular value decomposition of the detached Jacobian that these LLMs operate in extremely low-dimensional subspaces where many of the largest singular vectors decode to concepts related to the most-likely output token. This approach also allows us to examine the operation of each successive layer (and its attention and MLP components) as nearly-exact linear systems and observe the emergence of semantic concepts. Despite their expressive power and global nonlinearity, modern LLMs can be interpreted through nearly-exact locally linear decompositions that provide insights into their internal representations and reveal interpretable semantic structures in the next-token prediction process.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise but remain challenging to continually improve through traditional finetuning, particularly when integrating capabilities from other specialized LLMs. Popular methods like ensemble and weight merging require substantial memory and struggle to adapt to changing data environments. Recent efforts have transferred knowledge from multiple LLMs into a single target model; however, they suffer from interference and degraded performance among tasks, largely due to limited flexibility in candidate selection and training pipelines. To address these issues, we propose a framework that adaptively selects and aggregates knowledge from diverse LLMs to build a single, stronger model, avoiding the high memory overhead of ensemble and inflexible weight merging. Specifically, we design an adaptive selection network that identifies the most relevant source LLMs based on their scores, thereby reducing knowledge interference. We further propose a dynamic weighted fusion strategy that accounts for the inherent strengths of candidate LLMs, along with a feedback-driven loss function that prevents the selector from converging on a single subset of sources. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can enable a more stable and scalable knowledge aggregation process while reducing knowledge interference by up to 50% compared to existing approaches.
