Text:"CLaSp: In-Context Layer Skip for Self-Speculative Decoding Longze Chen1,2* Renke Shan2,5* Huiming Wang3* Lu Wang5 Ziqiang Liu1,2 Run Luo1,2 Jiawei Wang2 Hamid Alinejad-Rokny4 Min YangSpeculative decoding (SD) is promising method for accelerating the decoding process of Large Language Models (LLMs). The efficiency of SD primarily hinges on the consistency between the draft model and the verify model. However, existing drafting approaches typically require additional modules to be trained, which can be challenging to implement and ensure compatibility across various LLMs. In this paper, we propose CLaSp, an in-context layer-skipping strategy for selfspeculative decoding. Unlike prior methods, CLaSp does not require additional drafting modules or extra training. Instead, it employs plug-and-play mechanism by skipping intermediate layers of the verify model to construct compressed draft model. Specifically, we develop dynamic programming algorithm that optimizes the layer-skipping process by leveraging the complete hidden states from the last verification stage as an objective. This enables CLaSp to dynamically adjust its layer-skipping strategy after each verification stage, without relying on pre-optimized sets of skipped layers. Experimental results across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that CLaSp achieves speedup of 1.3 1.7 on LLaMA3 series models without altering the original distribution of the generated text. 5 2 0 2 0 3 ] . [ 1 6 9 1 4 2 . 5 0 5 2 : rTransformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across wide range of natural language processing applications (Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023). Scaling the model size and extending the context window significantly enhance performance (Kaplan et al., 2020; Anil et al., 2023; Reid et al., 2024), but also leads to rapid increase in *Equal contribution. Corresponding author. 1 Figure 1: Previous Self-SD method vs. CLaSp. Compared to the previous Self-SD method, which requires costly Bayesian optimization on training dataset to select fixed set of skipped layers, CLaSp employs dynamic layer-skipping strategy that adjusts in real-time based on context. inference latency. This latency primarily stems from the autoregressive nature of LLMs, where model parameters must be loaded into GPU SRAM for each token generation, resulting in underutilization of computational cores during the decoding stage (Patterson, 2004; Shazeer, 2019; Agrawal et al., 2023). Inspired by speculative execution in computer systems (Burton, 1985; Hennessy and Patterson, 2012), speculative decoding (SD) (Xia et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023) is proposed as lossless autoregressive decoding acceleration technique. SD accelerates autoregressive decoding by introducing an efficient draft model to pre-generate tokens, which are subsequently validated by slower verify model in parallel. This technique significantly reduces the number of forward passes required by the verify model, alleviating memory-bound inefficiencies caused by frequent parameter access. While effective, SD relies on finding or training suitable draft model that can closely mimic the behavior of the verify model. This requirement is feasible for open-sourced model families, such as LLaMA series (Touvron et al., 2023a,b; Dubey et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024), but becomes prohibitively difficult for specialized LLMs that lack pre-existing compatible draft model counterparts. The difficulty lies in achieving consistency between the draft model and the verify model. For general-purpose models, lightweight modules have been proposed as substitutes for the draft model (Cai et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024b; Du et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024). These modules are designed to avoid retraining from scratch, but they struggle to generalize across diverse tasks and contexts. As result, their acceptance rates drop sharply when handling unseen tasks, making them unsuitable for applications requiring robust performance across varying scenarios. Self-speculative decoding (Self-SD) (Zhang et al., 2024) addresses the challenge of compatibility by using parts of the verify model itself as compressed draft model, bypassing the need for additional modules or training. This approach creates the draft model by sparsifying intermediate layers of the verify model, effectively skipping certain computations. Similar to methods that require training, it also lacks robust generalization and heavily relies on an time-consuming Bayesian optimization process. SWIFT (Xia et al., 2024a) extends Self-SD by dynamically optimizing skipped layers as the number of user requests increases, but its effectiveness diminishes when handling sparse or unique task data. To bridge this gap, we propose CLaSp, dynamic in-context layer-skipping method for selfspeculative decoding. Unlike existing methods, CLaSp dynamically adjusts the skipped layer set at each decoding step based on the current context, eliminating the need for pre-optimization or retraining (see Figure 1). Our approach leverages the observation of slowly changing embeddings across layers (Liu et al., 2023) and employs dynamic programming algorithm to identify the optimal skipped layers with minimal additional latency. By using the complete hidden states from the last verification step as ground truth, CLaSp predicts and adjusts the draft models sparsity in real-time, achieving high acceptance rates while maintaining acceleration benefits. We evaluate CLaSp on the LLaMA3 series models using Spec-Bench (Xia et al., 2024b), comprehensive benchmark for speculative decoding across diverse scenarios. CLaSp achieves 1.3 1.7 wallclock time speedup compared to conventional autoregressive decoding while preserving the original distribution of generated text. Our contributions are summarized as follows: We introduce CLaSp, self-speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the layer-skipping strategy based on context. We propose performance optimization strategies in CLaSp to fully leverage GPU parallelism, making the extra latency from layer optimization almost negligible. We conduct extensive experiments on SpecBench, showing that CLaSp consistently achieves 1.3 1.7 speedup without training, and provide detailed analysis of its key hyper-parameters.Speculative Decoding.

Recent advances in reasoning-centric language models have highlighted reinforcement learning (RL) as a promising method for aligning models with verifiable rewards. However, it remains contentious whether RL truly expands a model's reasoning capabilities or merely amplifies high-reward outputs already latent in the base model's distribution, and whether continually scaling up RL compute reliably leads to improved reasoning performance. In this work, we challenge prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that prolonged RL (ProRL) training can uncover novel reasoning strategies that are inaccessible to base models, even under extensive sampling. We introduce ProRL, a novel training methodology that incorporates KL divergence control, reference policy resetting, and a diverse suite of tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals that RL-trained models consistently outperform base models across a wide range of pass@k evaluations, including scenarios where base models fail entirely regardless of the number of attempts. We further show that reasoning boundary improvements correlates strongly with task competence of base model and training duration, suggesting that RL can explore and populate new regions of solution space over time. These findings offer new insights into the conditions under which RL meaningfully expands reasoning boundaries in language models and establish a foundation for future work on long-horizon RL for reasoning.

Verifiers play a crucial role in large language model (LLM) reasoning, needed by post-training techniques such as reinforcement learning. However, reliable verifiers are hard to get for difficult coding problems, because a well-disguised wrong solution may only be detected by carefully human-written edge cases that are difficult to synthesize. To address this issue, we propose HARDTESTGEN, a pipeline for high-quality test synthesis using LLMs. With this pipeline, we curate a comprehensive competitive programming dataset HARDTESTS with 47k problems and synthetic high-quality tests. Compared with existing tests, HARDTESTGEN tests demonstrate precision that is 11.3 percentage points higher and recall that is 17.5 percentage points higher when evaluating LLM-generated code. For harder problems, the improvement in precision can be as large as 40 points. HARDTESTS also proves to be more effective for model training, measured by downstream code generation performance. We will open-source our dataset and synthesis pipeline at https://leililab.github.io/HardTests/.

Speculative decoding (SD) is a promising method for accelerating the decoding process of Large Language Models (LLMs). The efficiency of SD primarily hinges on the consistency between the draft model and the verify model. However, existing drafting approaches typically require additional modules to be trained, which can be challenging to implement and ensure compatibility across various LLMs. In this paper, we propose CLaSp, an in-context layer-skipping strategy for self-speculative decoding. Unlike prior methods, CLaSp does not require additional drafting modules or extra training. Instead, it employs a plug-and-play mechanism by skipping intermediate layers of the verify model to construct a compressed draft model. Specifically, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm that optimizes the layer-skipping process by leveraging the complete hidden states from the last verification stage as an objective. This enables CLaSp to dynamically adjust its layer-skipping strategy after each verification stage, without relying on pre-optimized sets of skipped layers. Experimental results across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that CLaSp achieves a speedup of 1.3x ~ 1.7x on LLaMA3 series models without altering the original distribution of the generated text.

However, existing drafting approaches typically require additional modules to be trained, which can be challenging to implement and ensure compatibility across various LLMs. In this paper, we propose CLaSp, an in-context layer-skipping strategy for self-speculative decoding. Unlike prior methods, CLaSp does not require additional drafting modules or extra training. Instead, it employs a plug-and-play mechanism by skipping intermediate layers of the verify model to construct a compressed draft model. Specifically, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm that optimizes the layer-skipping process by leveraging the complete hidden states from the last verification stage as an objective. This enables CLaSp to dynamically adjust its layer-skipping strategy after each verification stage, without relying on pre-optimized sets of skipped layers. Experimental results across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that CLaSp achieves a speedup of 1.3x ~ 1.7x on LLaMA3 series models without altering the original distribution of the generated text."

A critical component in the trustworthiness of LLMs is reliable uncertainty communication, yet LLMs often use assertive language when conveying false claims, leading to over-reliance and eroded trust. We present the first systematic study of faithful confidence calibration of LLMs, benchmarking models' ability to use linguistic expressions of uncertainty that faithfully reflect their intrinsic uncertainty, across a comprehensive array of models, datasets, and prompting strategies. Our results demonstrate that LLMs largely fail at this task, and that existing interventions are insufficient: standard prompt approaches provide only marginal gains, and existing, factuality-based calibration techniques can even harm faithful calibration. To address this critical gap, we introduce MetaFaith, a novel prompt-based calibration approach inspired by human metacognition. We show that MetaFaith robustly improves faithful calibration across diverse models and task domains, enabling up to 61% improvement in faithfulness and achieving an 83% win rate over original generations as judged by humans.

Large language models (LLMs) memorize a vast amount of prior knowledge from the Internet that help them on downstream tasks but also may notoriously sway their outputs towards wrong or biased answers. In this work, we test how the knowledge about popular subjects hurt the accuracy of vision language models (VLMs) on standard, objective visual tasks of counting and identification. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs are strongly biased (e.g, unable to recognize a fourth stripe has been added to a 3-stripe Adidas logo) scoring an average of 17.05% accuracy in counting (e.g., counting stripes in an Adidas-like logo) across 7 diverse domains from animals, logos, chess, board games, optical illusions, to patterned grids. Insert text (e.g., "Adidas") describing the subject name into the counterfactual image further decreases VLM accuracy. The biases in VLMs are so strong that instructing them to double-check their results or rely exclusively on image details to answer improves counting accuracy by only +2 points, on average. Our work presents an interesting failure mode in VLMs and an automated framework for testing VLM biases. Code and data are available at: vlmsarebiased.github.io.

v1 enhances Multimodal Large Language Models by enabling selective and dynamic visual region retrieval during inference, improving performance on multimodal reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present v1, a lightweight extension to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that enables selective visual revisitation during inference. While current MLLMs typically consume visual input only once and reason purely over internal memory, v1 introduces a simple point-and-copy mechanism that allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant image regions throughout the reasoning process. This mechanism augments existing architectures with minimal modifications, enabling contextual access to visual tokens based on the model's evolving hypotheses. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations. Experiments on three multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks -- MathVista, MathVision, and MathVerse -- demonstrate that v1 consistently improves performance over comparable baselines, particularly on tasks requiring fine-grained visual reference and multi-step reasoning. Our results suggest that dynamic visual access is a promising direction for enhancing grounded multimodal reasoning. Code, models, and data will be released to support future research.

"v1 enhances Multimodal Large Language Models by enabling selective and dynamic visual region retrieval during inference, improving performance on multimodal reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present v1, a lightweight extension to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that enables selective visual revisitation during inference. While current MLLMs typically consume visual input only once and reason purely over internal memory, v1 introduces a simple point-and-copy mechanism that allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant image regions throughout the reasoning process. This mechanism augments existing architectures with minimal modifications, enabling contextual access to visual tokens based on the model's evolving hypotheses. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations. Experiments on three multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks -- MathVista, MathVision, and MathVerse -- demonstrate that v1 consistently improves performance over comparable baselines, particularly on tasks requiring fine-grained visual reference and multi-step reasoning. Our results suggest that dynamic visual access is a promising direction for enhancing grounded multimodal reasoning. Code, models, and data will be released to support future research."
