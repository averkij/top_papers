Introduction Generalist robot policies with open-world capabilities is essential for deploying autonomous robots in real scenarios, where they need to tackle diverse tasks, follow various instructions, adapt to different situations, and even handle unforeseen events. In the realm of digit domains, the paradigm of learning from large-scale multimodal datasets has demonstrated broad proficiency and generalization across various interactive and assistive applications. Extending this idea to the physical world, researchers are now training large vision-language-action models on extensive robotic datasets to realize generalist robots with similar versatility. Although recent efforts have demonstrated impressive progress in achieving dexterous manipulation and long-horizon physical control within constrained environments, open world generalization remains the central challenge for developing general-purpose autonomous AI agents in the physical world (Black et al., 2025, Gemini-Robotics, 2025). To address this challenge, robots must be capable of acquiring comprehensive world knowledge, engaging in human-level reasoning, and executing dexterous actions. Early generalist robot policies (Kim et al., 2024, Black et al., 2024, Pertsch et al., 2025) primarily extend visionlanguage models (VLMs) into vision-language-action (VLA) models with domain-specific robotic data, either through auto-regressive decoding of discrete action tokens or by incorporating additional continuous flow matching modules. However, because these VLA models are trained exclusively on robotic datasets, they are restricted to narrow task domains and specific environments. As result, they suffer from diminished general semantic knowledge inherited from VLMs and exhibit limited instruction-following capabilities. EO-Robotics Team, Shanghai AI Laboratory; Fudan University; AgiBot; Northwestern Polytechnical University EmbodiedOneVision: Interleaved Vision-Text-Action Pretraining for General Robot Control Recently, several studies (Black et al., 2025, Driess et al., 2025, Lin et al., 2025) have explored co-training VLA models with both web data and robotic data, showing promising generality when interacting with new objects and unseen backgrounds. Nevertheless, existing approaches remain predominantly generating robot action at the end of the VLA output sequence, overlooking the rich temporal dynamics and causal dependencies among vision, language, and action modalities inherent in open-world embodied interactions. Humans, in contrast, exhibit flexible and interleaved synergy between multimodal embodied reasoning and physical action, enabling highly generalizable and dexterous manipulation in the open world, i.e., reasoning guides action and action results inform subsequent reasoning. This raises fundamental research question: How can we design an effective training paradigm for generalist robot policies that support flexible and mutual-informed reasoning-acting integration? Inspired by the impressive results of advanced multimodal understanding and generation systems (Deng et al., 2025, Ma et al., 2025b, Xie et al., 2025, NextStep-1, 2025), which demonstrate the superiority in interleaved multimodal pretraining, we propose unified embodied model to enable flexible and powerful multimodal embodied reasoning and action generation through interleaved embodied pretraining. Achieving this requires not only an effective and unified architecture that excels in mix-modality generation, but also carefully structured multimodal embodied data that jointly integrate texts, images, videos, and robotic actions. To realize this vision, we first established new protocol for scalable data curating, filtering, and construction of high-quality multimodal interleaved embodied data. As for data source, we integrate web vision-language data with real robot episodes, the latter naturally providing actionlevel, temporal, and physical continuity. Then, we employ VLMs and human to annotate real robot episodes with diverse embodied temporal and spatial QA pairs, including physical common sense understanding, task planning, object localization, affordance pointing, and multi-view correspondence. These annotations enable the learning of fine-grained geometric and spatial-temporal representations of the physical world. Finally, the interleaved vision-text-action data is constructed by concatenating these multimodal QA and robot control "

R-4B, an auto-thinking multimodal large language model, uses bi-mode annealing and Bi-mode Policy Optimization to adaptively decide on problem-solving strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower computational cost.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query. Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower computational cost.

"EO-Robotics, comprising EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset, advances multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training.  					AI-generated summary 				 The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work, introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive, high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for developing advanced embodied foundation models."

A.S.E is a benchmark for evaluating the security of code generated by large language models using real-world repositories and expert-defined rules, revealing insights into model performance and decoding strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering necessitates rigorous security evaluation of their generated code. However, existing benchmarks are inadequate, as they focus on isolated code snippets, employ unstable evaluation methods that lack reproducibility, and fail to connect the quality of input context with the security of the output. To address these gaps, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security Evaluation), a benchmark for repository-level secure code generation. A.S.E constructs tasks from real-world repositories with documented CVEs, preserving full repository context like build systems and cross-file dependencies. Its reproducible, containerized evaluation framework uses expert-defined rules to provide stable, auditable assessments of security, build quality, and generation stability. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on A.S.E reveals three key findings: (1) Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves the best overall performance. (2) The security gap between proprietary and open-source models is narrow; Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct attains the top security score. (3) Concise, ``fast-thinking'' decoding strategies consistently outperform complex, ``slow-thinking'' reasoning for security patching.
