INTRODUCTION EEP Neural Networks (DNNs) have driven major advances in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, thanks to their capacity to learn hierarchical data representations through the composition of multiple non-linear layers [1][3]. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) similarly benefit from depth, both in their architectural design and through their temporal unfolding, which effectively creates deep computational graphs across time steps. This temporal depth makes RNNs powerful for modeling sequential data but also introduces challenges analogous to those encountered in deep feedforward networks, such as vanishing and exploding gradients [4], [5]. These issues, compounded by increased computational demands, hinder the training of very deep recurrent models. Randomized untrained models offer an alternative to gradient-based training. In particular, the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework [6] uses fixed recurrent dynamics and trains only readout layer, reducing training complexity. Deep Echo State Networks (DeepESNs) [7] extend this idea by stacking multiple untrained reservoirs to build temporal hierarchies. However, while RC models bypass backpropagation, they are still susceptible to signal degradation or amplification in the forward pass, both in the temporal dimension and architectural dimension. These effects can impair the stability and expressiveness of the model, limiting their effectiveness on complex temporal tasks. To address analogous issues in Preprint. Under review. The authors are with the Department of Computer Science, University of Pisa, 56127 Pisa, Italy (e-mail: matteo.pinna@di.unipi.it; andrea.ceni@unipi.it; claudio.gallicchio@unipi.it). 1Code will be publicly available at github.com/nennomp/deepresesn. Fig. 1. Architectural organization of the proposed DeepResESN. (a) Structure of generic l-th reservoir layer in DeepResESN. The reservoir structure (shown in blue) consists of an input weight matrix W(l) , recurrent weight matrix W(l) , and non-linear activation function ϕ. The temporal residual connection (shown in purple) is modulated by an orthogonal matrix O. The temporal residual and non-linear paths are scaled by positive coefficients α(l) and β(l), respectively. (b) Complete illustration of DeepResESN architecture with NL reservoir layers. The first layer acts as residual reservoir in traditional shallow architecture and is fed the external input x(1). Subsequent layers receive as input the output of the previous reservoir, h(l1). The readout may be fed either the final layer states or the concatenation of states from all layers. See Section III for details. feedforward architectures, residual connections have proven highly effective. Introduced in the context of convolutional networks, Residual Networks (ResNets) [8] enhance information flow by incorporating identity-based skip connections, thereby enabling the training of very deep models. Although originally proposed for fully-trainable networks, the core principle, facilitating signal propagation through additional paths, is broadly applicable and conceptually appealing for mitigating dynamical degradation in untrained settings as well. Although residual pathways are promising solution, they remain underexplored in recurrent architectures. Some prior work has introduced temporal skip connections in trainable RNNs [9], [10], while Residual Echo State Networks (ResESNs) [11] applied temporal residual dynamics to shallow RC models. However, their extension to deep untrained RNNs has not yet been explored. In this paper, we introduce Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs), novel class of deep untrained RNNs that unify the hierarchical representation capabilities of DeepESNs with the enhanced temporal signal propagation of ResESNs, thereby providing principled generalization of both architectures. The architecture is graphically highlighted in Fig. 1. Specifically, (i) we propose deep RC model in which each untrained recurrent layer is augmented with temporal residual connection, governed by configurable mappings such as random orthogonal, cyclic, or identity transformations; (ii) we explore the effect of each transformation on the networks dynamics, leveraging spectral frequency analysis tools; (iii) we provide comprehensive mathematical analysis of DeepResESN dynamics, deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for stability and contractivity, and extending the Echo State Property (ESP) to the deep residual case; (iv) we evaluate DeepResESNs on time series tasks spanning memory, forecasting, and classification. The results demonstrate consistent improvements over both shallow and deep RC baselines, especially in settings requiring long-term temporal modeling. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces background on RC. Section III presents the DeepResESN architecture and the spectral frequency analysis. Section IV presents our theoretical analysis. Section details empirical evaluations, and Section VI concludes the paper. The paper also includes an Appendix A, which is dedicated to mathematical proofs. II. RESERVOIR COMPU"

Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs) enhance long-term temporal modeling and memory capacity through hierarchical untrained residual layers, outperforming traditional shallow and deep reservoir computing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.
