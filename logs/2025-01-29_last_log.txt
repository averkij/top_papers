Text:"SFT Memorizes, RL Generalizes: Comparative Study of Foundation Model Post-training Tianzhe Chu * Yuexiang Zhai * Jihan Yang Shengbang Tong Saining Xie Dale Schuurmans Quoc V. Le Sergey Levine Yi Ma 5 2 0 2 8 2 ] A . [ 1 1 6 1 7 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r Abstract Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their respective role in enhancing model generalization remains unclear. This paper studies the comparative effect of SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based and visual environments. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and also consider V-IRL, real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes in both the rule-based textual and visual environments. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize the training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution in either scenario. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the models underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in visual domains. Despite RLs superior generalization, we show that SFT is still helpful for effective RL training: SFT stabilizes the models output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrate the advantage of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multimodal tasks. 1.

[ 1 6 1 1 7 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r aThe growing computational demands of training large language models (LLMs) necessitate more efficient methods. Quantized training presents promising solution by enabling low-bit arithmetic operations to reduce these costs. While FP8 precision has demonstrated feasibility, leveraging FP4 remains challenge due to significant quantization errors and limited representational capacity. This work introduces the first FP4 training framework for LLMs, addressing these challenges with two key innovations: differentiable quantization estimator for precise weight updates and an outlier clamping and compensation strategy to prevent activation collapse. To ensure stability, the framework integrates mixed-precision training scheme and vector-wise quantization. Experimental results demonstrate that our FP4 framework achieves accuracy comparable to BF16 and FP8, with minimal degradation, scaling effectively to 13B-parameter LLMs trained on up to 100B tokens. With the emergence of next-generation hardware supporting FP4, our framework sets foundation for efficient ultra-low precision training. 1. Introduction In the past two years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped both research priorities and industrial practices. Theoretical analyses and empirical evidence consistently demonstrate that scaling up model size leads to substantial performance improvements (Kaplan et al., 2020; Bi et al., 2024). However, training such large-scale models poses considerable challenges, demanding extensive time, energy, and financial resources. For example, Llama 3 (Dubey et al., 2024) 405B Work done during internship in MSRA 1University of Science and Technology of China 2Microsoft SIGMA Team 3Microsoft Research Asia. to: Yeyun Gong <yegong@microsoft.com>, Peng Cheng <pengc@microsoft.com>. Correspondence Figure 1. Directly casting to FP4 results in significantly higher training loss, whereas our proposed FP4 method achieves accuracy comparable to the BF16 baseline. These results are based on experiments with 400M LLaMA2 model. is trained on up to 16K H100 GPUs for 54 days. Similarly, GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023), with an estimated 1T parameters, required an extraordinary amount of computational power. These examples highlight the urgent need for more efficient training methods to keep up with the increasing demands of LLM development. Model quantization has proven to be an effective technique for reducing training costs, as low-bit arithmetic kernels can save memory and accelerate computations when used appropriately. Most LLM training systems traditionally rely on FP32 (full precision) or FP16/BF16 (half precision) data formats, but quantization enables these formats to be reduced to lower precision, such as 8-bit or even 4-bit. Recent advancements in computational hardware, such as NVIDIAs H100 GPUs (Nvidia, 2023) and the upcoming B200 GPUs (Nvidia, 2024), have introduced support for low-bit arithmetic kernels, enabling more efficient computation. The Hopper series GPUs feature high-performance FP8 tensor cores, delivering 2x speed-up compared to FP16 tensor cores. Meanwhile, the Blackwell series GPUs extend this capability by supporting FP6 and FP4 formats, with FP4 offering the potential to double computational throughput over FP8. Studies like FP8-LM (Peng et al., 2023) and NVIDIAs Transformer Engine (Nvidia, 2022) have demonstrated the feasibility of FP8 tensor cores for model training. But the application of FP4 tensor cores in 1 Optimizing Large Language Model Training Using FP4 Quantization model training remains an open research question. However, leveraging 4-bit data formats for neural network training presents significant challenges due to the extremely limited bit width. Directly quantizing LLMs to such lowbit format often results in substantial accuracy degradation, as shown in Figure 1. This is primarily because low-bit formats are constrained by limited dynamic range, which increases the risk of overflow and underflow. Even existing methods for 8-bit quantization experience some degree of accuracy loss, underscoring the difficulties of employing 4-bit format, which provides only 16 distinct representable values. In this study, we pioneeringly propose framework for training language models using the FP4 format, providing validation of the feasibility of this ultra-low precision representation. To tackle the significant quantization errors associated with weights and activations during model training, we present series of optimization techniques: (1) For weights, we present differentiable quantization estimator to improve gradient updates in FP4 computations. By analyzing the impact of quantization on neural network forward and backward passes, we derive function with correction terms for accurate gradient estimation; (2) For activations, we develop an outlier clamping and compensation strategy to address the issue of outlier values commonly observed during LLM training. By analyzing activation distributions in LLMs, we introduce clamping method and sparse auxiliary matrix to preserve quantization accuracy and maintain model performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate that our FP4 training framework achieves accuracy comparable to models trained in BF16 or FP8 formats with the same hyperparameters. Leveraging the FP8 tensor cores of NVIDIA H100 GPUs to emulate FP4 computations, we train LLMs with up to 13B parameters and 100B training tokens, with minor training loss gap. For zero-shot evaluation on downstream tasks, model trained with FP4 show competitive results against BF16 models. We anticipate better speed performance gains with the availability of next-generation hardware like NVIDIAs B-series GPUs. We will opensource our training code to facilitate future research and adoption. 2.

This is commonly represented as ExMy, where and denote the number of bits for the exponent and mantissa, respectively. For example, FP16 uses E5M10 and BF16 uses E8M7.

Text:"Over-Tokenized Transformer: Vocabulary is Generally Worth Scaling Hongzhi Huang 1 Defa Zhu 1 Banggu Wu 1 Yutao Zeng 1 Ya Wang 1 Qiyang Min 1 Xun Zhou 1 5 2 0 2 8 2 ] . [ 1 5 7 9 6 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r aTokenization is fundamental component of large language models (LLMs), yet its influence on model scaling and performance is not fully explored. In this paper, we introduce OverTokenized Transformers, novel framework that decouples input and output vocabularies to improve language modeling performance. Specifically, our approach scales up input vocabularies to leverage multi-gram tokens. Through extensive experiments, we uncover log-linear relationship between input vocabulary size and training loss, demonstrating that larger input vocabularies consistently enhance model performance, regardless of model size. Using large input vocabulary, we achieve performance comparable to doublesized baselines with no additional cost. Our findings highlight the importance of tokenization in scaling laws and provide practical insight for tokenizer design, paving the way for more efficient and powerful LLMs. 1. Introduction The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by innovations in model architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017) and training paradigms (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). Moreover, with the guidance of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020), models prove to become stronger with increasing number of parameters or training data. Tokenization, the process of converting raw text into discrete tokens as the input and output of the model, is recently found relevant to scaling laws, where larger models deserve larger vocabulary and achieve better performance under the same training cost (Tao et al., 2024). In fact, expanding the input vocabulary incurs almost no additional computational cost, whereas expanding the output vocabulary significantly increases the training overhead for smaller models. Thus, it is natural to consider decoupling the input and output vocabularies for separate investigations. 1Seed-Foundation-Model Team, Bytedance. Correspondence to: Hongzhi Huang <huanghongzhi.51@bytedance.com>. Figure 1: Scaling trend for Over-Encoded models and baselines on OLMo2. We plot the loss with 400B tokens training. For over-encoding, input vocabulary size is extended from 0.1 to 1.2 and 12.8 million (12 and 128 larger than baseline), referred to as OE-1.2M and OE-12.8M. We observe OE-12.8M with 400M parameters matches the baseline with 1B parameters. Our research is fundamentally based on this idea. Starting with synthetic experiments on context-free grammar modeling, we systematically analyze the effects of token granularity and vocabulary size on models of varying scales. Firstly, it is revealed that larger tokenizers improve the performance of larger models while introducing challenges for smaller ones, which is consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, once the input and output vocabulary is decoupled, we find that scaling up input vocabulary solely keeps improving model, while larger output vocabulary may be harmful to smaller models. This insight motivates the development of Over-Tokenized Transformers, which decouple the encoding and decoding vocabularies to achieve greater flexibility and performance gains. Specifically, we introduce Over-Encoding(OE), which utilizes large hierarchical n-gram input vocabulary. As shown in Figure 1, our method improves the model scalability by significant margin. Increasing the input vocabulary size by 128, our 400M model matches the training loss of 1B baseline with no additional training cost (see left panel). More interestingly, we observe strong log-linear relationship between the input vocabulary size and model performance, i.e., exponentially increasing the input vocabulary size consistently results in linear decrease in loss (see right panel). These findings represent new dimension 1 in scaling laws and also indicate embedding parameters as new scalable sparse dimension. Moreover, we propose the concept of Over-Decoding(OD), which leverages larger output vocabulary to provide more fine-grained supervision. We typically treat multi-token prediction methods (Gloeckle et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024) as approximations of OD. Combining OE and OD together, we build OverTokenized Transformer, which shows greater potential than apply either OE or OD solely. Although introducing large amount of embedding parameters for OE, the training and inference cost barely increases, as embedding parameters are used in an extremely sparse manner. In practice, we propose efficient engineering solutions to mitigate the computational and memory challenges introduced by large vocabularies, resulting an additional training overhead less than 5%. Through this work, we aim to bridge the gap between tokenizer design and model scaling, positioning tokenization as critical factor in the continued evolution of large language models. 2. Related Work 2.1. Tokenization Design Tokenization is critical component in the development of large language models (LLMs). Established methods such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) (Sennrich, 2015) and Unigram Language Models (Kudo, 2018) have been widely adopted to create subword vocabularies that balance sequence length and vocabulary size. Recently, alternative paradigms have been proposed to address the computational inefficiencies of byte-level models (Xue et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2023). For instance, MegaByte (Yu et al., 2023) combines byte-level modeling with patching by first predicting patches and then predicting bytes within each patch, improving processing efficiency. However, its performance at scale remains inferior to that of tokenizer-based approaches. Building on this concept, In this work, our findings suggest that applying n-gram patching on top of BPE expands the vocabulary size, improving model capability, while BLT (Pagnoni et al., 2024) also has the same finding on byte-level models. 2.2. Scaling Vocabulary Recent empirical studies have systematically investigated the relationship between vocabulary size and model performance. (Tao et al., 2024) demonstrates that expanded vocabularies enhance both training efficiency and model performance, particularly in larger architectures. Building on these findings, we argue that vocabulary size research should separately consider embedding (input) and unembedding (output). While embedding incurs only lookup costs, unembedding introduces compu"

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.

"Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used post-training techniques for foundation models. However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks."

The growing computational demands of training large language models (LLMs) necessitate more efficient methods. Quantized training presents a promising solution by enabling low-bit arithmetic operations to reduce these costs. While FP8 precision has demonstrated feasibility, leveraging FP4 remains a challenge due to significant quantization errors and limited representational capacity. This work introduces the first FP4 training framework for LLMs, addressing these challenges with two key innovations: a differentiable quantization estimator for precise weight updates and an outlier clamping and compensation strategy to prevent activation collapse. To ensure stability, the framework integrates a mixed-precision training scheme and vector-wise quantization. Experimental results demonstrate that our FP4 framework achieves accuracy comparable to BF16 and FP8, with minimal degradation, scaling effectively to 13B-parameter LLMs trained on up to 100B tokens. With the emergence of next-generation hardware supporting FP4, our framework sets a foundation for efficient ultra-low precision training.

Tokenization is a fundamental component of large language models (LLMs), yet its influence on model scaling and performance is not fully explored. In this paper, we introduce Over-Tokenized Transformers, a novel framework that decouples input and output vocabularies to improve language modeling performance. Specifically, our approach scales up input vocabularies to leverage multi-gram tokens. Through extensive experiments, we uncover a log-linear relationship between input vocabulary size and training loss, demonstrating that larger input vocabularies consistently enhance model performance, regardless of model size. Using a large input vocabulary, we achieve performance comparable to double-sized baselines with no additional cost. Our findings highlight the importance of tokenization in scaling laws and provide practical insight for tokenizer design, paving the way for more efficient and powerful LLMs.

Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the computational mechanisms underlying neural networks' capabilities in order to accomplish concrete scientific and engineering goals. Progress in this field thus promises to provide greater assurance over AI system behavior and shed light on exciting scientific questions about the nature of intelligence. Despite recent progress toward these goals, there are many open problems in the field that require solutions before many scientific and practical benefits can be realized: Our methods require both conceptual and practical improvements to reveal deeper insights; we must figure out how best to apply our methods in pursuit of specific goals; and the field must grapple with socio-technical challenges that influence and are influenced by our work. This forward-facing review discusses the current frontier of mechanistic interpretability and the open problems that the field may benefit from prioritizing.

Despite recent progress toward these goals, there are many open problems in the field that require solutions before many scientific and practical benefits can be realized: Our methods require both conceptual and practical improvements to reveal deeper insights; we must figure out how best to apply our methods in pursuit of specific goals; and the field must grapple with socio-technical challenges that influence and are influenced by our work. This forward-facing review discusses the current frontier of mechanistic interpretability and the open problems that the field may benefit from prioritizing."
