As the research of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) becomes popular, an advancing MLLM model is typically required to handle various textual and visual tasks (e.g., VQA, Detection, OCR, and ChartQA) simultaneously for real-world applications. However, due to the significant differences in representation and distribution among data from various tasks, simply mixing data of all tasks together leads to the well-knownmulti-task conflict issue, resulting in performance degradation across various tasks.

To speed up the training and inference of Awaker2.5-VL, each expert in our model is devised as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) structure.

The evolution of machine learning has increasingly prioritized the development of powerful models and more scalable supervision signals. However, the emergence of foundation models presents significant challenges in providing effective supervision signals necessary for further enhancing their capabilities. Consequently, there is an urgent need to explore novel supervision signals and technical approaches. In this paper, we propose verifier engineering, a novel post-training paradigm specifically designed for the era of foundation models. The core of verifier engineering involves leveraging a suite of automated verifiers to perform verification tasks and deliver meaningful feedback to foundation models. We systematically categorize the verifier engineering process into three essential stages: search, verify, and feedback, and provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research developments within each stage. We believe that verifier engineering constitutes a fundamental pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence.

"As the research of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) becomes popular, an advancing MLLM model is typically required to handle various textual and visual tasks (e.g., VQA, Detection, OCR, and ChartQA) simultaneously for real-world applications. However, due to the significant differences in representation and distribution among data from various tasks, simply mixing data of all tasks together leads to the well-known``multi-task conflict" issue, resulting in performance degradation across various tasks. To address this issue, we propose Awaker2.5-VL, a Mixture of Experts~(MoE) architecture suitable for MLLM, which acquires the multi-task capabilities through multiple sparsely activated experts. To speed up the training and inference of Awaker2.5-VL, each expert in our model is devised as a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) structure. Extensive experiments on multiple latest benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of Awaker2.5-VL. The code and model weight are released in our Project Page: https://github.com/MetabrainAGI/Awaker."

Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as powerful generative models for various tasks, including image, video, and speech synthesis. However, their inference process remains computationally expensive due to the repeated evaluation of resource-intensive attention and feed-forward modules. To address this, we introduce SmoothCache, a model-agnostic inference acceleration technique for DiT architectures. SmoothCache leverages the observed high similarity between layer outputs across adjacent diffusion timesteps. By analyzing layer-wise representation errors from a small calibration set, SmoothCache adaptively caches and reuses key features during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SmoothCache achieves 8% to 71% speed up while maintaining or even improving generation quality across diverse modalities. We showcase its effectiveness on DiT-XL for image generation, Open-Sora for text-to-video, and Stable Audio Open for text-to-audio, highlighting its potential to enable real-time applications and broaden the accessibility of powerful DiT models.

Although image-based virtual try-on has made considerable progress, emerging approaches still encounter challenges in producing high-fidelity and robust fitting images across diverse scenarios. These methods often struggle with issues such as texture-aware maintenance and size-aware fitting, which hinder their overall effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose a novel garment perception enhancement technique, termed FitDiT, designed for high-fidelity virtual try-on using Diffusion Transformers (DiT) allocating more parameters and attention to high-resolution features. First, to further improve texture-aware maintenance, we introduce a garment texture extractor that incorporates garment priors evolution to fine-tune garment feature, facilitating to better capture rich details such as stripes, patterns, and text. Additionally, we introduce frequency-domain learning by customizing a frequency distance loss to enhance high-frequency garment details. To tackle the size-aware fitting issue, we employ a dilated-relaxed mask strategy that adapts to the correct length of garments, preventing the generation of garments that fill the entire mask area during cross-category try-on. Equipped with the above design, FitDiT surpasses all baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. It excels in producing well-fitting garments with photorealistic and intricate details, while also achieving competitive inference times of 4.57 seconds for a single 1024x768 image after DiT structure slimming, outperforming existing methods.
