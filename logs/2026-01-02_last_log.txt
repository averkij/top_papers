Text:"Dream2Flow: Bridging Video Generation and Open-World Manipulation with 3D Object Flow Karthik Dharmarajan, Wenlong Huang, Jiajun Wu, Li Fei-Fei*, Ruohan Zhang* Stanford University 5 2 0 2 1 3 ] . [ 1 6 6 7 4 2 . 2 1 5 2 : r Fig. 1: Dream2Flow leverages off-the-shelf video generation models to produce videos of the task being performed in the same scene of the robot. Dream2Flow then extracts 3D object flow from the motion in the video, allowing for downstream planning and execution with robot across wide variety of tasks. Abstract Generative video modeling has emerged as compelling tool to zero-shot reason about plausible physical interactions for open-world manipulation. Yet, it remains challenge to translate such human-led motions into the low-level actions demanded by robotic systems. We observe that given an initial image and task instruction, these models excel at synthesizing sensible object motions. Thus, we introduce Dream2Flow, framework that bridges video generation and robotic control through 3D object flow as an intermediate representation. Our method reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos and formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking. By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categoriesincluding rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments highlight 3D object flow as general and scalable interface for adapting video generation models to open-world robotic manipulation.

In this work, we show that the impact of model capacity varies across timesteps: it is crucial for the early and late stages but largely negligible during the intermediate stage. Accordingly, we propose FlowBlending, a stage-aware multi-model sampling strategy that employs a large model and a small model at capacity-sensitive stages and intermediate stages, respectively. We further introduce simple criteria to choose stage boundaries and provide a velocity-divergence analysis as an effective proxy for identifying capacity-sensitive regions. Across LTX-Video (2B/13B) and WAN 2.1 (1.3B/14B), FlowBlending achieves up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs, while maintaining the visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and semantic alignment of the large models. FlowBlending is also compatible with existing sampling-acceleration techniques, enabling up to 2x additional speedup.

Accordingly, we propose FlowBlending, a stage-aware multi-model sampling strategy that employs a large model and a small model at capacity-sensitive stages and intermediate stages, respectively. We further introduce simple criteria to choose stage boundaries and provide a velocity-divergence analysis as an effective proxy for identifying capacity-sensitive regions. Across LTX-Video (2B/13B) and WAN 2.1 (1.3B/14B), FlowBlending achieves up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs, while maintaining the visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and semantic alignment of the large models. FlowBlending is also compatible with existing sampling-acceleration techniques, enabling up to 2x additional speedup.

The paper focuses on optimizing inference efficiency through a stage-aware multi-model sampling strategy that reduces computational cost (FLOPs) and inference time while maintaining quality. This is directly related to training and inference optimization methods.
