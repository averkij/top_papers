Extensive experiments across four domains (sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration) demonstrate that DiffThinker significantly outperforms leading closed source models including GPT-5 (+314.2%) and Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6%), as well as the fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-32B baseline (+39.0%), highlighting generative multimodal reasoning as promising approach for vision-centric reasoning. 1. Introduction In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) (Google, 2025a; OpenAI, 2025a; Bai et al., 2025; Comanici et al., 2025) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal understanding. The introduction of Chain-ofThought (CoT) empowers these models with complex reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (Shao et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025c) has substantially enhanced the reasonDiffThinker: Towards Generative Multimodal Reasoning with Diffusion Models ing capabilities of MLLMs (Wang et al., 2025a). Building upon these foundations, the emerging paradigm of Thinking with Image (OpenAI, 2025b; Zheng et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b; Su et al., 2025b) enables MLLMs to interact with multimodal inputs iteratively, further pushing the boundaries of multimodal reasoning. Despite these advances, current MLLMs primarily rely on lengthy CoT for reasoning, resulting in uncontrollable generation and prohibitive latency (Sui et al., 2025; Qu et al., 2025). This inefficiency is further intensified by the multiturn interactions inherent in the Thinking with Image paradigm. More importantly, these reasoning processes stay predominantly text-centric and struggle to track the changing state of visual information over long sequences, posing significant challenges for complex long-horizon, visioncentric tasks (Wu et al., 2024; Ivanitskiy et al., 2023). To address these limitations, in this paper, we introduce DiffThinker, and establish Generative Multimodal Reasoning as novel paradigm that shifts the reasoning from symbolic space to visual space. Unlike MLLMs that typically conceptualize reasoning as multimodal-to-text mapping, we propose to model multimodal reasoning directly as generative image-to-image task with diffusion models. We conduct systematic comparison between DiffThinker and MLLMs across diverse set of challenging tasks, and provide the first in-depth investigation into the intrinsic characteristics of generative multimodal reasoning, revealing four core properties of DiffThinker: ① Efficient Reasoning: It demonstrates superior efficiency in both training and inference, as well as higher accuracy, significantly outperforming RL-based MLLMs. ② Controllable Reasoning: It provides stable and controllable inference costs, contrasting with the variable length CoT in MLLMs. ③ Native Parallel Reasoning: It inherently explores multiple candidate solutions in parallel, progressively pruning invalid paths. ④ Collaborative Reasoning: It acts as partner with MLLMs, achieve performance surpassing either model alone. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of DiffThinker, we conduct experiments across seven tasks in four domains including sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration. The results demonstrate that DiffThinker significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT5 (+314.2%), Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6%), and the Qwen3VL-32B baseline fine-tuned on identical datasets (+39.0%). Furthermore, we extend DiffThinker to the image-to-video generation paradigm for multimodal reasoning, and propose the DiffThinker-Video variant, demonstrating that video generation also exhibits inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities, and further highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of DiffThinker through comparative evaluations. In summary, our contributions are threefold: We propose DiffThinker and establish Generative Multimodal Reasoning as novel paradigm, reformulating multimodal reasoning from text-centric symbolic mapping to native image-to-image generative process. We perform systematic comparison between DiffThinker and MLLMs across multiple domains and conduct the first investigation into the intrinsic characteristics of this generative multimodal reasoning paradigm, revealing four core properties: efficiency, controllability, native parallelism, and collaboration. Extensive experiments on seven tasks demonstrate DiffThinker significantly outperforms SOTA MLLMs including GPT-5 (+314.2%) and Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6%), revealing generative multimodal reasoning as promising approach for vision-centric reasoning. 2.
