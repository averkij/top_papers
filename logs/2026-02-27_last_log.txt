Text:"AgentDropoutV2: Optimizing Information Flow in Multi-Agent Systems via Test-Time Rectify-or-Reject Pruning Yutong Wang 1 Siyuan Xiong 1 Xuebo Liu 1 Wenkang Zhou 1 Liang Ding 2 Miao Zhang 1 Min ZhangWhile Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel in complex reasoning, they suffer from the cascading impact of erroneous information generated by individual participants. Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, testtime rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MASs task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging contextaware indicators to resolve wide spectrum of error patterns.

Introduction Large language model (LLM)-based agents have achieved outstanding performance across wide range of tasks, including reasoning (Yao et al., 2023), planning (Prasad et al., *Equal contribution 1Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen 2Alibaba Group. Correspondence to: Xuebo Liu <liuxuebo@hit.edu.cn>. Preprint. February 27, 2026. 1 Figure 1. Overview of AgentDropoutV2 versus AgentDropout. While AgentDropout directly discards erroneous agents, AgentDropoutV2 attempts iterative rectification before elimination. 2024), and action (Park et al., 2023). Despite the sophisticated designs that have enabled these agents to achieve significant gains, the single-model paradigm remains bottleneck that limits their potential. Consequently, growing body of research has shifted focus towards designing multiagent systems (MAS) to address more complex scenarios (Li et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024). By harnessing collective intelligence (Zhuge et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024) and orchestrating cooperative teams (Zhang et al., 2025d; Dang et al., 2025), MAS achieves remarkable performance in complex tasks such as software development (Hong et al., 2024; Qian et al., 2024), ultra-long context handling (Li et al., 2024a; Zhao et al., 2024), and scientific discovery (Ghafarollahi & Buehler, 2025; Ghareeb et al., 2025). However, the structural complexity of MAS also renders them susceptible to erroneous outputs from individual participants due to error propagation (Zhang et al., 2025f; Pan et al., 2025b). This necessitates the timely identification and pruning of incorrect information to prevent it from cascading to downstream agents and ultimately compromising the entire task. To mitigate the impact of errors, current research has predominantly diverged into two main paradigms: Structural Optimization and Parameter Internalization. The former seeks to constrain error pathways by engineering robust communication topologies, such as optimizing directed acyclic graphs (DAG) (Zhang et al., 2025c; Wang et al., 2025b; Zhang et al., 2025e). The latter focuses on enhancing the intrinsic reasoning of agents by fine-tuning them on failure trajectories (Motwani et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025) or utilizing process-supervision data (Lightman et al., 2024; AgentDropoutV2: Optimizing Information Flow in Multi-Agent Systems via Test-Time Rectify-or-Reject Pruning Wang et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025b). However, despite their contributions, these paradigms share critical bottleneck: the reliance on offline optimization at the expense of test-time adaptivity. As illustrated in Figure 1, methods like AgentDropout rely on pre-determined structural priors derived from training statistics. They enforce static connectivity graph that permanently excludes certain agents without attempting to rehabilitate their outputs or rectify their errors. Similarly, parameter-based methods depend on frozen weights, rendering them incapable of dynamic correction. This static nature prevents the system from salvaging potentially correctable errors during inference, highlighting the urgent need for test-time rectification framework that can actively intercept and resolve failures in real-time. To this end, we introduce AgentDropoutV2, an MAS information flow optimization framework based on test-time rectify-or-reject pruning. During the execution process, our method intercepts the output of each participant agent to perform iterative rectification before it is broadcast to downstream successors. Specifically, dedicated rectifier is prompted to scrutinize the output using adversarial indicators retrieved from pre-constructed pool of prior failure patterns, generating targeted feedback if errors are detected. If the rectification fails to resolve the issues, the erroneous output is pruned to strictly prevent error propagation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances MAS performance across diverse mathematical and code generation benchmarks by effectively rectifying and eliminating erroneous agent outputs. Extended analyses further confirm the systems adaptability, showing its capability to dynamically retrieve context-aware indicators based on task complexity, and to efficiently resolve distinct error patterns through variable iterative refinement. The observed correlation between pruning rates and reasoning difficulty positions our framework as potential task difficulty evaluator. Our main contributions are listed as follows: We propose test-time rectify-or-reject pruning method that intercepts and iteratively corrects agent outputs to effectively block error propagation in MAS, thereby safeguarding task performance against cascading degradation. We construct failure-driven indicator pool by distilling error patterns from failed MAS trajectories, providing an off-the-shelf knowledge base that encapsu"

Abstract AgentDropoutV2 is a test-time framework that dynamically optimizes multi-agent system information flow through error correction and pruning mechanisms without requiring retraining.  					AI-generated summary While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel in complex reasoning, they suffer from the cascading impact of erroneous information generated by individual participants. Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns. Our code and dataset are released at https://github.com/TonySY2/AgentDropoutV2.

Abstract A deep learning framework called SMTL improves efficient long-horizon agentic search by replacing sequential reasoning with parallel evidence acquisition, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple research benchmarks while reducing reasoning steps by 70.7%.  					AI-generated summary Recent deep research agents primarily improve performance by scaling reasoning depth, but this leads to high inference cost and latency in search-intensive scenarios. Moreover, generalization across heterogeneous research settings remains challenging. In this work, we propose Search More, Think Less (SMTL), a framework for long-horizon agentic search that targets both efficiency and generalization. SMTL replaces sequential reasoning with parallel evidence acquisition, enabling efficient context management under constrained context budgets. To support generalization across task types, we further introduce a unified data synthesis pipeline that constructs search tasks spanning both deterministic question answering and open-ended research scenarios with task appropriate evaluation metrics. We train an end-to-end agent using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, achieving strong and often state of the art performance across benchmarks including BrowseComp (48.6\%), GAIA (75.7\%), Xbench (82.0\%), and DeepResearch Bench (45.9\%). Compared to Mirothinker-v1.0, SMTL with maximum 100 interaction steps reduces the average number of reasoning steps on BrowseComp by 70.7\%, while improving accuracy.

Abstract MediX-R1 presents an open-ended reinforcement learning framework for medical multimodal large language models that uses diverse reward signals and LLM-based evaluation to improve clinical reasoning beyond multiple-choice formats.  					AI-generated summary We introduce MediX-R1, an open-ended Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that enables clinically grounded, free-form answers beyond multiple-choice formats. MediX-R1 fine-tunes a baseline vision-language backbone with Group Based RL and a composite reward tailored for medical reasoning: an LLM-based accuracy reward that judges semantic correctness with a strict YES/NO decision, a medical embedding-based semantic reward to capture paraphrases and terminology variants, and lightweight format and modality rewards that enforce interpretable reasoning and modality recognition. This multi-signal design provides stable, informative feedback for open-ended outputs where traditional verifiable or MCQ-only rewards fall short. To measure progress, we propose a unified evaluation framework for both text-only and image+text tasks that uses a Reference-based LLM-as-judge in place of brittle string-overlap metrics, capturing semantic correctness, reasoning, and contextual alignment. Despite using only sim51K instruction examples, MediX-R1 achieves excellent results across standard medical LLM (text-only) and VLM (image + text) benchmarks, outperforming strong open-source baselines and delivering particularly large gains on open-ended clinical tasks. Our results demonstrate that open-ended RL with comprehensive reward signals and LLM-based evaluation is a practical path toward reliable medical reasoning in multimodal models. Our trained models, curated datasets and source code are available at https://medix.cvmbzuai.com

"Abstract MediX-R1 presents an open-ended reinforcement learning framework for medical multimodal large language models that uses diverse reward signals and LLM-based evaluation to improve clinical reasoning beyond multiple-choice formats.  					AI-generated summary We introduce MediX-R1, an open-ended Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that enables clinically grounded, free-form answers beyond multiple-choice formats. MediX-R1 fine-tunes a baseline vision-language backbone with Group Based RL and a composite reward tailored for medical reasoning: an LLM-based accuracy reward that judges semantic correctness with a strict YES/NO decision, a medical embedding-based semantic reward to capture paraphrases and terminology variants, and lightweight format and modality rewards that enforce interpretable reasoning and modality recognition. This multi-signal design provides stable, informative feedback for open-ended outputs where traditional verifiable or MCQ-only rewards fall short. To measure progress, we propose a unified evaluation framework for both text-only and image+text tasks that uses a Reference-based LLM-as-judge in place of brittle string-overlap metrics, capturing semantic correctness, reasoning, and contextual alignment. Despite using only sim51K instruction examples, MediX-R1 achieves excellent results across standard medical LLM (text-only) and VLM (image + text) benchmarks, outperforming strong open-source baselines and delivering particularly large gains on open-ended clinical tasks. Our results demonstrate that open-ended RL with comprehensive reward signals and LLM-based evaluation is a practical path toward reliable medical reasoning in multimodal models.
