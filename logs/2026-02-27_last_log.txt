Abstract MMHNet enables long-form audio generation from video by integrating hierarchical methods and non-causal Mamba, achieving superior performance over existing video-to-audio approaches.  					AI-generated summary Scaling multimodal alignment between video and audio is challenging, particularly due to limited data and the mismatch between text descriptions and frame-level video information. In this work, we tackle the scaling challenge in multimodal-to-audio generation, examining whether models trained on short instances can generalize to longer ones during testing. To tackle this challenge, we present multimodal hierarchical networks so-called MMHNet, an enhanced extension of state-of-the-art video-to-audio models. Our approach integrates a hierarchical method and non-causal Mamba to support long-form audio generation. Our proposed method significantly improves long audio generation up to more than 5 minutes. We also prove that training short and testing long is possible in the video-to-audio generation tasks without training on the longer durations. We show in our experiments that our proposed method could achieve remarkable results on long-video to audio benchmarks, beating prior works in video-to-audio tasks. Moreover, we showcase our model capability in generating more than 5 minutes, while prior video-to-audio methods fall short in generating with long durations.

  "desc": "MMHNet — это модель для генерации аудио из видео, которая использует иерархические методы и некаузальную архитектуру Mamba для обработки длинных видеозаписей. Ключевое преимущество модели в том, что она может генерировать аудио продолжительностью более 5 минут, обучаясь только на коротких примерах. Авторы решили проблему мультимодального выравнивания между видео и аудио, преодолев ограничения традиционных подходов, которые требуют обучения на данных нужной длины. Экспериментальные результаты показывают, что MMHNet значительно превосходит существующие методы синтеза аудио из видео по качеству и длительности генерируемых фрагментов.",
