By translating text descriptions or other input into detailed and diverse visuals, these models are reshaping both how machines interpret images and how new visual content is created. Leading methods in the ﬁeld include Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) [Doe16], Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [GPAM+20], and Diﬀusion models [HJA20]. Their advancements in producing high-resolution, high-ﬁdelity, and varied imagery have signiﬁcantly broadened the scope of visual generation, driving improvements in realism, diversity, and overall quality. The emergence of the Visual AutoRegressive model (VAR) [TJY+24] marks notable paradigm shift in image generation. Rather than relying on conventional next-token prediction, the VAR model introduces coarse-to-ﬁne next-scale prediction approach, enabling autoregressive transformers to more eﬃciently learn visual distributions and outperform diﬀusion-based"

Recently, Visual Autoregressive (VAR) Models introduced a groundbreaking advancement in the field of image generation, offering a scalable approach through a coarse-to-fine "next-scale prediction" paradigm. However, the state-of-the-art algorithm of VAR models in [Tian, Jiang, Yuan, Peng and Wang, NeurIPS 2024] takes O(n^4) time, which is computationally inefficient. In this work, we analyze the computational limits and efficiency criteria of VAR Models through a fine-grained complexity lens. Our key contribution is identifying the conditions under which VAR computations can achieve sub-quadratic time complexity. Specifically, we establish a critical threshold for the norm of input matrices used in VAR attention mechanisms. Above this threshold, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) from fine-grained complexity theory, a sub-quartic time algorithm for VAR models is impossible. To substantiate our theoretical findings, we present efficient constructions leveraging low-rank approximations that align with the derived criteria.

The pervasiveness of proprietary language models has raised critical privacy concerns, necessitating advancements in private inference (PI), where computations are performed directly on encrypted data without revealing users' sensitive information. While PI offers a promising solution, its practical deployment is hindered by substantial communication and latency overheads, primarily stemming from nonlinear operations. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to characterize the role of nonlinearities in decoder-only language models, laying a principled foundation for optimizing transformer-architectures tailored to the demands of PI.   By leveraging Shannon's entropy as a quantitative measure, we uncover the previously unexplored dual significance of nonlinearities: beyond ensuring training stability, they are crucial for maintaining attention head diversity. Specifically, we find that their removal triggers two critical failure modes: {\em entropy collapse} in deeper layers that destabilizes training, and {\em entropic overload} in earlier layers that leads to under-utilization of Multi-Head Attention's (MHA) representational capacity.   We propose an entropy-guided attention mechanism paired with a novel entropy regularization technique to mitigate entropic overload. Additionally, we explore PI-friendly alternatives to layer normalization for preventing entropy collapse and stabilizing the training of LLMs with reduced-nonlinearities. Our study bridges the gap between information theory and architectural design, establishing entropy dynamics as a principled guide for developing efficient PI architectures. The code and implementation are available at https://github.com/Nandan91/entropy-guided-attention-llm{entropy-guided-llm}.

"The pervasiveness of proprietary language models has raised critical privacy concerns, necessitating advancements in private inference (PI), where computations are performed directly on encrypted data without revealing users' sensitive information. While PI offers a promising solution, its practical deployment is hindered by substantial communication and latency overheads, primarily stemming from nonlinear operations. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to characterize the role of nonlinearities in decoder-only language models, laying a principled foundation for optimizing transformer-architectures tailored to the demands of PI.
