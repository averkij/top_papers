[ 1 3 5 4 5 0 . 1 0 5 2 : r An Empirical Study of Autoregressive Pre-training from Videos Jathushan Rajasegaran1,2, Ilija Radosavovic2, Rahul Ravishankar2, Yossi Gandelsman1,2, Christoph Feichtenhofer1, Jitendra Malik1,2 1Meta FAIR, 2UC Berkeley We empirically study autoregressive pre-training from videos. To perform our study, we construct series of autoregressive video models, called Toto. We treat videos as sequences of visual tokens and train transformer models to autoregressively predict future tokens. Our models are pre-trained on diverse dataset of videos and images comprising over 1 trillion visual tokens. We explore different architectural, training, and inference design choices. We evaluate the learned visual representations on range of downstream tasks including image recognition, video classification, object tracking, and robotics. Our results demonstrate that, despite minimal inductive biases, autoregressive pre-training leads to competitive performance across all benchmarks. Finally, we find that scaling our video models results in similar scaling curves to those seen in language models, albeit with different rate. Website: https://brjathu.github.io/toto In paper published in 1951, Shannon, having just published the foundational papers of information theory, proposed guessing game of next word prediction to estimate the entropy of English (Shannon, 1951). Nearly 70 years later, training high-capacity transformer network (Vaswani et al., 2017) on this task, provided the generative pre-training backbone for Large Language Models (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). Less well known is the fact that in 1954, Fred Attneave (Attneave, 1954) proposed an analog of Shannons task for images. To quote We may divide the picture into arbitrarily small elements which we transmit to subject (S) in cumulative sequence, having them guess at the color of each successive element until they are correct.

There is a widely-spread claim that GANs are difficult to train, and GAN architectures in the literature are littered with empirical tricks. We provide evidence against this claim and build a modern GAN baseline in a more principled manner. First, we derive a well-behaved regularized relativistic GAN loss that addresses issues of mode dropping and non-convergence that were previously tackled via a bag of ad-hoc tricks. We analyze our loss mathematically and prove that it admits local convergence guarantees, unlike most existing relativistic losses. Second, our new loss allows us to discard all ad-hoc tricks and replace outdated backbones used in common GANs with modern architectures. Using StyleGAN2 as an example, we present a roadmap of simplification and modernization that results in a new minimalist baseline -- R3GAN. Despite being simple, our approach surpasses StyleGAN2 on FFHQ, ImageNet, CIFAR, and Stacked MNIST datasets, and compares favorably against state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models.

"We empirically study autoregressive pre-training from videos. To perform our study, we construct a series of autoregressive video models, called Toto. We treat videos as sequences of visual tokens and train transformer models to autoregressively predict future tokens. Our models are pre-trained on a diverse dataset of videos and images comprising over 1 trillion visual tokens. We explore different architectural, training, and inference design choices. We evaluate the learned visual representations on a range of downstream tasks including image recognition, video classification, object tracking, and robotics. Our results demonstrate that, despite minimal inductive biases, autoregressive pre-training leads to competitive performance across all benchmarks. Finally, we find that scaling our video models results in similar scaling curves to those seen in language models, albeit with a different rate. More details at https://brjathu.github.io/toto/"
