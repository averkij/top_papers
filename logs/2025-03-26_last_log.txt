Text:"Overcoming Vocabulary Mismatch: Vocabulary-agnostic Teacher Guided Language Modeling Haebin Shin 1 2 * Lei Ji 1 Xiao Liu 1 Yeyun GongUsing large teacher models to guide the training of smaller student models has become the prevailing paradigm for efficient and effective learning. However, vocabulary mismatches between teacher and student language models pose significant challenges in language modeling, resulting in divergent token sequences and output distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Vocabulary-agnostic Teacher Guided Language Modeling (VocAgnoLM), novel approach that bridges the gap caused by vocabulary mismatch through two key methods: (1) Token-level Lexical Alignment, which aligns token sequences across mismatched vocabularies, and (2) Teacher Guided Loss, which leverages the loss of teacher model to guide effective student training. We demonstrate its effectiveness in language modeling with 1B student model using various 7B teacher models with different vocabularies. Notably, with Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct, teacher model sharing only about 6% of its vocabulary with TinyLlama, VocAgnoLM achieves 46% performance improvement compared to naive continual pretraining. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VocAgnoLM consistently benefits from stronger teacher models, providing robust solution to vocabulary mismatches in language modeling. 5 2 0 2 4 2 ] . [ 1 3 2 1 9 1 . 3 0 5 2 : r 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly adopted guidance from teacher models to enhance student LLM training. This paradigm has been instrumental in addressing critical challenges, such as compensating for the limited capacity of smaller models during pretraining (Gemma-Team *Work done during internship at Microsoft Research. 1Microsoft Research 2KAIST AI. Correspondence to: Haebin Shin <haebin.shin@kaist.ac.kr>, Lei Ji <leiji@microsoft.com>, Xiao Liu <xiao.liu.msrasia@microsoft.com>, Yeyun Gong <yegong@microsoft.com>. 1 Figure 1: Limitation in Utilizing Better LLMs as Teacher Models due to Vocabulary Mismatch: Qwen2.5-Math (Yang et al., 2024) outperforms Llemma (Azerbayev et al., 2024) on math evaluation suite, but shares only 6.32% of its vocabulary with the student model, TinyLlama (Zhang et al., 2024a). et al., 2024; Meta, 2024; Muralidharan et al., 2024), optimizing language modeling with carefully selected or curated data (Gu et al., 2024b; Lin et al., 2024), and providing task-specific on-policy guidance for downstream tasks (Gu et al., 2024a; Agarwal et al., 2024). By inheriting capabilities from more advanced models, student LLMs can refine their behaviors, align with specific objectives, and achieve substantial performance gains. Despite these advances, critical bottleneck remains: the vocabulary mismatch between teacher and student models. Most current methods assume identical vocabularies, limiting the student models ability to benefit from the latest state-of-the-art or domain-specialized teacher models with distinct tokenization schemes. This constraint not only prevents student models from leveraging diverse open-source LLMs but also imposes additional costs, such as the need to train customized teacher models or rely exclusively on large models with compatible vocabularies (Gu et al., 2024b; Lin et al., 2024). As illustrated in Figure 1, the vocabulary overlap ratio between Qwen (Qwen et al., 2024) and TinyLlama (Zhang et al., 2024a) is only 6.32%, despite Qwens strong performance. This disparity underscores Overcoming Vocabulary Mismatch: Vocabulary-agnostic Teacher Guided Language Modeling Figure 2: Overview of Vocabulary-agnostic Teacher Guided Language Modeling. Left: Teacher models (such as Qwen, Mistral, DeepSeek) produce token sequences that differ from those of the student model (TinyLlama), leading to misalignment. Middle: To address this, Token-level Lexical Mapping establishes one-to-many mapping from each student token to corresponding teacher tokens. Right: To overcome logit distribution divergence, the mapped teacher token loss is utilized to guide the training of the student model. how vocabulary mismatches severely limit the adoption of high-performing teacher models, creating an urgent need for approaches that transcend these restrictions. Given this mismatch, we analyze the tokenization discrepancy between different LLMs to observe two primary limitations: (1) token sequence mismatch and (2) logit distribution divergence. As illustrated in Figure 2, different LLMs tokenize the same input phrase "Probability, Uncertainty" into 4, 8, 6, and 7 tokens, respectively. This tokenization variability disrupts sequence alignment, complicating the student models ability to interpret the teacher models outputs. Furthermore, even if two models produce similar number of tokens, their logit distributions can vary significantly due to differences in architecture, training data, or optimization techniques. This makes it challenging to directly use teacher models logits as guidance for student model. To overcome these challenges, we propose simple yet effective approach, Token-level Lexical Alignment. Our method achieves token-level alignment in one-to-many manner, enabling student models to receive fine-grained guidance from teacher models without requiring additional training to unify vocabularies. By bridging the gap between differing vocabularies, Token-level Lexical Alignment allows the efficient integration of emerging teacher models and ensures the student model can effectively learn from teacher models guidance. Additionally, we introduce Teacher Guided Loss to leverage aligned tokens, allowing the student to benefit from the aligned teacher outputs, even when their logit distributions differ. We evaluate VocAgnoLM by continual pretraining TinyLLaMA 1.1B (Zhang et al., 2024a) using 7B teacher models built on different vocabulary system, such as Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), DeepSeek (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024), or Qwen2.5 (Qwen et al., 2024). Notably, using Qwen2.5Math-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024), which has only 6% vocabulary overlap with TinyLLaMA, VocAgnoLM achieves 46% performance improvement over naive continual pretraining baseline and 33% improvement over logit distribution mapping baseline. We highlight the effectiveness of vocabulary-agnostic distillation, enabling specialized teacher models to be directly utilized without vocabulary constraints. Our approach not only mitigates the vocabulary mismatch issue but also enhances the effi"

Using large teacher models to guide the training of smaller student models has become the prevailing paradigm for efficient and effective learning. However, vocabulary mismatches between teacher and student language models pose significant challenges in language modeling, resulting in divergent token sequences and output distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Vocabulary-agnostic Teacher Guided Language Modeling (VocAgnoLM), a novel approach that bridges the gap caused by vocabulary mismatch through two key methods: (1) Token-level Lexical Alignment, which aligns token sequences across mismatched vocabularies, and (2) Teacher Guided Loss, which leverages the loss of teacher model to guide effective student training. We demonstrate its effectiveness in language modeling with 1B student model using various 7B teacher models with different vocabularies. Notably, with Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct, a teacher model sharing only about 6% of its vocabulary with TinyLlama, VocAgnoLM achieves a 46% performance improvement compared to naive continual pretraining. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VocAgnoLM consistently benefits from stronger teacher models, providing a robust solution to vocabulary mismatches in language modeling.

We present a novel method for reconstructing personalized 3D human avatars with realistic animation from only a few images. Due to the large variations in body shapes, poses, and cloth types, existing methods mostly require hours of per-subject optimization during inference, which limits their practical applications. In contrast, we learn a universal prior from over a thousand clothed humans to achieve instant feedforward generation and zero-shot generalization. Specifically, instead of rigging the avatar with shared skinning weights, we jointly infer personalized avatar shape, skinning weights, and pose-dependent deformations, which effectively improves overall geometric fidelity and reduces deformation artifacts. Moreover, to normalize pose variations and resolve coupled ambiguity between canonical shapes and skinning weights, we design a 3D canonicalization process to produce pixel-aligned initial conditions, which helps to reconstruct fine-grained geometric details. We then propose a multi-frame feature aggregation to robustly reduce artifacts introduced in canonicalization and fuse a plausible avatar preserving person-specific identities. Finally, we train the model in an end-to-end framework on a large-scale capture dataset, which contains diverse human subjects paired with high-quality 3D scans. Extensive experiments show that our method generates more authentic reconstruction and animation than state-of-the-arts, and can be directly generalized to inputs from casually taken phone photos.
