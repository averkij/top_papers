Leveraging step-by-step reasoning has shown substantial improvements in solving complex tasks by explicitly providing models with intermediate reasoning steps(Lightman et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023), significantly enhancing accuracy. In recent years, the performance improvements of language models have largely depended on massive-scale self-supervised pre-training (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022), scaling up training-time compute. However, as advancements in training-time scaling slow, increasing attention is turning towards scaling up test-time compute (Muennighoff et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025). OpenAI (OpenAI, 2024a) pioneered this approach with their o1 series models (OpenAI, 2024b) using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). DeepSeek further advanced test-time scaling by introducing the DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025), successfully achieving performance comparable to OpenAIs o1 series. Prior approaches in inference test-time compute have included majority voting methods and external reward-based best-of-N strategies (Levi, 2024; Diao et al., 2024). Unlike repetitive sampling, sequential expansion approaches enable models to iteratively refine attempts based on prior outcomes. Many researchers have attempted to replicate or extend their methods, employing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Zhou et al., 2024; Choi et al., 2023), multi-agent approaches (Qin et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025), some work based on Process Reward Model(PRM) (Wang et al., 2024; Lightman et al., 2023). Despite these successes, existing methods exhibit critical limitations. PRM face challenges such as defining fine-grained reasoning steps clearly, verifying intermediate reasoning correctness, and mitigating reward hacking (Amodei et al., 2016; Langosco et al., 2023), making automated labeling challenging and manual labeling impractical for scaling. Similarly, MCTS methods encounter difficulties due to vast search spaces, often causing models to become trapped in local optima, and depend heavily on sophisticated scoring models that are challenging to train (DeepSeek-AI, 2025). Addressing these issues, DeepSeek introduced rule-based reward system combined with large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), enabling clearer guidance and promoting model self-reflection and deeper reasoning (DeepSeek-AI, 2025). However, consistently identifying optimal reasoning paths remains challenging. Inspired by human cognitive behaviors, we propose novel test-time scaling strategy named Multi-round Thinking. This method allows the model to iteratively reconsider previous answers independently, using only the final answer from previous rounds as input prompts, discarding prior reasoning steps. This approach 2 parallels human cognitive processes, breaking cognitive inertia and enabling the model to correct entrenched reasoning errors. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this intuitive approach. For example, using the DeepSeek-R1 model (DeepSeek-AI, 2025), performance improvements were observed across multiple benchmarks: on AIME 2024 (MAA, 2024), pass@1 increased from 79.7% (Round 1) to 82.0% (Round 2); on GPQA-Diamond (Rein et al., 2023), it rose from 74.0% to 74.8%; and on LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2024), performance improved from 65.3% to 67.1%. These findings underscore the substantial potential of iterative thinking for further exploiting the benefits of test-time scaling.We introduce novel Multi-round Thinking approach designed to significantly enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). In contrast to traditional single-step reasoning methods, our approach iteratively refines answers through multiple rounds of inference. Each round takes the answer from the previous iteration (without intermediate reasoning steps) as part of new input prompt, encouraging independent reconsideration and correction. This iterative process helps models avoid cognitive inertia, analogous to human strategies in overcoming entrenched errors in reasoning. The Multi-round Thinking methodology operates explicitly as follows: Given an original user prompt Puser, the inference and refinement process proceeds iteratively: Initial Round (Round 1): The language model receives the initial prompt and generates the first round of reasoning and final answer: (Puser) {T hinking1, Answer1} (1) Subsequent Rounds (Round n, 2): In each subsequent inference round, intermediate reasoning traces (T hinkingn1) from the previous iteration are discarded, retaining"

Pre-trained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong visual representations for a wide range of applications. In this paper, we continually pre-train prevailing VFMs in a multimodal manner such that they can effortlessly process visual inputs of varying sizes and produce visual representations that are more aligned with language representations, regardless of their original pre-training process. To this end, we introduce CoMP, a carefully designed multimodal pre-training pipeline. CoMP uses a Continual Rotary Position Embedding to support native resolution continual pre-training, and an Alignment Loss between visual and textual features through language prototypes to align multimodal representations. By three-stage training, our VFMs achieve remarkable improvements not only in multimodal understanding but also in other downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation. Remarkably, CoMP-SigLIP achieves scores of 66.7 on ChartQA and 75.9 on DocVQA with a 0.5B LLM, while maintaining an 87.4% accuracy on ImageNet-1K and a 49.5 mIoU on ADE20K under frozen chunk evaluation.

The hallucination of large multimodal models (LMMs), providing responses that appear correct but are actually incorrect, limits their reliability and applicability. This paper aims to study the hallucination problem of LMMs in video modality, which is dynamic and more challenging compared to static modalities like images and text. From this motivation, we first present a comprehensive benchmark termed HAVEN for evaluating hallucinations of LMMs in video understanding tasks. It is built upon three dimensions, i.e., hallucination causes, hallucination aspects, and question formats, resulting in 6K questions. Then, we quantitatively study 7 influential factors on hallucinations, e.g., duration time of videos, model sizes, and model reasoning, via experiments of 16 LMMs on the presented benchmark. In addition, inspired by recent thinking models like OpenAI o1, we propose a video-thinking model to mitigate the hallucinations of LMMs via supervised reasoning fine-tuning (SRFT) and direct preference optimization (TDPO)-- where SRFT enhances reasoning capabilities while TDPO reduces hallucinations in the thinking process. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness. Remarkably, it improves the baseline by 7.65% in accuracy on hallucination evaluation and reduces the bias score by 4.5%. The code and data are public at https://github.com/Hongcheng-Gao/HAVEN.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated the effectiveness of test-time scaling, where extended reasoning processes substantially enhance model performance. Despite this, current models are constrained by limitations in handling long texts and reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective test-time scaling approach Multi-round Thinking. This method iteratively refines model reasoning by leveraging previous answers as prompts for subsequent rounds. Extensive experiments across multiple models, including QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1, consistently show performance improvements on various benchmarks such as AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA-diamond, and LiveCodeBench. For instance, the accuracy of QwQ-32B improved from 80.3% (Round 1) to 82.1% (Round 2) on the AIME 2024 dataset, while DeepSeek-R1 showed a similar increase from 79.7% to 82.0%.

"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated the effectiveness of test-time scaling, where extended reasoning processes substantially enhance model performance. Despite this, current models are constrained by limitations in handling long texts and reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective test-time scaling approach Multi-round Thinking. This method iteratively refines model reasoning by leveraging previous answers as prompts for subsequent rounds. Extensive experiments across multiple models, including QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1, consistently show performance improvements on various benchmarks such as AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA-diamond, and LiveCodeBench. For instance, the accuracy of QwQ-32B improved from 80.3% (Round 1) to 82.1% (Round 2) on the AIME 2024 dataset, while DeepSeek-R1 showed a similar increase from 79.7% to 82.0%. These results confirm that Multi-round Thinking is a broadly applicable, straightforward approach to achieving stable enhancements in model performance, underscoring its potential for future developments in test-time scaling techniques. The key prompt: {Original question prompt} The assistant's previous answer is: <answer> {last round answer} </answer>, and please re-answer."

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in reasoning, exemplified by the success of OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. However, integrating reasoning with external search processes remains challenging, especially for complex multi-hop questions requiring multiple retrieval steps. We propose ReSearch, a novel framework that trains LLMs to Reason with Search via reinforcement learning without using any supervised data on reasoning steps. Our approach treats search operations as integral components of the reasoning chain, where when and how to perform searches is guided by text-based thinking, and search results subsequently influence further reasoning. We train ReSearch on Qwen2.5-7B(-Instruct) and Qwen2.5-32B(-Instruct) models and conduct extensive experiments. Despite being trained on only one dataset, our models demonstrate strong generalizability across various benchmarks. Analysis reveals that ReSearch naturally elicits advanced reasoning capabilities such as reflection and self-correction during the reinforcement learning process.

In this paper, we propose LSRNA, a novel framework for higher-resolution (exceeding 1K) image generation using diffusion models by leveraging super-resolution directly in the latent space. Existing diffusion models struggle with scaling beyond their training resolutions, often leading to structural distortions or content repetition. Reference-based methods address the issues by upsampling a low-resolution reference to guide higher-resolution generation. However, they face significant challenges: upsampling in latent space often causes manifold deviation, which degrades output quality. On the other hand, upsampling in RGB space tends to produce overly smoothed outputs. To overcome these limitations, LSRNA combines Latent space Super-Resolution (LSR) for manifold alignment and Region-wise Noise Addition (RNA) to enhance high-frequency details. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating LSRNA outperforms state-of-the-art reference-based methods across various resolutions and metrics, while showing the critical role of latent space upsampling in preserving detail and sharpness. The code is available at https://github.com/3587jjh/LSRNA.
