[ 1 1 9 2 7 0 . 5 0 5 2 : r INTELLECT-2: Reasoning Model Trained Through Globally Decentralized Reinforcement Learning Prime Intellect Team Sami Jaghouar Justus Mattern Jack Min Ong Jannik Straube Manveer Basra Aaron Pazdera Kushal Thaman Matthew Di Ferrante Felix Gabriel Fares Obeid Kemal Erdem Michael Keiblinger Johannes HagemannWe introduce INTELLECT-2, the first globally distributed reinforcement learning (RL) training run of 32 billion parameter language model. Unlike traditional centralized training efforts, INTELLECT-2 trains reasoning model using fully asynchronous RL across dynamic, heterogeneous swarm of permissionless compute contributors. To enable training run with this unique infrastructure, we built various components from scratch: we introduce PRIME-RL, our training framework purpose-built for distributed asynchronous reinforcement learning, based on top of novel components such as TOPLOC, which verifies rollouts from untrusted inference workers, and SHARDCAST, which efficiently broadcasts policy weights from training nodes to inference workers. Beyond infrastructure components, we propose modifications to the standard GRPO training recipe and data filtering techniques that were crucial to achieve training stability and ensure that our model successfully learned its training objective, thus improving upon QwQ-32B, the state of the art reasoning model in the 32B parameter range. We open-source INTELLECT-2 along with all of our code and data, hoping to encourage and enable more open research in the field of decentralized training.1 Introduction 2 Training Infrastructure 2.1 PRIME-RL: Framework for Distributed Asynchronous Reinforcement Learning .. 2.1.2 Inference .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.2 SHARDCAST: Efficient Policy Weight Broadcasts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .2.3 TOPLOC: Enabling Trustless Inference . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.3.1 Computation checks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.3.2 Sampling checks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.3.3 Sanity checks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.4 The Prime Intellect Protocol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.4.1 System Architecture . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.4.2 Operational Flows . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 6 7 7 8 8 8 2.4.3 Design Trade-offs & Limitations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 3 Training Recipe 3.1 Training Data & Rewards . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.1.1 Task Rewards . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.1.2 Length Rewards . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.2 Asynchronous Reinforcement Learning . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.3 Offline & Online Data Filtering . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.3.1 Offline Data Filtering . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."

We introduce INTELLECT-2, the first globally distributed reinforcement learning (RL) training run of a 32 billion parameter language model. Unlike traditional centralized training efforts, INTELLECT-2 trains a reasoning model using fully asynchronous RL across a dynamic, heterogeneous swarm of permissionless compute contributors.   To enable a training run with this unique infrastructure, we built various components from scratch: we introduce PRIME-RL, our training framework purpose-built for distributed asynchronous reinforcement learning, based on top of novel components such as TOPLOC, which verifies rollouts from untrusted inference workers, and SHARDCAST, which efficiently broadcasts policy weights from training nodes to inference workers.   Beyond infrastructure components, we propose modifications to the standard GRPO training recipe and data filtering techniques that were crucial to achieve training stability and ensure that our model successfully learned its training objective, thus improving upon QwQ-32B, the state of the art reasoning model in the 32B parameter range.   We open-source INTELLECT-2 along with all of our code and data, hoping to encourage and enable more open research in the field of decentralized training.
