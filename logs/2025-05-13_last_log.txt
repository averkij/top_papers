Text:"MonetGPT: Solving Puzzles Enhances MLLMs Image Retouching Skills NILADRI SHEKHAR DUTT, University College London, UK DUYGU CEYLAN, Adobe Research, UK NILOY J. MITRA, University College London, Adobe Research, UK 5 2 0 2 9 ] . [ 1 6 7 1 6 0 . 5 0 5 2 : r Fig. 1. We present MonetGPT, an image operation-aware multimodal large language model (MLLM), that provides automatic suggestions for image retouching. Given photograph (left), MonetGPT analyzes it to identify set of issues and possible adjustments to fix them. The solution steps are then translated to set of procedural operations, along with respective parameter settings, drawing from given library of operations, which occurs in three stages. (Visual puzzles, on which we train the MLLM, are not shown here.) Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs. Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides new tool accessible to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp, Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals. Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In this paper, we ask if multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them with given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing operations, by training them to solve specially-designed visual puzzles. Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit sequences. To facilitate training, given set of expert-edited photos, we synthesize reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits and then grounding pretrained LLM on the visua"

Introduction As Generative AI (GenAI) models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) become ever more important to the field and to the world at large, it has become clear that performing empirical evaluation of these models and methods is extremely difficult to do in rigorous and comprehensive way. This difficulty is of course not due to lack of effort or expertise by researchers. Indeed, enormous effort and resources have been poured into creating myriad benchmarks and test cases (Chiang et al., 2024b; Fourrier et al., 2024; 1Work done at Kaggle 2Kaggle, Inc. Correspondence to: D. Sculley <d@sculley.ai>, Nate Keating <natekeating@kaggle.com>, Megan Risdal <meg@kaggle.com>. Hendrycks et al., 2021; Cobbe et al., 2021; Zellers et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021b). However, even accounting for these many important efforts and achievements, our position is that the current state of evaluation is insufficient to meet the needs of this moment in GenAI for the field and for the world. In our view, the root cause of this insufficiency is that the evaluation needs of GenAI models fundamentally break the paradigm of traditional benchmarking that served the field of machine learning (ML) so well during decades of remarkable progress. This breakage goes beyond the familiar difficulty of defining what, exactly, is in the training data for an LLM. In our view, we need broader conception of generalization for GenAI that moves beyond the idea of generalizing to new independently drawn examples from stationary distribution, and instead refers to performing well on tasks that are entirely novel from models perspective. This higher bar is rooted in commonsense standards for human intelligence (Chollet, 2019; Dennett, 1991), but has far reaching consequences, most notably that it implies that the problems of data leakage and contamination in evaluation are the most pressing concerns. Together, these factors imply that rigorous and robust evaluation GenAI models requires steady source of novel tasks structured to avoids leakage, contamination, and other forms of inadvertent cheating. Fortunately, AI Competitionssuch as those hosted on Kaggle and similar platformsoffer ready-made solution, providing continual source of new tasks for evaluation and significant structures to avoid leakage and related issues. 1.1. Summarizing Our Position Our position can be summarized by the following points: Traditional paradigms for ML evaluation are illequipped to meet the demands of GenAI Evaluation. Leakage should be viewed by the field as the most important pitfall to avoid in evaluations. GenAI evaluations should be considered leaked the moment it has been shared online or sent over the wire. 1 AI Competitions Provide the Gold Standard for Empirical Rigor in GenAI Evaluation If we have to choose between reproducibility and robustness in GenAI evaluations, we should choose to prioritize robustness. We should replace the notion of reproducible static benchmarks with repeatable processes and procedures. The field should use established AI Competitions platforms as renewable stream of novel evaluation tasks. The standards and practices developed that help AI Competitions guard against cheating should be viewed by the field as the gold standard for empirical rigor in evaluation. Meta-analyses should be valued as highly in the field of AI as they are in fields such as medicine. 1.2. Structure of this paper In the remainder of this paper, we will first review the most typical structure and assumptions in traditional ML evaluation and discuss why it is insufficient for GenAI evaluations. We will examine the nature of generalization for GenAI, how this leads to specific concerns around leakage, and additionally show how goals of reproducibility and robustness in evaluation may be fundamentally at odds. We will then show how difficult the problem of leakage is even for traditional ML evaluations with some brief case studies, and look at current GenAI benchmarks that are aiming to overcome leakage and contamination. We finish with an examination of the ways that AI Competitions address these issues, discuss our recommendations, and examine alternate viewpoints. Our goal is to provide convincing support of the view that AI Competitions do indeed provide gold standard for empirical rigor in evaluating GenAI models, and that the field should place accordingly high value and attention on their results. 2. Background: Revisiting Benchmarking Traditional ML benchmarking has been founded on the idea of test-train split, in which an evaluation is structured by training model from scratch on given portion of training data and then evaluating that trained model on holdout set of test data (Mitchell, 1997). This conceptual structure is so fundamental to modern ML practice that it may sometimes be taken for granted and not carefully examined. So let us take moment to reflect this basic structure and its implications. In classical supervised ML, the most common traditional setup is to evaluate m"

Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs. Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp, Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals. Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In this paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them with a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing operations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles. Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit sequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we synthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits and then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize reasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by construction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and resolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a variety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and identity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural alternatives.

In this position paper, we observe that empirical evaluation in Generative AI is at a crisis point since traditional ML evaluation and benchmarking strategies are insufficient to meet the needs of evaluating modern GenAI models and systems. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that these models typically have nearly unbounded input and output spaces, typically do not have a well defined ground truth target, and typically exhibit strong feedback loops and prediction dependence based on context of previous model outputs. On top of these critical issues, we argue that the problems of {\em leakage} and {\em contamination} are in fact the most important and difficult issues to address for GenAI evaluations. Interestingly, the field of AI Competitions has developed effective measures and practices to combat leakage for the purpose of counteracting cheating by bad actors within a competition setting. This makes AI Competitions an especially valuable (but underutilized) resource. Now is time for the field to view AI Competitions as the gold standard for empirical rigor in GenAI evaluation, and to harness and harvest their results with according value.

"In this position paper, we observe that empirical evaluation in Generative AI is at a crisis point since traditional ML evaluation and benchmarking strategies are insufficient to meet the needs of evaluating modern GenAI models and systems. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that these models typically have nearly unbounded input and output spaces, typically do not have a well defined ground truth target, and typically exhibit strong feedback loops and prediction dependence based on context of previous model outputs. On top of these critical issues, we argue that the problems of {\em leakage} and {\em contamination} are in fact the most important and difficult issues to address for GenAI evaluations. Interestingly, the field of AI Competitions has developed effective measures and practices to combat leakage for the purpose of counteracting cheating by bad actors within a competition setting. This makes AI Competitions an especially valuable (but underutilized) resource. Now is time for the field to view AI Competitions as the gold standard for empirical rigor in GenAI evaluation, and to harness and harvest their results with according value."
