Text:"MiMo: Unlocking the Reasoning Potential of Language Model From Pretraining to Posttraining Xiaomi LLM-Core TeamWe present MiMo-7B, large language model born for reasoning tasks, with optimization across both pre-training and post-training stages. During pre-training, we enhance the data preprocessing pipeline and employ three-stage data mixing strategy to strengthen the base models reasoning potential. MiMo-7B-Base is pre-trained on 25 trillion tokens, with additional MultiToken Prediction objective for enhanced performance and accelerated inference speed. During post-training, we curate dataset of 130K verifiable mathematics and programming problems for reinforcement learning, integrating test-difficultydriven code-reward scheme to alleviate sparse-reward issues and employing strategic data resampling to stabilize training. Extensive evaluations show that MiMo-7B-Base possesses exceptional reasoning potential, outperforming even much larger 32B models.

In this work, we explore the learning dynamics throughout the CPT process for large language models. We specifically focus on how general and downstream domain performance evolves at each training step, with domain performance measured via validation losses. We have observed that the CPT loss curve fundamentally characterizes the transition from one curve to another hidden curve, and could be described by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and learning rate annealing. We derive CPT scaling law that combines the two factors, enabling the prediction of loss at any (continual) training steps and across learning rate schedules (LRS) in CPT. Our formulation presents comprehensive understanding of several critical factors in CPT, including loss potential, peak learning rate, training steps, replay ratio, etc. Moreover, our approach can be adapted to customize training hyper-parameters to different CPT goals such as balancing general and domain-specific performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scaling law holds across various CPT datasets and training hyperparameters. 1. Introduction In recent years, large language models (LLMs) exhibit versatile abilities and have garnered significant academic and industrial attention (Dubey et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2023). Continual Pre-Training (CPT) of LLMs aims to enhance 1School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China 2State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China 3Ritzz-AI.

Copyright 2025 by the author(s). the LLMs abilities in specific downstream domains (e.g. coding, finance, math, etc.) while mitigating the substantial costs associated with re-training (Chen et al., 2023a; agatay Yıldız et al., 2024; Ibrahim et al., 2024). CPT primarily focuses on the evolution of performance across general and downstream domains. It is widely observed and believed that improvements on downstream datasets may come at the expense of performance on general domain tasks, or the well-known catastrophic forgetting (French, 1999; Gupta et al., 2023). Recently, some scaling laws for transfer are proposed in continual pre-training scenarios. For example, Hernandez et al. (2021b) and Barnett (2024) discover law to describe how effective data transferred scales with fine-tuning dataset size and model size. Que et al. (2024) and Gu et al. (2024) propose law to find the optimal replay ratio to balance general and downstream performances. However, very few studies have attempted to quantitatively describe the learning dynamics, particularly many performance variations on general and downstream domains throughout the CPT process. We have two primary research questions (RQs): (1) Can we find such an accurate law containing as many variables that affect the final CPT performance as possible? (2) Can we trace the performance of LLMs throughout CPT process, rather than only final performance like previous works? Studying the first RQ helps researchers clarify the various factors that affect CPT performance and then optimize hyper-parameters through prediction; Studying the second RQ helps community understand the learning dynamics of LLMs at each step of the CPT process, providing deeper insights and theoretical guidance for subsequent CPT research. Following previous works (Gupta et al., 2023; Ibrahim et al., 2024; Que et al., 2024), we trace performance changes using validation loss of the corresponding domains. We find that the CPT loss curve is transfer curve and can be described by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and LR annealing. stronger distribution shift leads to more pronounced deviation in the transfer loss curve while LR annealing results in the local loss drop in both PT and CPT phase. By pilot observation and experimental verification, we discover CPT scaling law that integrates the two factors, enabling fitting and predicting ground-truth loss changes. Learning Dynamics in Continual Pre-Training for Large Language Models (a) Constant PT and CPT LRS. (b) Dpt (FineWeb) Validation Loss. (c) Dcpt (Knowledge Pile) Validation Loss. (d) WSD PT and CPT LRS. (e) Dpt (FineWeb) Validation Loss. (f) Dcpt (Knowledge Pile) Validation Loss. Figure 1. The CPT loss curves of different learning rate schedules (LRS) (constant and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) (Hu et al., 2024)), which are both transfer curve from the hidden PT curve training on Dpt (Blue dashed) to the hidden PT curve training on Dcpt (Orange dashed). The hidden PT curve training on Dcpt is the boundary of transfer curve in both Dpt and Dcpt validation loss. Our proposed scaling law provides comprehensive modeling and understanding of key CPT dynamics variables, such as loss potential, peak LR, training steps, replay ratio, etc. Loss potential refers to the potential of future loss drop via LR annealing and we will explain it in detail later. Moreover, our scaling law demonstrates how they jointly affect the performance of the final model at each CPT step, and guides how to optimize the model by adjusting these factors. In the process of deriving and applying our scaling law, many valuable conclusions are found. For example, (1) PT models with higher loss potential can better adapt to the downstream domain; (2) The performance of general domain would inevitably degrade if turning length becomes infinitely large, meaning that general pre-training is quite adequate or distribution shift is very large; (3) Fundamentally, towards specific goals, our scaling law is able to predict the optimal training hyper-parameters such as loss potential of PT models, peak LR, PT dataset replay ratio, etc. 2. Pilot Observation 2.1. Task Formulation We investigate the dynamics of performance in both general and downstream domains during the CPT process. Following previous works (Ibrahim et al., 2024; Que et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2024; Hernandez et al., 2021a), we assess th"

Text:"Step1X-3D: Towards High-Fidelity and Controllable Generation of Textured 3D Assets Step1X-3D Team & LightIllusions Team StepFun & LightIllusions https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step1X-3DWhile generative artificial intelligence has advanced significantly across text, image, audio, and video domains, 3D generation remains comparatively underdeveloped due to fundamental challenges such as data scarcity, algorithmic limitations, and ecosystem fragmentation. To this end, we present Step1X-3D, an open framework addressing these challenges through: (1) rigorous data curation pipeline processing >5M assets to create 2M high-quality dataset with standardized geometric and textural properties; (2) two-stage 3D-native architecture combining hybrid VAE-DiT geometry generator with an diffusion-based texture synthesis module; and (3) the full open-source release of models, training code, and adaptation modules. For geometry generation, the hybrid VAE-DiT component produces TSDF representations by employing perceiver-based latent encoding with sharp edge sampling for detail preservation. The diffusion-based texture synthesis module then ensures cross-view consistency through geometric conditioning and latent-space synchronization. Benchmark results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance that exceeds existing open-source methods, while also achieving competitive quality with proprietary solutions. Notably, the framework uniquely bridges the 2D and 3D generation paradigms by supporting direct transfer of 2D control techniques (e.g., LoRA) to 3D synthesis. By simultaneously advancing data quality, algorithmic fidelity, and reproducibility, Step1X-3D aims to establish new standards for open research in controllable 3D asset generation. 5 2 0 2 2 1 ] . [ 1 7 4 7 7 0 . 5 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Step1X-3D demonstrates the capability to generate 3D assets with high-fidelity geometry and versatile texture maps, while maintaining exceptional alignment between surface geometry and texture mapping. From left to right, we sequentially present: the base geometry (untextured), followed by cartoon-style, sketch-style, and photorealistic 3D asset generation results.In recent years, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technology has achieved remarkable development across five primary domains: text [1, 73, 42, 35], image [23, 62, 60, 33, 28, 22, 44], audio [76, 26, 19], video [46, 51, 75], and 3D content [54, 32, 31, 55, 24, 92]. However, unlike these other modalities, 3D generation technology exhibits significantly lower maturity and slower development progress, remaining far from production-ready. To facilitate further advancements in the field of 3D generation, we analyze the main challenges of 3D content generation from the respective datasets, algorithms, and their corresponding technological ecosystems. Firstly, data scarcity constitutes the primary bottleneck in 3D generation advancement, where utility is governed by both quantity and quality. Current open-source datasets with >10K samples are limited to ShapeNet [6] (51K), Objaverse [18] (800K) , and Objaverse-XL [17](10.2M). Although Objaverse-XL exceeds 10M samples, its web-sourced provenance results in unavoidable quality heterogeneity. Secondly, the inherent complexity of 3D representationswhere geometry and texture are decoupledrenders quality assessment fundamentally more challenging than in other modalities. Finally, despite rapid advances, the 3D generation ecosystem remains underdeveloped, with growing gap between opensource [38, 85, 94] and proprietary solutions. For instance, an open-source model like Trellis [85] suffers from limited generalization due to its 500K-scale training dataset. Meanwhile, the release strategy for some advanced models, like Hunyuan3D 2.0 [71], providing only pre-trained weights (without training code), can restrict fine-tuning. Furthermore, these models often lack the conditional generation support typically found in commercial platforms like Tripo and Rodin. These challenges in data availability, reproducibility, and controllability significantly impede progress in 3D generation technologies. To address this disparity, we introduce Step1X-3D, 3D native framework that combines advanced data curation with an innovative two-stage architecture as shown in Fig. 2. Our goal is to achieve high-fidelity, controllable 3D asset generation while championing reproducibility through the open release of curated data and training methodologies. The Step1X-3D data pipeline begins with over 5M 3D assets sourced from public datasets (e.g., Objaverse [18], Objaverse-XL [17], and etc) and proprietary collections. These assets undergo rigorous multi-stage refinement process: first, lowquality textures are eliminated based on criteria like resolution, normal map accuracy, material transparency, and surface complexity; second, watertight mesh conversions are enforced to ensure geometric consistency for robust training supervision. This process yields curated dataset of 2M high-quality assets, subset of which (alomost 800K assets derived from public data) will be openly released. Architecturally, Step1X-3D employs: (1) geometry generation stage using hybrid 3D VAE-DiT diffusion model to produce Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) (later meshed via marching cubes), and (2) texture synthesis stage leveraging an SD-XL-fine-tuned multi-view generator. This generator conditions on the produced geometry and input images to produce viewconsistent textures that are then baked onto the mesh. This integrated approach aims to advance the field by simultaneously resolving critical challenges in data quality, geometric precision, and texture fidelity, while establishing new benchmarks for open, reproducible research in 3D generation. The Step1X-3D geometry generation framework employs latent vector set representation [91] to encode point clouds into compact latent space, which is decoded into TSDF through scalable perceiver-based encoder-decoder [29, 95] architecture. To preserve high-frequency geometric details, we incorporate sharp edge sampling and integrate dual cross attention mechanisms derived from DoRA [9]. For the diffusion backbone, we adapt the state-of-the-art MMDiT architecture from FLUX [33] originally developed for text-to-image generation by modifying its transformer layers to process our 1D latent space. This VAE-Diffusion hybrid design, architecturally analogous to contemporary 2D generative systems, facilitates direct transfe"

We present MiMo-7B, a large language model born for reasoning tasks, with optimization across both pre-training and post-training stages. During pre-training, we enhance the data preprocessing pipeline and employ a three-stage data mixing strategy to strengthen the base model's reasoning potential. MiMo-7B-Base is pre-trained on 25 trillion tokens, with additional Multi-Token Prediction objective for enhanced performance and accelerated inference speed. During post-training, we curate a dataset of 130K verifiable mathematics and programming problems for reinforcement learning, integrating a test-difficulty-driven code-reward scheme to alleviate sparse-reward issues and employing strategic data resampling to stabilize training. Extensive evaluations show that MiMo-7B-Base possesses exceptional reasoning potential, outperforming even much larger 32B models. The final RL-tuned model, MiMo-7B-RL, achieves superior performance on mathematics, code and general reasoning tasks, surpassing the performance of OpenAI o1-mini. The model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/xiaomimimo/MiMo.

Continual Pre-Training (CPT) has become a popular and effective method to apply strong foundation models to specific downstream tasks. In this work, we explore the learning dynamics throughout the CPT process for large language models. We specifically focus on how general and downstream domain performance evolves at each training step, with domain performance measured via validation losses. We have observed that the CPT loss curve fundamentally characterizes the transition from one curve to another hidden curve, and could be described by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and learning rate annealing. We derive a CPT scaling law that combines the two factors, enabling the prediction of loss at any (continual) training steps and across learning rate schedules (LRS) in CPT. Our formulation presents a comprehensive understanding of several critical factors in CPT, including loss potential, peak learning rate, training steps, replay ratio, etc. Moreover, our approach can be adapted to customize training hyper-parameters to different CPT goals such as balancing general and domain-specific performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scaling law holds across various CPT datasets and training hyper-parameters.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a common strategy to reduce hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL) can enable LLMs to act as search agents by activating retrieval capabilities, existing ones often underutilize their internal knowledge. This can lead to redundant retrievals, potential harmful knowledge conflicts, and increased inference latency. To address these limitations, an efficient and adaptive search agent capable of discerning optimal retrieval timing and synergistically integrating parametric (internal) and retrieved (external) knowledge is in urgent need. This paper introduces the Reinforced Internal-External Knowledge Synergistic Reasoning Agent (IKEA), which could indentify its own knowledge boundary and prioritize the utilization of internal knowledge, resorting to external search only when internal knowledge is deemed insufficient. This is achieved using a novel knowledge-boundary aware reward function and a knowledge-boundary aware training dataset. These are designed for internal-external knowledge synergy oriented RL, incentivizing the model to deliver accurate answers, minimize unnecessary retrievals, and encourage appropriate external searches when its own knowledge is lacking. Evaluations across multiple knowledge reasoning tasks demonstrate that IKEA significantly outperforms baseline methods, reduces retrieval frequency significantly, and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a common strategy to reduce hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL) can enable LLMs to act as search agents by activating retrieval capabilities, existing ones often underutilize their internal knowledge. This can lead to redundant retrievals, potential harmful knowledge conflicts, and increased inference latency. To address these limitations, an efficient and adaptive search agent capable of discerning optimal retrieval timing and synergistically integrating parametric (internal) and retrieved (external) knowledge is in urgent need. This paper introduces the Reinforced Internal-External Knowledge Synergistic Reasoning Agent (IKEA), which could indentify its own knowledge boundary and prioritize the utilization of internal knowledge, resorting to external search only when internal knowledge is deemed insufficient. This is achieved using a novel knowledge-boundary aware reward function and a knowledge-boundary aware training dataset. These are designed for internal-external knowledge synergy oriented RL, incentivizing the model to deliver accurate answers, minimize unnecessary retrievals, and encourage appropriate external searches when its own knowledge is lacking. Evaluations across multiple knowledge reasoning tasks demonstrate that IKEA significantly outperforms baseline methods, reduces retrieval frequency significantly, and exhibits robust generalization capabilities."

Recent breakthroughs in generative models-particularly diffusion models and rectified flows-have revolutionized visual content creation, yet aligning model outputs with human preferences remains a critical challenge. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for visual generation face critical limitations: incompatibility with modern Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)-based sampling paradigms, instability in large-scale training, and lack of validation for video generation. This paper introduces DanceGRPO, the first unified framework to adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to visual generation paradigms, unleashing one unified RL algorithm across two generative paradigms (diffusion models and rectified flows), three tasks (text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video), four foundation models (Stable Diffusion, HunyuanVideo, FLUX, SkyReel-I2V), and five reward models (image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary reward). To our knowledge, DanceGRPO is the first RL-based unified framework capable of seamless adaptation across diverse generative paradigms, tasks, foundational models, and reward models. DanceGRPO demonstrates consistent and substantial improvements, which outperform baselines by up to 181% on benchmarks such as HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Notably, DanceGRPO not only can stabilize policy optimization for complex video generation, but also enables generative policy to better capture denoising trajectories for Best-of-N inference scaling and learn from sparse binary feedback. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis. The code will be released.

While generative artificial intelligence has advanced significantly across text, image, audio, and video domains, 3D generation remains comparatively underdeveloped due to fundamental challenges such as data scarcity, algorithmic limitations, and ecosystem fragmentation. To this end, we present Step1X-3D, an open framework addressing these challenges through: (1) a rigorous data curation pipeline processing >5M assets to create a 2M high-quality dataset with standardized geometric and textural properties; (2) a two-stage 3D-native architecture combining a hybrid VAE-DiT geometry generator with an diffusion-based texture synthesis module; and (3) the full open-source release of models, training code, and adaptation modules. For geometry generation, the hybrid VAE-DiT component produces TSDF representations by employing perceiver-based latent encoding with sharp edge sampling for detail preservation. The diffusion-based texture synthesis module then ensures cross-view consistency through geometric conditioning and latent-space synchronization. Benchmark results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance that exceeds existing open-source methods, while also achieving competitive quality with proprietary solutions. Notably, the framework uniquely bridges the 2D and 3D generation paradigms by supporting direct transfer of 2D control techniques~(e.g., LoRA) to 3D synthesis. By simultaneously advancing data quality, algorithmic fidelity, and reproducibility, Step1X-3D aims to establish new standards for open research in controllable 3D asset generation.
