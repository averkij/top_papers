Raju rajuprashant@gmail.comit focuses on similarity, Analysis of learned representations has blind spot: measuring how closely embeddings align with external references, but similarity reveals only what is represented, not whether that structure is robust. We introduce geometric stability, distinct dimension that quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation, and present Shesha, framework for measuring it. Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated (ρ 0.01) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2 more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability (ρ = 0.89-0.96); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling. By quantifying how reliably systems maintain structure, geometric stability provides necessary complement to similarity for auditing representations across biological and computational systems.Neural representation analysis has long focused on similarity: measuring how closely the internal representations of different models are aligned (Kornblith et al., 2019a; Raghu et al., 2017; Morcos et al., 2018; Kriegeskorte et al., 2008). Standard tools like Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008) and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) (Kornblith et al., 2019a) have become the default for comparing representations between architectures, training runs, and domains. Yet, similarity answers only half of the question. Two models may align perfectly and still diverge under intervention. Two representations may match on content, yet differ entirely in robustness. What similarity misses is geometric stability: how consistently models representational structure holds under perturbation, resampling, or context shift. Similarity is not stability. Consider vast library. Its utility depends not merely on its inventory of books, but on the preservation of its indexing system. If every book were randomly reshuffled, the collection would remain identical, and any content-based audit would confirm that nothing is missing. Yet, the library would become functionally useless: the spatial relationships that enable retrieval have been destroyed. For foundation models, geometric stability plays the role of this index. Standard similarity metrics confirm that features are present, but fail to detect when the fine-grained relationships between them have fractured. This dissociation is not hypothetical. Two models may appear identical under CKA. The first maintains rigid geometric structure when evaluated on bootstrapped data or paraphrased inputs. The Preprint. Under review. second shows highly fluctuating geometry under the same conditions: its structure is brittle (Ilyas et al., 2019) despite perfect alignment with the first. We show that these dimensions are empirically distinct. Across 2,463 encoder configurations in 7 domains, stability and similarity show near-zero correlation (ρ 0.01), encompassing all four quadrants of the stability-similarity space (Figure 6). Spectral deletion experiments offer an explanation. Standard similarity metrics collapse to noise after removing just the top principal components, whereas geometric stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure distributed across the spectral tail. Why stability matters. Geometric stability predicts what similarity cannot. In steering experiments, supervised stability strongly predicts intervention success (ρ = 0.89-0.96, < 1018): models with task-aligned geometry accept linear steering vectors, while unstable models fracture under the same perturbations (Section 3.1). In vision, stability and transferability dissociate entirely: state-of-the-art models like DINOv2 rank last in stability despite showing the top performance for transfer (Section 3.2). In instruction tuning, geometric stability detects structural drift nearly 2 more sensitively than CKA on average (up to 5.23 in Llama), providing earlier warning of functional degradation in 73% of models while avoiding false alarms of rigid distance metrics such as Procrustes (ρ 0.93; Section 3.3). These patterns extend beyond machine learning: in CRISPR screens, stability tracks the coherence of regulatory perturbations (Section 3.4); in brain recordings, it reveals region-specific dynamics invisible to similarity (Section 3.5). The common thread is that stability captures the usability of geometric structure, not its presence. Our approach: Shesha. We introduce Shesha, named for the Hindu deity representing the invariant remainder of the cosmos (Vogel, 1995; Daniélou, 1964; Dimmitt and van Buitenen, 1978), framework for measuring geometric stability through self-consistency. Unlike similarity metrics that compare external representations between models, Shesha quantifies internal within-model reliability, providing an independent axis for diagnosing fine-tuning dynamics, safety audits, and high-dimensional interpretation. Shesha operates on Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs) from RSA (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008), assessing the consistency of RDMs derived from perturbed or resampled views of the same representation rather than comparing across systems (Appendix 6.1). Our split-half approach adapts the statistical technique of noise ceiling estimation (Nili et al., 2014), but generalizes it for an alternate purpose: rather than bounding explainable variance to normalize cross-system comparisons, we treat internal consistency itself as the subject of interest. This reframing enables applications ranging from foundation model embeddings to CRISPR perturbation screens. We employ two complementary variants (Appendix 6.1.1): (1) Feature-Split Shesha (SheshaFS) measures internal geometric consistency by correlating RDMs from disjo"

[ 1 6 3 5 9 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r 2026-1-14 Omni-R1: Towards the Unified Generative Paradigm for Multimodal Reasoning Dongjie Cheng1 Yupeng Hu3 Wenjie Wang4 Yongqi Li1 Zhixin Ma2 Hongru Cai1 Liqiang Nie5 Wenjie Li1 1 The Hong Kong Polytechnic University 2 Singapore Management University 3 Shandong University 4 University of Science and Technology of China 5 Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen) dong-jie.cheng@connect.polyu.hk, liyongqi0@gmail.com Abstract Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are making significant progress in multimodal reasoning. Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.

Geometric stability measures representational robustness under perturbation, offering complementary insights to similarity metrics in analyzing learned representations across diverse domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 Analysis of learned representations has a blind spot: it focuses on similarity, measuring how closely embeddings align with external references, but similarity reveals only what is represented, not whether that structure is robust. We introduce geometric stability, a distinct dimension that quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation, and present Shesha, a framework for measuring it. Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated (ρapprox 0.01) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2times more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability (ρ= 0.89-0.96); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling. By quantifying how reliably systems maintain structure, geometric stability provides a necessary complement to similarity for auditing representations across biological and computational systems.

Unified generative multimodal reasoning approach enables diverse reasoning skills through intermediate image generation, with a two-stage SFT+RL framework and a text-only bootstrapping variant.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are making significant progress in multimodal reasoning. Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.
