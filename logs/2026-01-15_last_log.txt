Text:"Cluster Workload Allocation: Semantic Soft Affinity Using Natural Language Processing Leszek Sliwko1, Jolanta Mizeria-Pietraszko2 1Standard Chartered Bank, EC2V 5DD London, U.K. 2Department of Computer Science, Opole University of Technology, Opole, Poland Corresponding author: Leszek Sliwko (e-mail: lsliwko@gmail.com). This work was supported in part by the Research AI & Experiment department, Standard Chartered Bank. ABSTRACT Cluster workload allocation often requires complex configurations, creating usability gap. This paper introduces semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. prototype featuring cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration. INDEX TERMS Artificial Intelligence, Kubernetes, Load Balancing, Semantic Parsing, Soft-Affinity, Task Assignment I. INTRODUCTION In any large-scale computing environment, from cloud data center to supercomputing cluster, the scheduler is one of the most critical components. Its fundamental purpose i"

A semantic, intent-driven scheduling approach uses large language models to interpret natural language hints for workload allocation in cluster systems, achieving high accuracy and improved placement compared to traditional methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Cluster workload allocation often requires complex configurations, creating a usability gap. This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration.
