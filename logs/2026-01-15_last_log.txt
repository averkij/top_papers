To enhance the inherent multilingual capabilities of Gemma 3 for the translation task, we employ two-stage fine-tuning process. First, supervised fine-tuning is performed using rich mixture of high-quality large-scale synthetic parallel data generated via state-of-the-art models and human-translated parallel data. This is followed by reinforcement learning phase, where we optimize translation quality using an ensemble of reward models, including MetricX-QE and AutoMQM, targeting translation quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TranslateGemma with human evaluation on the WMT25 test set across 10 language pairs and with automatic evaluation on the WMT24++ benchmark across 55 language pairs. Automatic metrics show consistent and substantial gains over the baseline Gemma 3 models across all sizes. Notably, smaller TranslateGemma models often achieve performance comparable to larger baseline models, offering improved efficiency. We also show that TranslateGemma models retain strong multimodal capabilities, with enhanced performance on the Vistra image translation benchmark. The release of the open TranslateGemma models aims to provide the research community with powerful and adaptable tools for machine translation. 1. Introduction In an increasingly interconnected world, machine translation (MT) plays pivotal role in bridging language barriers, facilitating global communication, and democratizing access to information. The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the state-ofthe-art in MT. However, progress is greatly benefitted by the availability of strong, open models that allow for transparency, reproducibility, and community-driven innovation.

Text:"Efficient Camera-Controlled Video Generation of Static Scenes via Sparse Diffusion and 3D Rendering6 2 0 2 4 1 ] . [ 1 7 9 6 9 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r Figure 1. Teaser. Left: Overview of our approach. Given an input image and camera trajectory, SRENDER generates sparse keyframes, reconstructs the 3D scene, and renders the full video efficiently. Right: On average, our method is roughly 43 times faster than the history-guided video diffusion baseline (HG) [43] when generating 20-second 30-fps videos from the DL3DV dataset, achieving real-time performance while maintaining comparable or better video quality.Modern video generative models based on diffusion models can produce very realistic clips, but they are computationally inefficient, often requiring minutes of GPU time for just few seconds of video. This inefficiency poses critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis. 1. Introduction Generative video models have recently achieved impressive visual fidelity. State-of-the-art models such as Sora [38] and Wan [48] can synthesize photorealistic content that rivals cinematic footage. However, these successes come at cost: current advances use diffusion-based [17] or flowmatching-based [31] techniques to generate every frame and are extremely computationally expensive. Producing even short ten-second sequence can require up to tens of thousands of large neural network evaluations due to iterative denoising in diffusion models, amounting to several minutes of GPU time on high-end hardware. This inefficiency prevents real-time use and significantly limits ap1 plications in embodied AI applications, interactive content creation, and AR/VR. allocates computation where it is most needed, maintaining visual fidelity while minimizing redundant generation. While some research has attempted to make these models more efficient by designing low-dimensional latent space architectures [29, 59], or by utilizing distillation methods [57], all existing methods still rely on neural networks to generate every frame of the video. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm. Videos are inherently redundant, as many frames depict the same underlying 3D scene under gradually varying conditions such as viewpoint, motion, or lighting. Our goal is to develop video generation framework that explicitly leverages these redundancies to enable efficient video synthesis. In this work, we focus on the practically relevant setting of camera-conditioned generation of static scenes. This allows us to study the core principle of leveraging scene redundancy for efficient video synthesis, without the additional complexity of object motion or deformation. Camera-controlled video generation is an active area of research with several recent advances [19, 43, 54]. However, as previously mentioned, all these advances rely on generating every frame with neural networks. Recent work has demonstrated that incorporating 3D priors into video generation improves temporal consistency and novel-view controllability [19, 54]. However, in all cases, 3D priors have only been used as an internal representation, or for auxiliary constraints. Every frame of the final video is still produced by diffusion-like neural generative models. Thus, while incorporating 3D priors has improved quality, it has not fundamentally addressed the efficiency barrier. This paper addresses this missing piece. To this end, we present our method, SRENDER, which generates full videos by first synthesizing sparse set of keyframes with diffusion models and then generating the dense video through 3D scene reconstruction and rendering. This approach leverages the inherent 3D structure of visual scenes: high-quality reconstructions can be obtained even from sparse multi-view observations, without requiring dense video input. The camera-controlled video can be rendered very efficiently from the reconstructed 3D scene using standard physically-based rendering techniques. We build on advances in 3D reconstruction and rendering, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [23] that can render complex photo-realistic scenes at very high framerates, and follow-ups [22, 35] that can reconstruct 3DGS from multiview observations with neural networks. SRENDER also includes model that adaptively selects how many keyframes to generate for given camera trajectory. Simple trajectories with smooth motion or limited parallax can be reconstructed accurately from very few keyframes, whereas complex trajectories with large viewpoint changes require denser sampling. By predicting this keyframe budget directly from the camera path, SRENDER Across videos up to twenty seconds long, our adaptive keyframe selection model chooses between 4 and 35 keyframes, corresponding to generating at most onetenth as many frames as would be required by standard 30 fps video. Our approach achieves more than 40 speed-up on DL3DV [30] and more than 20 speed-up on RealEstate10k [12], while maintaining comparable visual quality and temporal consistency. These results demonstrate that explicit 3D reasoning and adaptive sparse generation can dramatically reduce the computational cost of video synthesis without sacrificing fidelity. 2. Related Work 2.1. Camera-controlled Video Models Video generative models have seen fast progress in recent years, driven by diffusion models [17]. Most models focus on text-to-video, or image-to-video tasks [2, 10, 13, 38, 48]. Following the s"

DeepResearchEval presents an automated framework for creating complex research tasks and evaluating them through agent-based methods that adapt to task specifics and verify facts without relying on citations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep research systems are widely used for multi-step web research, analysis, and cross-source synthesis, yet their evaluation remains challenging. Existing benchmarks often require annotation-intensive task construction, rely on static evaluation dimensions, or fail to reliably verify facts when citations are missing. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DeepResearchEval, an automated framework for deep research task construction and agentic evaluation. For task construction, we propose a persona-driven pipeline generating realistic, complex research tasks anchored in diverse user profiles, applying a two-stage filter Task Qualification and Search Necessity to retain only tasks requiring multi-source evidence integration and external retrieval. For evaluation, we propose an agentic pipeline with two components: an Adaptive Point-wise Quality Evaluation that dynamically derives task-specific evaluation dimensions, criteria, and weights conditioned on each generated task, and an Active Fact-Checking that autonomously extracts and verifies report statements via web search, even when citations are missing.

TranslateGemma enhances Gemma 3's multilingual capabilities through two-stage fine-tuning with synthetic and human-translated data, achieving superior translation quality with improved efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present TranslateGemma, a suite of open machine translation models based on the Gemma 3 foundation models. To enhance the inherent multilingual capabilities of Gemma 3 for the translation task, we employ a two-stage fine-tuning process. First, supervised fine-tuning is performed using a rich mixture of high-quality large-scale synthetic parallel data generated via state-of-the-art models and human-translated parallel data. This is followed by a reinforcement learning phase, where we optimize translation quality using an ensemble of reward models, including MetricX-QE and AutoMQM, targeting translation quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TranslateGemma with human evaluation on the WMT25 test set across 10 language pairs and with automatic evaluation on the WMT24++ benchmark across 55 language pairs. Automatic metrics show consistent and substantial gains over the baseline Gemma 3 models across all sizes. Notably, smaller TranslateGemma models often achieve performance comparable to larger baseline models, offering improved efficiency. We also show that TranslateGemma models retain strong multimodal capabilities, with enhanced performance on the Vistra image translation benchmark. The release of the open TranslateGemma models aims to provide the research community with powerful and adaptable tools for machine translation.

FocusUI is an efficient UI grounding framework that reduces computational overhead by selecting relevant visual tokens while preserving positional continuity through a novel PosPad strategy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.

"FocusUI is an efficient UI grounding framework that reduces computational overhead by selecting relevant visual tokens while preserving positional continuity through a novel PosPad strategy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention.

Diffusion-based video generation is made more efficient through keyframe-based 3D reconstruction and rendering, enabling faster synthesis with maintained visual quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Modern video generative models based on diffusion models can produce very realistic clips, but they are computationally inefficient, often requiring minutes of GPU time for just a few seconds of video. This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.

AI-generated summary 				 We propose OpenVoxel, a training-free algorithm for grouping and captioning sparse voxels for the open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding tasks. Given the sparse voxel rasterization (SVR) model obtained from multi-view images of a 3D scene, our OpenVoxel is able to produce meaningful groups that describe different objects in the scene. Also, by leveraging powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our OpenVoxel successfully build an informative scene map by captioning each group, enabling further 3D scene understanding tasks such as open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) or referring expression segmentation (RES). Unlike previous methods, our method is training-free and does not introduce embeddings from a CLIP/BERT text encoder. Instead, we directly proceed with text-to-text search using MLLMs. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to recent studies, particularly in complex referring expression segmentation (RES) tasks.

EvoFSM is a structured self-evolving framework for LLM agents that uses finite state machines to improve adaptability while maintaining control through constrained optimization and memory mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 While LLM-based agents have shown promise for deep research, most existing approaches rely on fixed workflows that struggle to adapt to real-world, open-ended queries. Recent work therefore explores self-evolution by allowing agents to rewrite their own code or prompts to improve problem-solving ability, but unconstrained optimization often triggers instability, hallucinations, and instruction drift. We propose EvoFSM, a structured self-evolving framework that achieves both adaptability and control by evolving an explicit Finite State Machine (FSM) instead of relying on free-form rewriting. EvoFSM decouples the optimization space into macroscopic Flow (state-transition logic) and microscopic Skill (state-specific behaviors), enabling targeted improvements under clear behavioral boundaries. Guided by a critic mechanism, EvoFSM refines the FSM through a small set of constrained operations, and further incorporates a self-evolving memory that distills successful trajectories as reusable priors and failure patterns as constraints for future queries. Extensive evaluations on five multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoFSM. In particular, EvoFSM reaches 58.0% accuracy on the DeepSearch benchmark. Additional results on interactive decision-making tasks further validate its generalization.

"EvoFSM is a structured self-evolving framework for LLM agents that uses finite state machines to improve adaptability while maintaining control through constrained optimization and memory mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 While LLM-based agents have shown promise for deep research, most existing approaches rely on fixed workflows that struggle to adapt to real-world, open-ended queries. Recent work therefore explores self-evolution by allowing agents to rewrite their own code or prompts to improve problem-solving ability, but unconstrained optimization often triggers instability, hallucinations, and instruction drift. We propose EvoFSM, a structured self-evolving framework that achieves both adaptability and control by evolving an explicit Finite State Machine (FSM) instead of relying on free-form rewriting. EvoFSM decouples the optimization space into macroscopic Flow (state-transition logic) and microscopic Skill (state-specific behaviors), enabling targeted improvements under clear behavioral boundaries. Guided by a critic mechanism, EvoFSM refines the FSM through a small set of constrained operations, and further incorporates a self-evolving memory that distills successful trajectories as reusable priors and failure patterns as constraints for future queries. Extensive evaluations on five multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoFSM. In particular, EvoFSM reaches 58.0% accuracy on the DeepSearch benchmark. Additional results on interactive decision-making tasks further validate its generalization."

Memory mechanisms in large language models and multi-modal language models are categorized into implicit, explicit, and agentic paradigms, supporting enhanced reasoning, adaptability, and contextual fidelity through internal parameters, external knowledge storage, and persistent agent memory structures.  					AI-generated summary 				 Memory plays a foundational role in augmenting the reasoning, adaptability, and contextual fidelity of modern Large Language Models and Multi-Modal LLMs. As these models transition from static predictors to interactive systems capable of continual learning and personalized inference, the incorporation of memory mechanisms has emerged as a central theme in their architectural and functional evolution. This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential. Key architectural advances, benchmark tasks, and open challenges are discussed, including issues related to memory capacity, alignment, factual consistency, and cross-system interoperability.
