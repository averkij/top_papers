ECHO is a reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes policy and critic through co-evolutionary loops, addressing staleness issues in critique-guided training of language model agents.  					AI-generated summary 				 Critique-guided reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training LLM agents by augmenting sparse outcome rewards with natural-language feedback. However, current methods often rely on static or offline critic models, which fail to adapt as the policy evolves. In on-policy RL, the agent's error patterns shift over time, causing stationary critics to become stale and providing feedback of diminishing utility. To address this, we introduce ECHO (Evolving Critic for Hindsight-Guided Optimization)}, a framework that jointly optimizes the policy and critic through a synchronized co-evolutionary loop. ECHO utilizes a cascaded rollout mechanism where the critic generates multiple diagnoses for an initial trajectory, followed by policy refinement to enable group-structured advantage estimation. We address the challenge of learning plateaus via a saturation-aware gain shaping objective, which rewards the critic for inducing incremental improvements in high-performing trajectories. By employing dual-track GRPO updates, ECHO ensures the critic's feedback stays synchronized with the evolving policy. Experimental results show that ECHO yields more stable training and higher long-horizon task success across open-world environments.

Авторы решают проблему устаревания критика, который в классических подходах остаётся статичным, пока политика агента эволюционирует и изменяет паттерны ошибок. Метод использует каскадный механизм генерации множественных диагнозов траекторий и насыщающую функцию формирования награды для преодоления плато обучения. Экспериментальные результаты показывают, что ECHO обеспечивает более стабильное обучение и выше успешность решения долгосрочных задач в открытых окружениях.",
