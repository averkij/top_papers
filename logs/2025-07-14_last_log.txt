Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, RoPE scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to token dependency strategy that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality. Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal tube masking during training with compatible inference-time masking policy to avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on GenEval, COSMOSVideo2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.

Given an image describing dog surfing on the sea, the user may ask the question What color is the ball?. The model may hallucinate response The ball in the image is green, while there is no ball in the image. We expect the model to recognize the conflict between the visual input and the textual input and give response like The image does not contain ball. 1. Introduction The recent success of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has advanced the development of artificial intelligence in vision-language tasks (Dai et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; 2024b; Bai et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024). These models enable the joint reasoning over visual and textual inputs, and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various vision-language tasks that require multimodal reasoning (Fu et al., 2024; Yue et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024c; Lu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025). The powerful capabilities of these MLLMs are typically achieved by pretraining separate language and vision models on large-scale datasets, and then Robust Multimodal Large Language Models Against Modality Conflict aligning their features to enable multimodal reasoning (Liu et al., 2023; 2024b). Despite the impressive performance of MLLMs, they are prone to hallucinations in real-world scenarios (Huang et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024b). Hallucinations refer to the phenomenon where MLLMs generate incorrect or misleading information not supported by the input data (Ji et al., 2023). Existing works have proposed various methods to alleviate hallucinations in MLLMs, such as improving the quality of training data (Liu et al., 2024a; Yu et al., 2024a), adjusting the decoding strategies (Leng et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024), and align the model with human preference (Zhao et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024b). These methods mainly target more precise alignment between the features of different modalities to reduce hallucinations. However, existing works on alleviating hallucinations in MLLMs mainly focus on the conflicts between the model responses and the inputs, neglecting possible source of hallucinations: the conflicts between the inputs from different modalities, which we call modality conflict. For instance, as shown in Figure 1, given an image describing dog surfing on the sea, the user may ask the question What color is the ball?. In this case, the question supposes ball exists in the image, and the model may hallucinate response The ball in the image is green, while there is no ball in the image. We expect the model to recognize the conflict between the visual input and the textual input and give response like The image does not contain ball. Even with the capability of perfectly aligning features of different modalities, MLLMs may still fall into dilemma when facing such intrinsically conflicted information between inputs. To this end, we aim to investigate such hallucination phenomenon in MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. In this paper, we first give formal definition of modality conflict in vision-language tasks in terms of objects, attributes, and relationships in the visual and textual inputs. Based on the definition, we construct dataset named MultiModal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate the modality conflict in vision-language tasks. We evaluate various prevalent MLLMs (Dai et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b; Bai et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024) on the MMMC dataset and find that most of them lack the ability to recognize the modality conflict and are prone to hallucinations. To alleviate the hallucination caused by the modality conflict and work towards more robust MLLMs, we investigate the effectiveness of three methods: prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. We conduct extensive experiments on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that causes hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs. To summarize, the contributions of this paper are as follows: This paper reveals an unnoticed source of hallucinations in MLLMs: modality conflict. The formal definition of modality conflict is presented in the level of objects, attributes, and relationships. We construct dataset called Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate t"

A neural rendering method uses compressed light-field tokens to efficiently represent scenes and render novel views with varying compute budgets.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as "compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely, given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time, given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach, achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size, rendering quality, and rendering speed.

MetaStone-S1, a reflective generative model using a self-supervised process reward model, achieves efficient reasoning and scalable performance with fewer parameters compared to existing models.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce our first reflective generative model MetaStone-S1, which obtains OpenAI o3's performance via the self-supervised process reward model (SPRM). Through sharing the backbone network and using task-specific heads for next token prediction and process scoring respectively, SPRM successfully integrates the policy model and process reward model(PRM) into a unified interface without extra process annotation, reducing over 99% PRM parameters for efficient reasoning. Equipped with SPRM, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable for test time scaling (TTS), and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low, medium, and high), based on the controllable thinking length. Moreover, we empirically establish a scaling law that reveals the relationship between total thinking computation and TTS performance. Experiments demonstrate that our MetaStone-S1 achieves comparable performance to OpenAI-o3-mini's series with only 32B parameter size. To support the research community, we have open-sourced MetaStone-S1 at https://github.com/MetaStone-AI/MetaStone-S1.

NeuralOS uses a combination of RNNs and diffusion-based rendering to simulate OS GUIs by predicting screen frames from user inputs, demonstrating realistic GUI rendering and state transitions.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events. NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for future human-computer interaction systems.

Lumos-1 is an autoregressive video generator that uses a modified LLM architecture with MM-RoPE and AR-DF to address spatiotemporal correlation and frame-wise loss imbalance, achieving competitive performance with fewer resources.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality. Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.

In this paper, we introduce Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality. Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code and models are available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/Lumos."

A part-aware diffusion framework, CoPart, enhances 3D generation by decomposing objects into contextual parts, improving complexity handling, relationship modeling, and part-level conditioning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3) Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene composition with unprecedented controllability.

Investigation of modality conflict in multimodal large language models reveals its role in causing hallucinations, with reinforcement learning emerging as the most effective mitigation strategy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.
