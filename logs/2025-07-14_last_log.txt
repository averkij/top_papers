Text:"What Has Foundation Model Found? Using Inductive Bias to Probe for World Models Keyon Vafa 1 Peter G. Chang 2 Ashesh Rambachan 2 Sendhil Mullainathan 2 5 2 0 2 0 1 ] . [ 2 2 5 9 6 0 . 7 0 5 2 : r aFoundation models are premised on the idea that sequence prediction can uncover deeper domain understanding, much like how Keplers predictions of planetary motion later led to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics. However, evaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains challenge. We develop technique for evaluating foundation models that examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation models inductive bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail to generalize. 1. Introduction The promise of foundation models relies on central presumption: that learning to predict sequences can uncover deeper truths, or optimistically, even world model. While this idea is new in one sense, it is old in another. Hundreds of years ago, astronomers like Kepler discovered geometric patterns that could pinpoint the future locations of planets in the night sky. Newton would later expand on this progress to develop Newtonian mechanics, fundamental laws that could not only predict the movement of planets but also explain physical properties across the universe (Koestler, 1959; Gin1Harvard University 2MIT. Correspondence to: Keyon Vafa <kvafa@g.harvard.edu>. Proceedings of the 42 nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada. PMLR 267, 2025. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 gerich, 2004). This path from predicting sequences to understanding the deeper mechanisms that underlie them is not unique to physics. In biology, animal breeders noticed patterns in the traits of offspring long before their predictive insights inspired Mendel to develop theory of genetics. How would we know if foundation models have also made the leap from making accurate predictions to developing reliable world models? This paper develops framework for answering this question. Specifically, we create procedure that, when given foundation model and world model, tests whether the foundation model has learned that world model. We call this technique an inductive bias probe, and it is built on simple insight: the implicit world model of foundation model is revealed by how it extrapolates from small amount of information. This is inspired by how scientists use world models to make inferences from small amounts of data. Similarly, the inductive bias of foundation model reveals its world model. We first demonstrate this procedure using an example from physics. Specifically, we aim to replicate Keplers and Newtons experiments, albeit replacing the physicist with foundation model of orbital mechanics. Much like Kepler, the model is able to predict orbital trajectories, even for solar systems it has not seen. What would it mean for this foundation models inductive bias to be toward Newtonian mechanics? We demonstrate one tangible way to test this: we fine-tune the foundation model on small dataset where the output is exactly the force vector (a cornerstone of Newtonian mechanics) at each point in the trajectory. If the foundation models world model is toward Newtonian mechanics, it should have an inductive bias towards these force vectors. In contrast, Figure 1 shows that the model produces poor force vectors. More extremely, when we perform this exercise at larger scale across many solar systems, the laws of gravity it uses to generalize bear no resemblance to Newtons law  (Table 1)  . We further apply inductive bias probes in other domains with known world model: lattice problems and Othello games (Liu et al., 2022; Hazineh et al., 2023; Nanda et al., 2023b; Vafa et al., 2024). Across these domains, we find that neural sequence models have weak inductive biases What Has Foundation Model Found? Using Inductive Bias to Probe for World Models Figure 1: Each pair of panels illustrates the trajectory of planet in the solar system and its gravitational force vectors, comparing the true Newtonian forces (left) to the predicted forces (right) from transformer foundation model pretrained on orbital sequences and fine-tuned to predict forces. While the model excels at generating accurate predictions of planetary trajectories, it does not have an inductive bias toward true Newtonian mechanics; moreover, its force predictions recover nonsensical force law, as revealed by symbolic regression. toward the given world models. We also highlight practical implication: models that perform better on inductive bias probes have better performance when theyre fine-tuned to perform new tasks that rely on the underlying world model. Data and tasks. Let denote an input and denote some output. dataset = {(x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn)} is collection of input-output pairs. task : is mapping between inputs and outputs. Taken together, our results provide direction for understanding the deficiencies of foundation models: if models inductive bias isnt toward known model of reality, what is it toward? We explore this question by examining whether these foundation models have alternative inductive biases. Our analysis reveals that these models instead behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail to generalize. For physics, rather than learning one universal physical law, the foundation model applies different, seemingly nonsensical laws depending on the task its being applied to. In lattice and Othello, models have an inductive bias toward the set of legal next-tokens (e.g. boards legal next moves) rather than the world model itself. 2. Framework In this section, we lay out our framework for evaluating whether foundation model has learned postulated world model. We develop an inductive bias probe, which is procedure that evaluates the foundation models behavior as it adapts to new tasks. Foundation models: foundation model is learning algorithm which, whe"
