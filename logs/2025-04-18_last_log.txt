Introduction Pre-training datasets for large language models (LLMs) have scaled to trillions of tokens, typically combining large-scale web crawls with smaller, highquality domain-specific datasets. These corpora enable the development of generalist models capable of addressing diverse tasks. However, their vast scale and heterogeneity pose challenges in balancing general knowledge with domain expertise, often leading to inefficient utilization of high-value data for specialized capabilities. Recent studies emphasize the importance of the final stage of pertaining, commonly referred to as mid-training, where models are refined on targeted, high-quality data to enhance specific capabilities. For example, [1] demonstrated that emphasizing domain-specific datasets during the final pre-training phase significantly improves performance on benchmarks such as GSM8K [2] (math), MMLU [3] (reasoning), and HumanEval [4] (coding). Similarly, OLMo 2 [5] mixes high-quality web data with curated STEM references, synthetic math datasets, and encyclopedic content for mid-training, achieving notable gains in math reasoning tasks. These findings highlight the potential of carefully curated data mixtures in mid-training for improving domain performance. Despite the success of pre-training, optimizing data mixtures for both general and domain-specific tasks remains challenge: (1) Large-scale datasets such as Figure 1 Pre-training 1B model on ClimbMix shows better scaling effects than training on other datasets. We measure the average performance on 12 downstream benchmarks. Common Crawl 1 offer unmatched diversity and scale but lack explicit domain labels, making it difficult to extract domain-relevant content. Filtering data often relies on general-purpose heuristics like perplexity or educational value [6], which do not necessarily capture the most informative or high-quality content for specific domains. (2) Even with curated datasets like The Pile [7] with domain annotations, selecting an optimal data mixture is non-trivial due to the complex, 1https://commoncrawl.org/ Work done while Yu Yang was at NVIDIA; now at OpenAI. 2 with Georgia Institute of Technology, USA; 2025 NVIDIA.

CLIMB: CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping for Language Model Pre-training Figure 2 Given large-scale pre-training data consisting of web-scale and curated sources, CLIMB identifies the optimal mixture of different topics (A, B, C) to improve performance in target task (e.g., general reasoning). We compare the performance of state-of-the-art language models across different parameter scales on general reasoning benchmarks. CLIMB achieves better tradeoff between model size and performance, demonstrating more efficient scaling trend compared to prior models. nonlinear relationship between dataset composition and model performance. For instance, optimizing model for coding tasks requires not just programmingrelated content but also complementary knowledge from mathematics, reasoning, and security. To these address Iterative (CLIMB)a novel challenges, we propose Data Mixture CLustering-based Bootstrapping framework for automating the search for optimal data mixtures during pre-training. CLIMB consists of three key steps: (1) embedding and clustering large-scale datasets, (2) constructing mixture-performance pairs by sampling and pruning data mixtures and training proxy models, and (3) fitting predictor. By treating the data mixture as input features and performance metrics as target labels, we train regression model as predictor. This approach enables efficient, iterative refinement of data mixtures without relying solely on predefined domain labels. We frame data mixture construction as search problem and solve it using bootstrapping strategy. At each iteration, candidate mixtures are proposed, pruned, and refined to optimize diversity and domain relevance. Unlike static mixing strategies, our method dynamically adjusts data mixtures throughout training using weak predictor approach, integrating multiple predictors iteratively to discover effective configurations for domain adaptation. CLIMB actively Figure 3 Visualization of CLIMBs iterative search process using t-SNE. Each point represents data mixture config in the search space, with different iterations (CLIMB-Iter1, CLIMB-Iter2, CLIMB-Iter3) illustrating how the search space is refined over iterations. Initially, the search explores broad set of configurations (Iter 1), progressively narrowing in subsequent iterations (Iter 2 and Iter 3) as CLIMB selects more optimal mixtures. learns to refine and optimize data mixtures based on real-world feedba"

Compared with general video captioning, AD demands plot-relevant narration with explicit character name references, posing unique challenges in movie understanding.To identify active main characters and focus on storyline-relevant regions, we propose FocusedAD, novel framework that delivers character-centric movie audio descriptions. It includes: (i) Character Perception Module(CPM) for tracking character regions and linking them to names; (ii) Dynamic Prior Module(DPM) that injects contextual cues from prior ADs and subtitles via learnable soft prompts; and (iii) Focused Caption Module(FCM) that generates narrations enriched with plot-relevant details and named characters. To overcome limitations in character identification, we also introduce an automated pipeline for building character query banks. FocusedAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including strong zero-shot results on MAD-evalNamed and our newly proposed Cinepile-AD dataset.

Pre-training datasets are typically collected from web content and lack inherent domain divisions. For instance, widely used datasets like Common Crawl do not include explicit domain labels, while manually curating labeled datasets such as The Pile is labor-intensive. Consequently, identifying an optimal pre-training data mixture remains a challenging problem, despite its significant benefits for pre-training performance. To address these challenges, we propose CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping (CLIMB), an automated framework that discovers, evaluates, and refines data mixtures in a pre-training setting. Specifically, CLIMB embeds and clusters large-scale datasets in a semantic space and then iteratively searches for optimal mixtures using a smaller proxy model and a predictor. When continuously trained on 400B tokens with this mixture, our 1B model exceeds the state-of-the-art Llama-3.2-1B by 2.0%. Moreover, we observe that optimizing for a specific domain (e.g., Social Sciences) yields a 5% improvement over random sampling. Finally, we introduce ClimbLab, a filtered 1.2-trillion-token corpus with 20 clusters as a research playground, and ClimbMix, a compact yet powerful 400-billion-token dataset designed for efficient pre-training that delivers superior performance under an equal token budget. We analyze the final data mixture, elucidating the characteristics of an optimal data mixture. Our data is available at: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/climb/

"Pre-training datasets are typically collected from web content and lack inherent domain divisions. For instance, widely used datasets like Common Crawl do not include explicit domain labels, while manually curating labeled datasets such as The Pile is labor-intensive. Consequently, identifying an optimal pre-training data mixture remains a challenging problem, despite its significant benefits for pre-training performance. To address these challenges, we propose CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping (CLIMB), an automated framework that discovers, evaluates, and refines data mixtures in a pre-training setting. Specifically, CLIMB embeds and clusters large-scale datasets in a semantic space and then iteratively searches for optimal mixtures using a smaller proxy model and a predictor. When continuously trained on 400B tokens with this mixture, our 1B model exceeds the state-of-the-art Llama-3.2-1B by 2.0%. Moreover, we observe that optimizing for a specific domain (e.g., Social Sciences) yields a 5% improvement over random sampling. Finally, we introduce ClimbLab, a filtered 1.2-trillion-token corpus with 20 clusters as a research playground, and ClimbMix, a compact yet powerful 400-billion-token dataset designed for efficient pre-training that delivers superior performance under an equal token budget. We analyze the final data mixture, elucidating the characteristics of an optimal data mixture. Our data is available at: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/climb/"

Movie Audio Description (AD) aims to narrate visual content during dialogue-free segments, particularly benefiting blind and visually impaired (BVI) audiences. Compared with general video captioning, AD demands plot-relevant narration with explicit character name references, posing unique challenges in movie understanding.To identify active main characters and focus on storyline-relevant regions, we propose FocusedAD, a novel framework that delivers character-centric movie audio descriptions. It includes: (i) a Character Perception Module(CPM) for tracking character regions and linking them to names; (ii) a Dynamic Prior Module(DPM) that injects contextual cues from prior ADs and subtitles via learnable soft prompts; and (iii) a Focused Caption Module(FCM) that generates narrations enriched with plot-relevant details and named characters. To overcome limitations in character identification, we also introduce an automated pipeline for building character query banks. FocusedAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including strong zero-shot results on MAD-eval-Named and our newly proposed Cinepile-AD dataset. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Thorin215/FocusedAD .

The success of text-to-image (T2I) generation models has spurred a proliferation of numerous model checkpoints fine-tuned from the same base model on various specialized datasets. This overwhelming specialized model production introduces new challenges for high parameter redundancy and huge storage cost, thereby necessitating the development of effective methods to consolidate and unify the capabilities of diverse powerful models into a single one. A common practice in model merging adopts static linear interpolation in the parameter space to achieve the goal of style mixing. However, it neglects the features of T2I generation task that numerous distinct models cover sundry styles which may lead to incompatibility and confusion in the merged model. To address this issue, we introduce a style-promptable image generation pipeline which can accurately generate arbitrary-style images under the control of style vectors. Based on this design, we propose the score distillation based model merging paradigm (DMM), compressing multiple models into a single versatile T2I model. Moreover, we rethink and reformulate the model merging task in the context of T2I generation, by presenting new merging goals and evaluation protocols. Our experiments demonstrate that DMM can compactly reorganize the knowledge from multiple teacher models and achieve controllable arbitrary-style generation.

Unlike traditional methods that use static linear interpolation, DMM incorporates style vectors to enable accurate generation of images in various styles while avoiding incompatibility issues.
