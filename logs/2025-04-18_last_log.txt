Text:"5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 6 2 6 2 1 . 4 0 5 2 : r Packing Input Frame Context in Next-Frame Prediction Models for Video Generation Lvmin Zhang and Maneesh Agrawala Stanford University We present neural network structure, FramePack, to train next-frame (or nextframe-section) prediction models for video generation. The FramePack compresses input frames to make the transformer context length fixed number regardless of the video length. As result, we are able to process large number of frames using video diffusion with computation bottleneck similar to image diffusion. This also makes the training video batch sizes significantly higher (batch sizes become comparable to image diffusion training). We also propose an anti-drifting sampling method that generates frames in inverted temporal order with early-established endpoints to avoid exposure bias (error accumulation over iterations). Finally, we show that existing video diffusion models can be finetuned with FramePack, and their visual quality may be improved because the next-frame prediction supports more balanced diffusion schedulers with less extreme flow shift timesteps. Forgetting and drifting are the two most critical problems in next-frame (or next-frame-section) prediction models for video generation. Herein, "forgetting" refers to the fading of memory as the model struggles to remember earlier content and maintain consistent temporal dependencies, whereas "drifting" refers to the iterative degradation of visual quality due to error accumulation over time (also called exposure bias). fundamental dilemma emerges when attempting to simultaneously address both forgetting and drifting: any method that mitigates forgetting by enhancing memory may also make error accumulation/propagation faster, thereby exacerbating drifting; any method that reduces drifting by interrupting error propagation and weakening the temporal dependencies (e.g., masking or re-noising the history) may also worsen the forgetting.

[ 1 2 2 1 3 1 . 4 0 5 2 : r aLarge Video Models (LVMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in video understanding but often suffer from misalignment with human intuition and video hallucination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce VistaDPO, novel framework for Video Hierarchical SpatialTemporal Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, dataset of 7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination. The code and data are available at VistaDPO Repository. 1. Introduction Achieving human-like reasoning capabilities for videos is critical research topic in the field of AI. In recent years, Large Video Models (LVMs) (Li et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a; Lin et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024d; Wu et al., 2024a; Cheng et al., 2024b; Fei et al., 2024b; Jin et al., 2024; Qian et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025) have garnered significant research attention. Built upon Large Language Models *Equal contribution 1The University of Hong Kong 2The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 3National University of Singapore 4University of Texas at Dallas 5Nanyang Correspondence to: Hao Fei Technological University. <haofei37@nus.edu.sg>. Figure 1. (a) Traditional textual DPO overlooks multimodal information, limiting video-language tasks. (b) Existing multimodal DPO methods rely on coarse alignment, missing rich temporal and perceptual details. (c&d) VistaDPO overcomes these limitations with hierarchical spatiotemporal preference optimization framework, enabling fine-grained video-language alignment and precise reasoning over video dynamics. Here, yw is the preferred response over yl, and vw the visual input more likely to produce it than vl. (LLMs) (Touvron et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024), LVMs leverage the powerful intelligence of LLMs in language, achieving unprecedented understanding of video content. However, increasing studies reveal that LVMs encounter critical issues, such as video understanding that deviates from human intuition (Zhou et al., 2024a; Fei et al., 2024a; Cheng et al., 2024a; Hu et al., 2024) or the phenomenon of video hallucination (Wang et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024), where the model outputs content that does not align with the input, e.g., user instructions, video content. The root of these issues lies in the inherent nature of current LVM architectures (Yan et al., 2021; Cheng et al., 2024b; Lin et al., 2023), where most LVMs integrate video encoder (e.g., ViT) into textoriented LLMs through connector to achieve video signal 1 Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Preference Optimization interpretation. Since backbone LLMs undergo extensive pre-training on large-scale language data while video encoders lack peer capability, this gap leads LLMs to produce overly confident outputs based on biased or even incorrect perceptions of video content from the encoder. While the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with video-language pairs (Wang et al., 2024; Leng et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024) can partially improve the alignment between the two modalities in LVMs, fundamentally addressing the issue requires reliance on extremely large-scale data. Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2024) has been proposed as promising alternative to SFT. It trains LLMs to prefer responses chosen by evaluators over rejected ones when presented with user query. By identifying which response better aligns with human preferences rather than requiring precise target outputs, DPO significantly alleviates dependence on annotated data while enhancing alignment with human values and effectively addressing hallucination issues. Some follow-up studies (Xie et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024f; Zhou et al., 2024b; Fu et al., 2025b) have extended DPO from textual to multimodal LLMs, facilitating cross-modal alignment and improving the generalization capabilities of the models. Most recently, Hound-DPO (Zhang et al., 2024b) pioneers video DPO, demonstrating that tailored rewards through DPO can significantly enhance the performance of LVMs. Unfortunately, we find that this work straightforwardly applies the DPO strategy designed for image-text LLMs to video-language preference alignment (as shown in Figure 1), which introduces two critical limitations. First, Zhang et al. (2024b) fails to adequately consider the temporal characteristics of videos. Unlike static images, videos always require both spatial semantic understanding and dynamic temporal reasoning (Fei et al., 2024c), necessitating comprehensive modeling of the spatial-temporal attributes of videos. Second, their work focuses solely on coarse-grained alignment between video and language (response text) at the instance level, which may lead to suboptimal preference alignment (Zeng et al., 2024; Gunjal et al., 2024). We emphasize that achieving proper alignment between two modalities requires fine-grained preference alignment. Intuitively, dynamic videos correspond to paired text at multiple hierarchical levels. To address these challenges, we propose novel framework, Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Direct Preference Optimization (namely VistaDPO), aiming to strengthen LVMs. VistaDPO improves text-video preference alignment across hierarchical granularities. Specifically, we design three levels of alignment (as shown in Figure 1): Instance Level: Matching the overall video content with the most appropriate response for semantic alignment. Temporal Level: Aligning v"

Charts are ubiquitous, as people often use them to analyze data, answer questions, and discover critical insights. However, performing complex analytical tasks with charts requires significant perceptual and cognitive effort. Chart Question Answering (CQA) systems automate this process by enabling models to interpret and reason with visual representations of data. However, existing benchmarks like ChartQA lack real-world diversity and have recently shown performance saturation with modern large vision-language models (LVLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce ChartQAPro, a new benchmark that includes 1,341 charts from 157 diverse sources, spanning various chart types, including infographics and dashboards, and featuring 1,948 questions in various types, such as multiple-choice, conversational, hypothetical, and unanswerable questions, to better reflect real-world challenges.

Large Video Models (LVMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in video understanding but often suffer from misalignment with human intuition and video hallucination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of 7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination. The code and data are available at https://github.com/HaroldChen19/VistaDPO.

World simulation has gained increasing popularity due to its ability to model virtual environments and predict the consequences of actions. However, the limited temporal context window often leads to failures in maintaining long-term consistency, particularly in preserving 3D spatial consistency. In this work, we present WorldMem, a framework that enhances scene generation with a memory bank consisting of memory units that store memory frames and states (e.g., poses and timestamps). By employing a memory attention mechanism that effectively extracts relevant information from these memory frames based on their states, our method is capable of accurately reconstructing previously observed scenes, even under significant viewpoint or temporal gaps. Furthermore, by incorporating timestamps into the states, our framework not only models a static world but also captures its dynamic evolution over time, enabling both perception and interaction within the simulated world. Extensive experiments in both virtual and real scenarios validate the effectiveness of our approach.
