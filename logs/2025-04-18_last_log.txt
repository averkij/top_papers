Yunxiang Zhang 1 Muhammad Khalifa 1 Shitanshu Bhushan 1 Grant Murphy 1 Lajanugen Logeswaran 2 Jaekyeom Kim 2 Moontae Lee 2 3 Honglak Lee 1 2 Lu Wang1. Introduction Existing evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents on scientific discovery lacks objective baselines and metrics to assess the viability of their proposed methods. To address this issue, we introduce MLRC-BENCH, benchmark designed to quantify how effectively language agents can tackle challenging Machine Learning (ML) Research Competitions. Our benchmark highlights open research problems that demand novel methodologies, in contrast to recent benchmarks such as OpenAIs MLE-Bench (Chan et al., 2024) and METRs RE-Bench (Wijk et al., 2024), which focus on well-established research tasks that are largely solvable through sufficient engineering effort. Unlike prior work, e.g., AI Scientist (Lu et al., 2024b), which evaluates the endto-end agentic pipeline by using LLM-as-a-judge, MLRC-BENCH measures the key steps of proposing and implementing novel research methods and evaluates them with newly proposed rigorous protocol and objective metrics. Our curated suite of 7 competition tasks reveals significant challenges for LLM agents. Even the best-performing tested agent (gemini-exp-1206 under MLAB (Huang et al., 2024a)) closes only 9.3% of the gap between baseline and top human participant scores. Furthermore, our analysis reveals misalignment between the LLM-judged innovation and their actual performance on cutting-edge ML research problems. MLRC-BENCH is dynamic benchmark, which is designed to continually grow with new ML competitions to encourage rigorous and objective evaluations of AIs research capabilities. 1University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 2LG AI Research 3University of Illinois, Chicago. Correspondence to: Yunxiang Zhang <yunxiang@umich.edu>. 1 Evaluating large language model (LLM) research agents (Baek et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024b; Lu et al., 2024b) has so far been restricted to one of two directions. The first direction involves tasking the agent with end-to-end scientific discoveryproposing research idea, writing implementation code, running experiments, and eventually producing full paper as done by AI Scientist (Lu et al., 2024b). One issue with such evaluation is the lack of reliable baseline method that enables objective evaluation of the proposed approach. The second direction, on the other hand, evaluates the agents ability to produce code that solves Kaggle-style machine learning (ML) engineering competition, skipping idea proposal and paper writing altogether (Huang et al., 2024a; Chan et al., 2024). While evaluation in this case is straightforward, this setup rarely demands genuine research novelty beyond existing methods. Consequently, neither of these setups paints full picture of whether LLM research agents are able to come up with research ideas that are both novel and effective, which we aim to address here. Competitions at ML conferences and workshops provide valuable testbed for evaluating research agents by assessing both novelty and effectiveness against established baselines. Unlike Kaggle-style contests, these challenges address unresolved and important problems recognized by the ML community. In addition, public leaderboards facilitate objective comparisons to human experts. If an algorithm truly outperforms known baselines, improvements in benchmark scores provide reliable signal as to the effectiveness of the proposed method. Therefore, this paper introduces MLRC-BENCH as benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLM-based research agents to propose and implement novel methods. Drawing on tasks from recent ML conference competitions, MLRCBENCH enables the evaluation of both novelty and effectiveness of research agents ideas compared to reliable baseline method and the top human solution. In particular, it emphasizes objective metrics on tasks such as LLM merging (Tam et al., 2024) and machine unlearning (Triantafillou et al., 2024), closely mirroring ongoing research challenges. MLRC-BENCH: Can Language Agents Solve Machine Learning Research Challenges? Table 1. Comparison between MLRC-BENCH and existing work on automated scientific discovery in machine learning with LLM agents. means that some but not all of the tasks in that benchmark require the indicated capability. Compute Constraints indicates whether the solution code must adhere to specified runtime and GPU memory limitations, an important aspect ignored by most prior work.

We curate MLRC-BENCH starting with 7 competition tasks. We pick tasks that involve novel and high-impact problems, spanning areas including LLM safety, multimodal perception, and few-shot learning. Our experimental findings reveal that even the best-performing tested LLM agents, such as gemini-exp-1206 (Pichai, 2024) under the MLAB (Huang et al., 2024a) scaffolding, closes only 9.3% of the gap between baseline and top human participant score. Additionally, our analysis highlights poor correlation between the novelty judged by LLM and practical effectiveness of agents solutions, questioning the reliability of LLM-as-a-judge for research idea evaluation. These results underscore the limitations of current AI research agents in generating and implementing innovative ML solutions, providing crucial benchmark for future advancements. Our contributions can be summarized as below: We introduce MLRC-BENCH, dynamic benchmark suite curated from ML conference competitions, featuring open research problems tha"

Existing evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents on scientific discovery lacks objective baselines and metrics to assess the viability of their proposed methods. To address this issue, we introduce MLRC-Bench, a benchmark designed to quantify how effectively language agents can tackle challenging Machine Learning (ML) Research Competitions. Our benchmark highlights open research problems that demand novel methodologies, in contrast to recent benchmarks such as OpenAI's MLE-Bench (Chan et al., 2024) and METR's RE-Bench (Wijk et al., 2024), which focus on well-established research tasks that are largely solvable through sufficient engineering effort. Unlike prior work, e.g., AI Scientist (Lu et al., 2024b), which evaluates the end-to-end agentic pipeline by using LLM-as-a-judge, MLRC-Bench measures the key steps of proposing and implementing novel research methods and evaluates them with newly proposed rigorous protocol and objective metrics. Our curated suite of 7 competition tasks reveals significant challenges for LLM agents. Even the best-performing tested agent (gemini-exp-1206 under MLAB (Huang et al., 2024a)) closes only 9.3% of the gap between baseline and top human participant scores. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a misalignment between the LLM-judged innovation and their actual performance on cutting-edge ML research problems. MLRC-Bench is a dynamic benchmark, which is designed to continually grow with new ML competitions to encourage rigorous and objective evaluations of AI's research capabilities.
