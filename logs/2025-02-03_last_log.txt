Given the recent introduction of multiple language models and the ongoing demand for improved Natural Language Processing tasks, particularly summarization, this work provides a comprehensive benchmarking of 20 recent language models, focusing on smaller ones for the news summarization task. In this work, we systematically test the capabilities and effectiveness of these models in summarizing news article texts which are written in different styles and presented in three distinct datasets. Specifically, we focus in this study on zero-shot and few-shot learning settings and we apply a robust evaluation methodology that combines different evaluation concepts including automatic metrics, human evaluation, and LLM-as-a-judge. Interestingly, including demonstration examples in the few-shot learning setting did not enhance models' performance and, in some cases, even led to worse quality of the generated summaries. This issue arises mainly due to the poor quality of the gold summaries that have been used as reference summaries, which negatively impacts the models' performance. Furthermore, our study's results highlight the exceptional performance of GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, which generally dominate due to their advanced capabilities. However, among the public models evaluated, certain models such as Qwen1.5-7B, SOLAR-10.7B-Instruct-v1.0, Meta-Llama-3-8B and Zephyr-7B-Beta demonstrated promising results. These models showed significant potential, positioning them as competitive alternatives to large models for the task of news summarization.

Test-time scaling is a promising new approach to language modeling that uses extra test-time compute to improve performance. Recently, OpenAI's o1 model showed this capability but did not publicly share its methodology, leading to many replication efforts. We seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance. First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending "Wait" multiple times to the model's generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to double-check its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps. After supervised finetuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on s1K and equipping it with budget forcing, our model s1 exceeds o1-preview on competition math questions by up to 27% (MATH and AIME24). Further, scaling s1 with budget forcing allows extrapolating beyond its performance without test-time intervention: from 50% to 57% on AIME24. Our model, data, and code are open-source at https://github.com/simplescaling/s1.
