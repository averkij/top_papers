Text:"SAeUron: Interpretable Concept Unlearning in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders Bartosz Cywi nski 1 Kamil DejaDiffusion models, while powerful, can inadvertently generate harmful or undesirable content, raising significant ethical and safety concerns. Recent machine unlearning approaches offer potential solutions but often lack transparency, making it difficult to understand the changes they introduce to the base model. In this work, we introduce SAeUron, novel method leveraging features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to remove unwanted concepts in text-to-image diffusion models. First, we demonstrate that SAEs, trained in an unsupervised manner on activations from multiple denoising timesteps of the diffusion model, capture sparse and interpretable features corresponding to specific concepts. Building on this, we propose feature selection method that enables precise interventions on model activations to block targeted content while preserving overall performance. Evaluation with the competitive UnlearnCanvas benchmark on object and style unlearning highlights SAeUrons state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we show that with single SAE, we can remove multiple concepts simultaneously and that in contrast to other methods, SAeUron mitigates the possibility of generating unwanted content, even under adversarial attack. Code and checkpoints are available at: https: //github.com/cywinski/SAeUron. 5 2 0 2 1 3 ] . [ 2 2 5 0 8 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r 1. Introduction Diffusion models (DMs) (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020) have revolutionized generative modeling, enabling the creation of highly realistic images. Despite their success, these models can inadvertently generate undesirable and harmful content, pornography (Rando et al., 1Warsaw University of Technology, Poland 2IDEAS NCBR, Correspondence to: Bartosz Cywinski <bcywinPoland. ski11@gmail.com>. Figure 1. Concept unlearning in SAeUron. We localize and remove SAE features corresponding to the unwanted concept (Cartoon) while preserving the overall performance of the diffusion model. 2022; Schramowski et al., 2023) or copyrighted images e.g. cloning the artistic styles without consent (Andersen, 2024). The straightforward solution to this problem is to retrain the model from scratch with curated data. However, such an approach, due to the enormous sizes of the training datasets is both costly and impractical. As result, growing number of works focus on removing the influence of unwanted data from already pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models through machine unlearning (MU). Most existing methods build on the basic idea of fine-tuning the model while using negative gradients for selected unwanted samples (Wu et al., 2024; Gandikota et al., 2023; Heng & Soh, 2024; Kumari et al., 2023). To minimize degradation in the overall models performance, recent techniques 1 SAeUron: Interpretable Concept Unlearning in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders restrict parameter updates to attention layers (Zhang et al., 2024a) or to their most important subsets (Fan et al., 2023; Wu & Harandi, 2024). drawback of fine-tuning-based approaches is that they offer limited understanding of how the base model changes during the process. Consequently, these methods often fail to fully remove targeted concepts and instead merely mask them, leaving the models highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks (Zhang et al., 2025). In this work, we propose conceptually different approach to unlearning in diffusion models, which we dubbed SAeUron. We first adapt sparse autoencoders (Olshausen & Field, 1997) to train them in an unsupervised way on the internal activations of the Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model. By using activations extracted from all of the denoising timesteps, our SAE learns set of sparse and semantically meaningful features. This allows us to block specific concept, by identifying features associated with it and removing them during the inference. Figure 1 visualizes this idea. While the sparsity of SAE features ensures that unlearning of one concept has limited influence on the remaining ones, we additionally demonstrate that the concept-specific features targeted by our approach are interpretable. As result, we can analyze them prior to unlearning, (e.g. by highlighting their activation areas or annotating them) which significantly enhances the transparency of our approach compared to other methods. We evaluate our method on the recently proposed large and competitive unlearning benchmark UnlearnCanvas (Zhang et al., 2024b) which assesses unlearning effectiveness across 20 objects and 50 styles. We train two SAE models one for styles and one for objects each using activations gathered from single selected SD block and show that our blocking approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in unlearning without affecting the overall performance of the diffusion model. Importantly, due to the fact that SAEs are trained in an unsupervised way, SAeUron is highly robust to adversarial attacks and seamlessly scales to removing multiple concepts simultaneously, contrary to other methods. The summary of our contributions is as follows: We demonstrate that sparse autoencoders extract meaningful and interpretable features from the internal activations of diffusion models across multiple denoising timesteps. We propose SAeUron, an interpretable unlearning method that localizes features corresponding to unwanted concepts and ablates them, achieving state-ofthe-art performance. We demonstrate that SAeUron enables seamless unlearning of multiple concepts simultaneously and exhibits high robustness against adversarial attacks. 2. Related Work 2.1. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) Sparse autoencoders (Olshausen & Field, 1997) are neural networks designed to learn compact and interpretable representations of data by encouraging sparsity in the latent space. This is achieved by incorporating sparsity penalty into the reconstruction loss, ensuring that only small fraction of latent neurons activate for any given input. Recently, SAEs have emerged as an effective tool in the field of mechanistic interpretability, enabling the discovery of features corresponding to human-interpretable concepts (Huben et al., 2024; Bricken et al., 2023) and sparse feature circuits within language models (Marks et al., 2024). In this study, sparse autoencoders are used within text-to-image diffusion models to identify"

Diffusion models, while powerful, can inadvertently generate harmful or undesirable content, raising significant ethical and safety concerns. Recent machine unlearning approaches offer potential solutions but often lack transparency, making it difficult to understand the changes they introduce to the base model. In this work, we introduce SAeUron, a novel method leveraging features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to remove unwanted concepts in text-to-image diffusion models. First, we demonstrate that SAEs, trained in an unsupervised manner on activations from multiple denoising timesteps of the diffusion model, capture sparse and interpretable features corresponding to specific concepts. Building on this, we propose a feature selection method that enables precise interventions on model activations to block targeted content while preserving overall performance. Evaluation with the competitive UnlearnCanvas benchmark on object and style unlearning highlights SAeUron's state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we show that with a single SAE, we can remove multiple concepts simultaneously and that in contrast to other methods, SAeUron mitigates the possibility of generating unwanted content, even under adversarial attack. Code and checkpoints are available at: https://github.com/cywinski/SAeUron.

Он использует разреженные автоэнкодеры (SAE) для выделения интерпретируемых признаков, соответствующих конкретным концепциям. Метод позволяет точно вмешиваться в активации модели для блокировки целевого контента при сохранении общей производительности. SAeUron показывает лучшие результаты по сравнению с другими методами и может удалять несколько концепций одновременно.",
