[ 1 9 3 3 9 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r Abstract Existing foundation models typically process visual input as pixels and textual input as tokens, paradigm that contrasts with human perception, where both modalities are processed in unified manner. With the rise of embodied and agentic AI, where inputs primarily come from camera pixels, the need for unified perception framework becomes increasingly evident. In this paper, we propose to unify all modalities (text, tables, code, diagrams, images, etc) as pixel inputs, i.e. Perceive Everything as Pixels (PEAP). We introduce PIXELWORLD, novel evaluation suite that unifies all the mentioned modalities into pixel space to gauge the existing models performance. Our findings show that (1) PEAP outperforms baseline with token-based input in multimodal datasets, benefiting from unified input for better disambiguation, (2) significant declines in reasoning and coding capabilities across all models when processing pixel-based input, underscoring the need to enhance foundation models perceptual abilities, (3) larger models can maintain strong performance on non-reasoning tasks under PEAP, while smaller models like Phi-3.5-V suffer significant performance degradation, (4) the attention pattern of PEAP is highly aligned with text token input, (5) PEAP can be accelerated significantly by exploiting the spatial sparsity. We conclude that the existing frontier models are competent in pixel perception, however, there is still headroom for improvement in the future work. 1.

Both plots show wsd and cosine schedule with different training lengths , and with base learning-rate of cosine being twice as large as for wsd. under the name wsd (warmup-stable-decay). One distinguishing feature of wsd is the drastic decrease of the loss shortly after initiating the cooldown. However, the recent advancements in learning-rate scheduling have emerged almost exclusively from empirical rather than from theoretical considerations (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017; Goyal et al., 2017; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Hagele et al., 2024). We do not yet have fundamental understanding that could explain the features of the above-mentioned schedules and why they perform better or worse at given task, restraining the tuning procedure to trial-and-error approach. Summary and contributions. In this paper, we show that several empirical findings on scheduling can be reproduced with suboptimality bound for SGD on convex problems that was introduced by Defazio et al. (2023). Among others, this theory allows to reproduce (i) the matching performance of cosine and wsd; (ii) the necessity and optimal length of the cooldown period in the end of training (see Section 4). In second step, we take the reverse direction and show how the theoretical bound can be exploited in practice (see Section 5): for continued training of 124M and 210M Llamastyle model, using the theoretically optimal schedule notably improves performance compared to continuing with the same learning rate; moreover, it allows to transfer the optimal learning-rate across schedules (Figs. 10 and 12). This leads us to the perhaps surprising conclusion that the empirical behavior of learning-rate schedules in (non-convex) deep learning can be described precisely with theoretical bound from non-smooth stochastic convex optimization. particular focus of this paper is put on the wsd schedule: we derive convergence result for this schedule (without warmup) in the non-smooth stochastic convex setting, see Section 3.2. Most importantly, the cooldown period of wsd leads to vanishing log-terms in the bound, which provides an explanation of the benefit of cooldown observed in practice. 2 Second, we show that the sudden drop of the loss during cooldown can be observed in upper and lower bounds of the suboptimality, as well as for non-smooth convex toy problem. Code for all experiments is available at https://github.com/fabian-sp/ lr-scheduling. Setup. We consider the training problem (x), (x) := Es[f (x, s)]. (1) min Rd Rd are the learnable parameters of machine learning model, and In the above, is loss function. The expectation is taken over the distribution of random variable , s) has (typically the training set). We assume that ( that maps to the space or set suitable subdifferential for every (for example, see Rockafellar (1970); Clarke (1983); Bolte & Pauwels (2021)). We denote elements of the subdifferential as (x, s). We study the iterates of SGD with learning-rate schedule, given by γηtgt, xt+1 = xt gt Here, γ > 0 is called the base learning-rate and ηt > 0 is called the schedule. While it might seem redundant to separate γ from (ηt), this reflects the standard practice in deep learning libraries such as Pytorch. Most importantly, for different schedules (constant, cosine, wsd,. . . ), the optimal value of γ is in general different. (xt, st), (2) N. We remark that the most commonly used optimizer for training in practice is Adam(W) (Kingma & Ba, 2015; Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019), and all empirical results we present or refer to in this paper are obtained with Adam(W). However, the theoretical results apply to SGD; we address this limitation in detail in Section 6. Cosine and wsd schedule. We now formally introduce the two running examples cosine and wsd. Without warmup, the wsd schedule is constant up to iteration T0 , then decays linearly to zero. Formally, we have ηt = 1 1 (cid:40) T0 + T0 1 T0 < T0, + 1. (3) 2(1 + cos( The cosine schedule is given by ηt = 1 + 1. Note that for both schedules we have ηT +1 = 0 (we choose + 1 in order to ensure that ηt > 0 for ). We remark"

"Existing foundation models typically process visual input as pixels and textual input as tokens, a paradigm that contrasts with human perception, where both modalities are processed in a unified manner. With the rise of embodied and agentic AI, where inputs primarily come from camera pixels, the need for a unified perception framework becomes increasingly evident. In this paper, we propose to unify all modalities (text, tables, code, diagrams, images, etc) as pixel inputs, i.e. "Perceive Everything as Pixels" (PEAP). We introduce PixelWorld, a novel evaluation suite that unifies all the mentioned modalities into pixel space to gauge the existing models' performance. Our findings show that (1) PEAP outperforms baseline with token-based input in multimodal datasets, benefiting from unified input for better disambiguation, (2) significant declines in reasoning and coding capabilities across all models when processing pixel-based input, underscoring the need to enhance foundation models' perceptual abilities, (3) larger models can maintain strong performance on non-reasoning tasks under PEAP, while smaller models like Phi-3.5-V suffer significant performance degradation, (4) the attention pattern of PEAP is highly aligned with text token input, (5) PEAP can be accelerated significantly by exploiting the spatial sparsity. We conclude that the existing frontier models are competent in pixel perception, however, there is still headroom for improvement. Our code, dataset will be released upon acceptance."

We show that learning-rate schedules for large model training behave surprisingly similar to a performance bound from non-smooth convex optimization theory. We provide a bound for the constant schedule with linear cooldown; in particular, the practical benefit of cooldown is reflected in the bound due to the absence of logarithmic terms. Further, we show that this surprisingly close match between optimization theory and practice can be exploited for learning-rate tuning: we achieve noticeable improvements for training 124M and 210M Llama-type models by (i) extending the schedule for continued training with optimal learning-rate, and (ii) transferring the optimal learning-rate across schedules.
