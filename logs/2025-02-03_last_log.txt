Due to the presence of the natural gap between Knowledge Graph (KG) structures and the natural language, the effective integration of holistic structural information of KGs with Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a significant question. To this end, we propose a two-stage framework to learn and apply quantized codes for each entity, aiming for the seamless integration of KGs with LLMs. Firstly, a self-supervised quantized representation (SSQR) method is proposed to compress both KG structural and semantic knowledge into discrete codes (\ie, tokens) that align the format of language sentences. We further design KG instruction-following data by viewing these learned codes as features to directly input to LLMs, thereby achieving seamless integration. The experiment results demonstrate that SSQR outperforms existing unsupervised quantized methods, producing more distinguishable codes. Further, the fine-tuned LLaMA2 and LLaMA3.1 also have superior performance on KG link prediction and triple classification tasks, utilizing only 16 tokens per entity instead of thousands in conventional prompting methods.

Task-generic promptable image segmentation aims to achieve segmentation of diverse samples under a single task description by utilizing only one task-generic prompt. Current methods leverage the generalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to infer instance-specific prompts from these task-generic prompts in order to guide the segmentation process. However, when VLMs struggle to generalise to some image instances, predicting instance-specific prompts becomes poor. To solve this problem, we introduce Instance-specific Negative Mining for Task-Generic Promptable Segmentation (INT). The key idea of INT is to adaptively reduce the influence of irrelevant (negative) prior knowledge whilst to increase the use the most plausible prior knowledge, selected by negative mining with higher contrast, in order to optimise instance-specific prompts generation. Specifically, INT consists of two components: (1) instance-specific prompt generation, which progressively fliters out incorrect information in prompt generation; (2) semantic mask generation, which ensures each image instance segmentation matches correctly the semantics of the instance-specific prompts. INT is validated on six datasets, including camouflaged objects and medical images, demonstrating its effectiveness, robustness and scalability.
