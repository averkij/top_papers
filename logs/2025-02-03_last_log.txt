Text:"Scalable-Softmax Is Superior for Attention Ken M. Nakanishi 1 5 2 0 2 1 3 ] . [ 1 9 9 3 9 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r aThe maximum element of the vector output by the Softmax function approaches zero as the input vector size increases. Transformer-based language models rely on Softmax to compute attention scores, causing the attention distribution to flatten as the context size grows. This reduces the models ability to prioritize key information effectively and potentially limits its length generalization. To address this problem, we propose Scalable-Softmax (SSMax), which replaces Softmax in scenarios where the input vector size varies. SSMax can be seamlessly integrated into existing Transformer-based architectures. Experimental results in language modeling show that models using SSMax not only achieve faster loss reduction during pretraining but also significantly improve performance in long contexts and key information retrieval. Furthermore, an analysis of attention scores reveals that SSMax enables the model to focus attention on key information even in long contexts. Additionally, although models that use SSMax from the beginning of pretraining achieve better length generalization, those that have already started pretraining can still gain some of this ability by replacing Softmax in the attention layers with SSMax, either during or after pretraining. 1. Introduction Length generalization, the ability to handle longer context sizes than those used during training, is key challenge for Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) (Vaswani et al., 2017; Kazemnejad et al., 2023). Processing longer contexts enhances LLMs ability to leverage in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020) and chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022). However, the computational and memory requirements for training Transformers grow quadrat1Institute for Physics of Intelligence, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan. Correspondence to: Ken M. Nakanishi <ken-nakanishi@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp>. Figure 1. Comparison of Softmax and SSMax, illustrating the issue of attention fading and the effectiveness of SSMax in preventing it. As the input vector size increases, the maximum value of the output vector produced by Softmax decreases, demonstrating the problem of attention fading. In contrast, SSMax keeps the maximum value close to 1, regardless of the input size. The input vector consists of -2 for all elements except the last, which is set to +3. The scaling parameter of SSMax is set to 0.43. ically with context size, imposing practical limits on the context sizes used during training. Consequently, LLMs must acquire the ability to generalize to longer context sizes beyond those seen during training. There are four primary approaches to addressing length generalization: improving positional encoding methods (Wei et al., 2022; Press et al., 2021; Su et al., 2024; Kazemnejad et al., 2023; Shaw et al., 2018), adopting sparse attention mechanisms (Ainslie et al., 2020; Gupta & Berant, 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2021; Sukhbaatar et al., 2019), further training on longer contexts after modifying positional encodings (Liu et al., 2024b;a; Ye et al., 2024), and enhancing attention mechanisms (Ye et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024). This work focuses on enhancing attention mechanisms as an approach to address length generalization, specifically by replacing the Softmax function within the attention layers of Transformers. Softmax converts an input vector into vector that can be interpreted as probability distribution, where all elements are non-negative and sum to one. In deep learning, Softmax is commonly used in multi-class classification tasks to convert logits into probability distribution (LeCun et al., 1998). In the attention layers of Transformer-based language models, 1 Scalable-Softmax Is Superior for Attention Softmax computes probability distribution over all tokens in the context, determining how much attention is allocated to each token (Vaswani et al., 2017). Unlike the Softmax used in classification tasks, where the input vector size is fixed, the Softmax in attention layers has an input vector size that varies with the context size. The denominator of Softmax is the sum of the exponentials of all input elements, and its value increases as the context size grows, due to the larger number of input elements. In contrast, the numerator, the exponential of single input element, is independent of the input vector size. As the input vector size grows, the resulting probability distribution becomes increasingly flat. In this paper, we refer to this phenomenon as attention fading, which we hypothesize reduces the models ability to focus on key tokens in the context, thereby limiting length generalization. To address this issue, we propose Scalable-Softmax (SSMax), novel alternative to Softmax in attention layers that mitigates attention fading and enhances length generalization. SSMax transforms an input vector into probability distribution, similar to Softmax, but avoids attention fading even for large input vector sizes. Figure 1 illustrates the effectiveness of SSMax, contrasting it with Softmax, which suffers from attention fading. The name Scalable-Softmax reflects its ability to handle varying input vector sizes while preventing attention fading. Note that Scalable does not refer to the scaling parameter s, which will be introduced later. Additionally, as shown in Section 2.3, SSMax integrates seamlessly into existing architectures with minimal code modifications, maintaining compatibility and efficiency. In this study, we conducted several evaluations to assess the effectiveness of SSMax in improving Transformer performance. First, we compared the learning curves of Transformer models during pretraining and found that those with SSMax consistently achieved lower loss values compared to the standard Transformer. In all subsequent evaluations, we modified RoPEs θ to 50 times its training value without additional training, allowing us to assess the models ability to generalize to large context sizes under this drastic change. Second, unlike the standard Transformer, models with SSMax maintained significantly lower loss values even as the context size increased well beyond the training sequence length. Third, in key information retrieval tasks, models with SSMax retrieved key information reasonably accurately, even when the context s"

"The maximum element of the vector output by the Softmax function approaches zero as the input vector size increases. Transformer-based language models rely on Softmax to compute attention scores, causing the attention distribution to flatten as the context size grows. This reduces the model's ability to prioritize key information effectively and potentially limits its length generalization. To address this problem, we propose Scalable-Softmax (SSMax), which replaces Softmax in scenarios where the input vector size varies. SSMax can be seamlessly integrated into existing Transformer-based architectures. Experimental results in language modeling show that models using SSMax not only achieve faster loss reduction during pretraining but also significantly improve performance in long contexts and key information retrieval. Furthermore, an analysis of attention scores reveals that SSMax enables the model to focus attention on key information even in long contexts. Additionally, although models that use SSMax from the beginning of pretraining achieve better length generalization, those that have already started pretraining can still gain some of this ability by replacing Softmax in the attention layers with SSMax, either during or after pretraining."
