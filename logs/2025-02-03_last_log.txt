Figure 1. Test-time scaling with s1-32B. We benchmark s1-32B on reasoning-intensive tasks and vary test-time compute. of this approach is to increase the compute at test time to get better results. There has been much work exploring this idea (Snell et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024b; Welleck et al., 2024), and the viability of this paradigm was recently validated by OpenAI o1 (OpenAI, 2024). o1 has demonstrated strong reasoning performance with consistent gains from scaling test-time compute. OpenAI describes their approach as using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) implying the use of sizable amounts of data (OpenAI, 2024). This has led to various attempts to replicate their models relying on techniques like Monte Carlo Tree Search (Gao et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024a), multi-agent approaches (Huang et al., 2024b), and others (Huang et al., 2024b; Gao et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024a). Among these approaches, DeepSeek R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) has successfully replicated o1-level performance, also employing reinforcement learning via millions of samples and multiple training stages. However, despite the large number of o1 replication attempts, none have openly replicated clear test-time scaling behavior. Thus, we ask: what is the simplest approach to achieve both test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance? We show that training on only 1,000 samples with next-token prediction and controlling thinking duration via simple test-time technique we refer to as budget forcing leads to strong reasoning model that scales in performance with more test-time compute. Specifically, we construct s1K, which consists of 1,000 carefully curated questions paired with reasoning traces and answers distilled from Gemini Thinking Experimental (Google, 2024). We perform super1 s1: Simple test-time scaling vised fine-tuning (SFT) of an off-the-shelf pretrained model on our small dataset requiring just 26 minutes of training on 16 H100 GPUs. After training, we control the amount of test-time compute our model spends using budget forcing: (I) If the model generates more thinking tokens than desired limit, we forcefully end the thinking process by appending an end-of-thinking token delimiter. Ending the thinking this way makes the model transition to generating its answer. (II) If we want the model to spend more test-time compute on problem, we suppress the generation of the end-of-thinking token delimiter and instead append Wait to the models current reasoning trace to encourage more exploration. Equipped with this simple recipe SFT on 1,000 samples and test-time budget forcing our model s132B exhibits test-time scaling (Figure 1). Further, s1-32B is the most sample-efficient reasoning model and outperforms closed-source models like OpenAIs o1-preview (Figure 2). We conduct extensive ablation experiments targeting (a) our selection of 1,000 (1K) reasoning samples and (b) our testtime scaling. For (a), we find that jointly incorporating difficulty, diversity, and quality measures into our selection algorithm is important. Random selection, selecting samples with the longest reasoning traces, or only selecting maximally diverse samples all lead to significantly worse performance (around 30% on AIME24 on average). Training on our full data pool of 59K examples, superset of s1K, does not offer substantial gains over our 1K selection. This highlights the importance of careful data selection and echoes prior findings for instruction tuning (Zhou et al., 2023). For (b), we define desiderata for test-time scaling methods to compare different approaches. Budget forcing leads to the best scaling as it has perfect controllability with clear positive slope leading to strong performance. In summary, our contributions are: We develop simple methods for creating sample-efficient reasoning dataset (2) and test-time scaling (3); Based on these we build s1-32B which is competitive with o1-preview (4); We ablate subtleties of data (5.1) and test-time scaling (5.2). We end with discussion to motivate future work on simple reasoning (6). Our code, model, and data will be open-source. 2.

Wojciech Zaremba Evgenia Nitishinskaya Boaz Barak Stephanie Lin Sam Toyer Rachel Dias Eric Wallace Johannes Heidecke Amelia Glaese Yaodong Yu Kai XiaoWe conduct experiments on the impact of increasing inference-time compute in reasoning models (specifically OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini) on their robustness to adversarial attacks. We find that across variety of attacks, increased inference-time compute leads to improved robustness. In many cases (with important exceptions), the fraction of model samples where the attack succeeds tends to zero as the amount of test-time compute grows. We perform no adversarial training for the tasks we study, and we increase inference-time compute by simply allowing the models to spend more compute on reasoning, independently of the form of attack. Our results suggest that inference-time compute has the potential to improve adversarial robustness for Large Language Models. We also explore new attacks directed at reasoning models, as well as settings where inference-time compute does not improve reliability, and speculate on the reasons for these as well as ways to address them.Artificial Intelligence has seen many great successes over the last years, but adversarial robustness remains one of the few stubborn problems where progress has been limited. While imageclassification models with super-human performance on ImageNet have been known for nearly decade (He et al., 2016), current classifiers still get fooled by attacks that change the input images by imperceptible amounts. In recent talk, Nicholas Carlini summed up the state of the field by saying that in adversarial machine learning, we wrote over 9,000 papers in ten years and got nowhere (Carlini, 2024). In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), the situation is not much better, with jailbreaks and other attacks known for all top models (Zou et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023; Andriushchenko et al., 2024, ...). As LLMs are increasingly applied as agents (that is, browsing the web, executing code, and other applications) they expose novel attack surfaces. In all these applications, LLMs are often ingesting inputs of different modalities provided by potentially untrusted parties. Meanwhile their adversarial robustness is increasingly critical as they are able to perform actions with potentially harmful side effects in the real world (Greshake et al., 2023; Toyer et al., 2024). Ensuring that agentic models function reliably when browsing the web, sending emails, or uploading code to repositories can be seen as analogous to ensuring that self-driving cars drive without accidents. As in the case of self-driving cars, an agent forwarding wrong email or creating security vulnerabilities may well have far-reaching real-world consequences. Moreover, LLM agents face an additional challenge from adversaries which are rarely present in the self-driving case. Adversarial entities could control some of the inputs that these agents encounter while browsing the web, or reading files and images (Schulhoff et al., 2023). For example, PromptArmor (2024) recently demonstrated that an attacker can extract confidential data from private channels by embedding ma- *Equal contribution.

As LLMs grow in capabilities, the potential implications for this lack of robustness are ever more significant. The state of the art in adversarial robustness is currently achieved via adversarial training (Madry et al., 2018), by which, rather than training model to minimize standard expected loss minf Ex,yD[L(f (x), y)], the objective has the form minf Ex,yD[maxtT L(f (t(x)), y)] where is some set of transformations that do not change the label of the input. One drawback of this approach is that it is computationally expensive. But more fundamentally, adversarial training requires knowledge of the perturbation set of applicable transformations that the adversary may use. We cannot know in advance the set of possible attacks: while safety policies allow us to classify perturbation as changing the label or not, we cant efficiently explore the space of such perturbations priori. Thus the state of LLM safety against jailbreaks resembles game of whack-a-mole, where model developers train their models against currently known attacks, only for attackers to discover new ones. Scaling inference-time compute. While in other AI applications, we have seen improvements across multiple downstream tasks purely from scaling up pre-training compute, such scaling (without adversarial training) has provided limited (if any) improvements for adversarial robustness. In particular, as discussed above, while models have massively increased in scale, advances in adversarial robustness have been much more limited.1 In this work, we give initial evidence that the situation is different when scaling inference-time compute. We show that across multiple attack surfaces, increasing inference-time compute significantly improves the robustness of reasoning LLMs (specifically OpenAIs o1-preview and o1-mini). We stress that we do this without performing adversarial training against the attacks and datasets we study, and do not provide the model with information on the nature of the attack. Moreover, unlike typical adversarial robustness settings, where interventions to increase robustness often degrade clean (non-adversarial) performance, increasing inference-time compute improves performance of the model across the board (OpenAI, 2024). While much more research is needed (see limitations section below), our work suggests that by shifting towards scaling inference-time compute, we may be able to unlock the benefits of scale in adversarial contexts as well. Contributions of this work include: 1. New attacks for reasoning models: We propose an adaptation of soft-token attacks suitable for attacking reasoning models. We also introduce novel attack (think-less) and hypothesize possible novel strategy (nerd-sniping) for attacking reasoning models. 2. Empirical robustness benefits of scaling inference-time compute: We measure robustness as function of attacker and defender investment over wide range of domains and attacker strategies. We find robustness improves with inference-time compute over many of these domains and attacker strategies. 3. Limitations of current"

Test-time scaling is a promising new approach to language modeling that uses extra test-time compute to improve performance. Recently, OpenAI's o1 model showed this capability but did not publicly share its methodology, leading to many replication efforts. We seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance. First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending "Wait" multiple times to the model's generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to double-check its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps. After supervised finetuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on s1K and equipping it with budget forcing, our model s1 exceeds o1-preview on competition math questions by up to 27% (MATH and AIME24). Further, scaling s1 with budget forcing allows extrapolating beyond its performance without test-time intervention: from 50% to 57% on AIME24.

We conduct experiments on the impact of increasing inference-time compute in reasoning models (specifically OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini) on their robustness to adversarial attacks. We find that across a variety of attacks, increased inference-time compute leads to improved robustness. In many cases (with important exceptions), the fraction of model samples where the attack succeeds tends to zero as the amount of test-time compute grows. We perform no adversarial training for the tasks we study, and we increase inference-time compute by simply allowing the models to spend more compute on reasoning, independently of the form of attack. Our results suggest that inference-time compute has the potential to improve adversarial robustness for Large Language Models. We also explore new attacks directed at reasoning models, as well as settings where inference-time compute does not improve reliability, and speculate on the reasons for these as well as ways to address them.
