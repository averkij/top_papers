Text:"Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding for Efficient LLM Reasoning Baohao Liao * 1 Yuhui Xu * 2 Hanze Dong * 2 Junnan Li 2 Christof Monz 1 Silvio Savarese 2 Doyen Sahoo 2 Caiming Xiong 2 5 2 0 2 1 3 ] . [ 1 4 2 3 9 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r aWe introduce Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD), novel framework aimed at improving the efficiency of inference in large language models (LLMs). RSD synergistically combines lightweight draft model with more powerful target model, incorporating controlled bias to prioritize high-reward outputs, in contrast to existing speculative decoding methods that enforce strict unbiasedness. RSD employs process reward model to evaluate intermediate decoding steps and dynamically decide whether to invoke the target model, optimizing the trade-off between computational cost and output quality. We theoretically demonstrate that threshold-based mixture strategy achieves an optimal balance between resource utilization and performance. Extensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including Olympiad-level tasks, show that RSD delivers significant efficiency gains against decoding with the target model only (up to 4.4 fewer FLOPs), while achieving significant better accuracy than parallel decoding method on average (up to +3.5). These results highlight RSD as robust and cost-effective approach for deploying LLMs in resource-intensive scenarios. 1. Introduction Scaling laws are widely recognized by the machine learning community as foundational principle for the development of large language models (Hestness et al., 2017; Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022). They emphasize that increasing both model size and dataset scale leads to improved loss reduction and, consequently, enhanced generalization capabilities. When data and model size are scaled to extraordinary levels, performance can reach unprecedented heights. Large models demonstrate remarkable capabilities *Equal contribution 1Language Technology Lab, University of Amsterdam 2Salesforce AI Research. Correspondence to: Yuhui Xu <yuhui.xu@salesforce.com>. 1 across diverse tasks, showcasing robust generalization and advanced reasoning skills (Brown et al., 2020; Hurst et al., 2024; Anthropic, 2024; Team et al., 2024). These advancements result in high computational and economic costs. While training is resource-intensive, inference at scale is even costlier, requiring vast computational infrastructure and energy to serve billions of queries (Patterson et al., 2021). The exponential growth in inference costs makes it key challenge for large model deployment, highlighting the need for efficient techniques (Frantar et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2024a; Xu et al., 2024; Liao & Monz, 2024; Liao et al., 2024a) to reduce energy use and ensure scalability. Specifically, Sequential token generation in large LLMs incurs significantly higher computational costs compared to smaller models. This increased latency can hinder their deployment in real-time or high-throughput applications. To address this issue, parallel decoding techniques, such as speculative decoding, have emerged as effective solutions (Leviathan et al., 2023). Speculative decoding operates by leveraging smaller, lightweight model to generate candidate outputs, which are then validated and refined by the larger model. This approach significantly reduces the number of decoding tokens required by the large model, thereby accelerating the overall process. The smaller model serves as guide, proposing sequences that the larger model can confirm or adjust, leading to faster inference times without compromising quality. Furthermore, speculative decoding ensures efficiency by maintaining high-quality outputs through careful calibration of the smaller model. By aligning the smaller models predictions with the larger models capabilities, this method minimizes discrepancies and enhances reliability during inference. Despite advancements in parallel decoding, speculative decoding remains underutilized for complex reasoning tasks, particularly multi-step generation. key limitation is the strict unbiasedness requirement, which ensures the final token distribution matches the large models but restricts flexibility in exploring diverse completions (Holtzman et al., 2020). While unbiasedness maintains theoretical fidelity, it often reduces efficiency, especially when the draft model diReward-Guided Speculative Decoding for Efficient LLM Reasoning Figure 1. Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD). This diagram illustrates how RSD improves upon standard speculative decoding (SD) by incorporating reward-guided selection. SD strictly enforces exact token matching between the draft and target model, leading to unnecessary computations when mismatched tokens are discarded. In contrast, RSD evaluates draft outputs based on reward signals and selectively refines them, reducing reliance on exact matching and improving efficiency. The process starts with small and fast draft model generating preliminary results, followed by larger and more reliable target model verifying and refining predictions. Darker background regions indicate higher computational costs, showing how SD wastes resources on rejected tokens, whereas RSD reduces unnecessary steps by accepting useful draft outputs even when they do not exactly match, balancing efficiency and accuracy. verges from the large model. High-quality tokens (e.g., those favored by process reward) may still be rejected if their probabilities under the large model are too low, leading to wasted computation and negating potential speedups. This dependence inflates overhead and limits speculative decodings benefits, particularly in long-trajectory reasoning tasks like math and coding. Allowing controlled bias, where the final distribution deviates slightly from the large model, can improve performance. If draft token is correct but does not match the large models distribution exactly, strict rejection is counterproductive. Reward-guided acceptance retains valuable partial solutions, reduces unnecessary queries, and can even surpass the large models performance. Thus, more adaptive approaches are needed to balance efficiency and robustness, ensuring broader real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD), novel framework that balances efficiency and accuracy by integrating computationally lightweight draft evaluations"
