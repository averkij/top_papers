The results suggest that our proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides new path toward building truly collaborative embodied agents. I. INTRODUCTION Embodied agents are intelligent systems designed to perceive and act within the physical world. Unlike systems that only solve abstract problems in virtual space, embodied agents must navigate the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments [1]. In real-world scenarios, embodied agents face an extra challenge not present in virtual environments collaboration with humans. Collaboration behavior refers to the agents ability to communicate, coordinate, and adapt its actions based on human feedback. denotes the corresponding author 1College of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. 2Shanghai Innovation Institute, Shanghai, China. 3Mechanical Systems Control Lab, UC Berkeley, California, USA. Fig. 1: Difference between the executor and the collaborator. The executor passively follows instructions, which may lead to failure. In contrast, the collaborator actively communicates with the user to understand the intended instruction and successfully complete the task. Thus, the ultimate goal of embodied agents is to create collaborators that can actively interact with humans in the real-world environment, not mere executors that passively follow instructions. For decades, central goal in robotics has been to create such versatile and adaptive agents [2, 3, 4]. Recently, the emergence of large-scale pre-trained VisionLanguage Models has offered promising path forward. key focus of current research is leveraging these powerful VLMs to create VLAs. By building on the vast, internet-scale knowledge of VLMs, VLAs have shown great potential for developing generalist embodied agents in the real world. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate as passive executors in simple, one-way mode. They receive an instruction and execute it without any feedback or clarification, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. Consider common household scenario: person asks robot to Give me the mug when multiple mugs are on the table. An ideal agent would resolve this ambiguity by interacting with the user to identify the correct mug. In contrast, current agents are likely to pick one at random without asking for clarification or simply fail to execute. This limitation prevents them from being truly collaborative and reliable partners in real-world settings. To address this ambiguity problem, researchers have begun to explore collaborative embodied agents. Prior works [5, 6, 7] study human-robot interaction to resolve ambiguity in the instruction. For example, ASK-TO-ACT [7] fine-tunes VLM to ask questions to resolve ambiguity and control the robot with set of oracle high-level actions. DialFRED [5] enables an agent to actively ask questions to the human user to better complete its task in the simulation environment. TEACh [6] introduces dataset of human-human, interactive dialogues to complete household tasks in simulation. Despite this progress, existing solutions have some limthey primarily operate in simulation enviitations. First, ronments, not the real world. Second, they rely on highlevel actions, such as MoveRight and PickUpObj. This reliance on high-level actions is insufficient for complex tasks that require fine-grained manipulation, like those in household or factory settings. Furthermore, high-level actions require an additional planner to translate commands into robot translation. In contrast, low-level actions allow for direct control and end-to-end learning, potentially enabling the discovery of novel and more efficient skills. In this paper, we address these limitations and build collaborative embodied agent by proposing the Ask-toClarify framework. The framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking clarifying questions in multi-turn dialogue and then generates low-level actions end-to-end for embodied tasks. Instead of passively following commands, our framework actively engages with human users. When faced with"

The paper provides a comprehensive guide and introduces BaseReward, a state-of-the-art multimodal reward model, which outperforms existing models across various benchmarks and real-world tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs) are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM development pipeline, including reward modeling paradigms (e.g., Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), reward head architecture, training strategies, data curation (covering over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), backbone model and model scale, and ensemble methods.   Based on these experimental insights, we introduce BaseReward, a powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone, featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench, outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the next generation of MLLMs.

AI-generated summary 				 The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs) are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM development pipeline, including reward modeling paradigms (e.g., Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), reward head architecture, training strategies, data curation (covering over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), backbone model and model scale, and ensemble methods.   Based on these experimental insights, we introduce BaseReward, a powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone, featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench, outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the next generation of MLLMs."

SpatialGen, a multi-view multi-modal diffusion model, generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes using a large synthetic dataset, outperforming previous methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency, and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a 3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the field of indoor scene understanding and generation.

The Ask-to-Clarify framework uses a VLM for collaboration and a diffusion model for action generation, enabling embodied agents to handle ambiguous instructions through multi-turn dialogue and outperform existing VLAs in real-world tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The ultimate goal of embodied agents is to create collaborators that can interact with humans, not mere executors that passively follow instructions. This requires agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt their actions based on human feedback. Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this goal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way mode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This approach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous. In this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a multi-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end. Specifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM for collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection module that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the VLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable conditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward collaborative embodied agents.

We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward collaborative embodied agents."
