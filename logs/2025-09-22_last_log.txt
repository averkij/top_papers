Text:"WHISTLE: DEEPLY SUPERVISED, TEXT-ONLY DOMAIN ADAPTATION FOR PRETRAINED SPEECH RECOGNITION TRANSFORMERS Akshat Pandey,1 Karun Kumar,1 Raphael Tang2 1Comcast Applied AI 2University College London 5 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 2 5 4 0 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r ABSTRACT Pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models such as Whisper perform well but still need domain adaptation to handle unseen vocabulary and parlance. In many real-world settings, collecting speech data is impractical, necessitating text-only adaptation. We propose WhisTLE, deeply supervised, text-only adaptation method for pretrained encoder decoder ASR models. WhisTLE trains variational autoencoder (VAE) to model encoder outputs from text and finetunes the decoder using the learned text-to-latent encoder, optionally combined with text-to-speech (TTS) adaptation. At inference, the original encoder is restored, incurring no extra runtime cost. Across four out-of-domain datasets and four ASR models, WhisTLE with TTS reduces word error rate (WER) by 12.3% relative to TTS-only adaptation and outperforms all non-WhisTLE baselines in 27 of 32 scenarios. 1. INTRODUCTION Although state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models such as Whisper [1] are trained on hundreds of thousands of hours of speechtext pairs, they still benefit from domain adaptation, especially if the target domain contains words unseen in the source domain. Unfortunately, gathering speech in the target domain may be infeasible, either financially or otherwise, limiting us to text-only adaptation. Furthermore, using pretrained ASR models precludes us from applying model architectures that afford text-only training [25], as those require training from scratch. This problem is not merely an academic artifact: in real-world deployment, users continuously evolve and speak new words and parlance, reducing ASR effectiveness. standard text-only adaptation approach called shallow fusion is to train an auxiliary language model (LM) over the target domain"

[ 1 7 3 9 5 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r Robotic real-world reinforcement learning (RL) with vision-language-action (VLA) models is bottlenecked by sparse, handcrafted rewards and inefficient exploration. We introduce VLAC, general process reward model built upon InternVL and trained on large scale heterogeneous datasets. Given pairwise observations and language goal, it outputs dense progress delta and done signal, eliminating task-specific reward engineering, and supports one-shot in-context transfer to unseen tasks and environments. VLAC is trained on visionlanguage datasets to strengthen perception, dialogic and reasoning capabilities, together with robot and human trajectories data that ground action generation and progress estimation, and additionally strengthened to reject irrelevant prompts as well as detect regression or stagnation by constructing large numbers of negative and semantically mismatched samples. With prompt control, single VLAC model alternately generating reward and action tokens, unifying critic and policy. Deployed inside an asynchronous real-world RL loop, we layer graded human-in-the-loop protocol (offline demonstration replay, return and explore, human guided explore) that accelerates exploration and stabilizes early learning. Across four distinct real-world manipulation tasks, VLAC lifts success rates from about 30% to about 90% within 200 real-world interaction episodes; incorporating human-in-the-loop interventions yields further 50% improvement in sample efficiency and achieves up to 100% final success.

A graph-driven framework called ZeroRepo uses the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) to generate complete software repositories from scratch, significantly outperforming existing baselines in terms of code size, functional coverage, and test pass rate.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models excel at function- and file-level code generation, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This process demands coherent and reliable planning across proposal- and implementation-level stages, while natural language, due to its ambiguity and verbosity, is ill-suited for faithfully representing complex software structures. To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level planning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit blueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository generation from scratch. It operates in three stages: proposal-level planning and implementation-level refinement to construct the graph, followed by graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate this setting, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC, roughly 3.9times the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64times other baselines. It attains 81.5% functional coverage and a 69.7% pass rate, exceeding Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 percentage points, respectively. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables progressively more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and enhances LLM understanding of repositories, thereby accelerating agent localization.

On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC, roughly 3.9times the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64times other baselines. It attains 81.5% functional coverage and a 69.7% pass rate, exceeding Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 percentage points, respectively. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables progressively more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and enhances LLM understanding of repositories, thereby accelerating agent localization."

A novel method for camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes using a single RGB video, incorporating patch-wise tracking filters, outlier-aware joint optimization, and a two-stage optimization strategy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter optimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and reliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes. Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised by a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1) Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics) and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as the only supervision.

Manzano is a unified multimodal LLM framework that integrates image and text processing using a hybrid tokenizer and diffusion decoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both understanding and generating visual content.  					AI-generated summary 				 Unified multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that can both understand and generate visual content hold immense potential. However, existing open-source models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models, and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.

A brain-inspired framework, Blink-Think-Link, enhances human-GUI interaction by mimicking cognitive processes and introduces innovations in data generation and reinforcement learning rewards.  					AI-generated summary 				 In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists: their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL), a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework: (1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

"A brain-inspired framework, Blink-Think-Link, enhances human-GUI interaction by mimicking cognitive processes and introduces innovations in data generation and reinforcement learning rewards.  					AI-generated summary 				 In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists: their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL), a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework: (1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents."

Lynx, a high-fidelity personalized video synthesis model, uses a Diffusion Transformer with ID-adapter and Ref-adapter to preserve identity and maintain video quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Lynx, a high-fidelity model for personalized video synthesis from a single input image. Built on an open-source Diffusion Transformer (DiT) foundation model, Lynx introduces two lightweight adapters to ensure identity fidelity. The ID-adapter employs a Perceiver Resampler to convert ArcFace-derived facial embeddings into compact identity tokens for conditioning, while the Ref-adapter integrates dense VAE features from a frozen reference pathway, injecting fine-grained details across all transformer layers through cross-attention. These modules collectively enable robust identity preservation while maintaining temporal coherence and visual realism. Through evaluation on a curated benchmark of 40 subjects and 20 unbiased prompts, which yielded 800 test cases, Lynx has demonstrated superior face resemblance, competitive prompt following, and strong video quality, thereby advancing the state of personalized video generation.

WhisTLE, a text-only adaptation method using a variational autoencoder, enhances pretrained ASR models with text-to-latent encoding and optional TTS adaptation, reducing word error rates across multiple datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models such as Whisper perform well but still need domain adaptation to handle unseen vocabulary and parlance. In many real-world settings, collecting speech data is impractical, necessitating text-only adaptation. We propose WhisTLE, a deeply supervised, text-only adaptation method for pretrained encoder-decoder ASR models. WhisTLE trains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model encoder outputs from text and fine-tunes the decoder using the learned text-to-latent encoder, optionally combined with text-to-speech (TTS) adaptation. At inference, the original encoder is restored, incurring no extra runtime cost. Across four out-of-domain datasets and four ASR models, WhisTLE with TTS reduces word error rate (WER) by 12.3% relative to TTS-only adaptation and outperforms all non-WhisTLE baselines in 27 of 32 scenarios.

VLAC, a vision-language-action reward model, enhances real-world robotic reinforcement learning by providing dense rewards and enabling one-shot transfer, significantly improving success rates and sample efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Robotic real-world reinforcement learning (RL) with vision-language-action (VLA) models is bottlenecked by sparse, handcrafted rewards and inefficient exploration. We introduce VLAC, a general process reward model built upon InternVL and trained on large scale heterogeneous datasets. Given pairwise observations and a language goal, it outputs dense progress delta and done signal, eliminating task-specific reward engineering, and supports one-shot in-context transfer to unseen tasks and environments. VLAC is trained on vision-language datasets to strengthen perception, dialogic and reasoning capabilities, together with robot and human trajectories data that ground action generation and progress estimation, and additionally strengthened to reject irrelevant prompts as well as detect regression or stagnation by constructing large numbers of negative and semantically mismatched samples. With prompt control, a single VLAC model alternately generating reward and action tokens, unifying critic and policy. Deployed inside an asynchronous real-world RL loop, we layer a graded human-in-the-loop protocol (offline demonstration replay, return and explore, human guided explore) that accelerates exploration and stabilizes early learning. Across four distinct real-world manipulation tasks, VLAC lifts success rates from about 30\% to about 90\% within 200 real-world interaction episodes; incorporating human-in-the-loop interventions yields a further 50% improvement in sample efficiency and achieves up to 100% final success.

"VLAC, a vision-language-action reward model, enhances real-world robotic reinforcement learning by providing dense rewards and enabling one-shot transfer, significantly improving success rates and sample efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Robotic real-world reinforcement learning (RL) with vision-language-action (VLA) models is bottlenecked by sparse, handcrafted rewards and inefficient exploration. We introduce VLAC, a general process reward model built upon InternVL and trained on large scale heterogeneous datasets. Given pairwise observations and a language goal, it outputs dense progress delta and done signal, eliminating task-specific reward engineering, and supports one-shot in-context transfer to unseen tasks and environments. VLAC is trained on vision-language datasets to strengthen perception, dialogic and reasoning capabilities, together with robot and human trajectories data that ground action generation and progress estimation, and additionally strengthened to reject irrelevant prompts as well as detect regression or stagnation by constructing large numbers of negative and semantically mismatched samples.

A framework incorporating dynamic role profiles with video modality enhances role-playing agents by combining adaptive temporal sampling and static role profile representations, improving response generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Role-playing agents (RPAs) have attracted growing interest for their ability to simulate immersive and interactive characters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on static role profiles, overlooking the dynamic perceptual abilities inherent to humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of dynamic role profiles by incorporating video modality into RPAs. To support this, we construct Role-playing-Video60k, a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising 60k videos and 700k corresponding dialogues. Based on this dataset, we develop a comprehensive RPA framework that combines adaptive temporal sampling with both dynamic and static role profile representations. Specifically, the dynamic profile is created by adaptively sampling video frames and feeding them to the LLM in temporal order, while the static profile consists of (1) character dialogues from training videos during fine-tuning, and (2) a summary context from the input video during inference. This joint integration enables RPAs to generate greater responses. Furthermore, we propose a robust evaluation method covering eight metrics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the importance of dynamic role profiles in developing RPAs.
