From first principle perspective, the breakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two complementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries with contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step reasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate reasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock substantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking systems. In this paper, we propose OnePiece, unified framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and ranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on pure Transformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1) structured context engineering, which augments interaction history with preference and scenario signals and unifies them into structured tokenized input sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) blockwise latent reasoning, which equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales reasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training"

SWE-BENCH PRO contains 1,865 problems sourced from diverse set of 41 actively maintained repositories spanning business applications, B2B services, and developer tools. The benchmark is partitioned into public set with open access to problems sourced from 11 repositories, held-out set of 12 repositories and commercial set of 18 proprietary repositories where we have formal partnership agreements with early-stage startups. Problems in the held-out and the commercial set are not publicly accessible, but we release results on the commercial set. Our benchmark features long-horizon tasks that may require hours to days for professional software engineer to complete, often involving patches across multiple files and substantial code modifications. All tasks are human-verified and augmented with sufficient context to ensure resolvability. In our evaluation of widely used coding models, under unified scaffold, we observe that their performance on SWE-BENCH PRO remains below 25% (Pass@1), with GPT-5 achieving the highest score to date at 23.3%. To better understand these limitations, we cluster the failure modes observed in the collected agent trajectories for clearer characterization of the error patterns exhibited by current models. Overall, SWE-BENCH PRO provides contamination-resistant testbed that more faithfully captures the complexity and diversity of real-world software development, advancing the pursuit of truly autonomous software engineering agents at professional level. 1. Introduction Large Language Model (LLM) agents have been widely adopted in modern software development workflows. SWE-bench [13] and related works [15, 2225] establish the task of issue resolution as de-facto standard for assessing their capability and usefulness. In this setting, an agent is given an entire codebase, task description (e.g., bug report or feature request) in natural language and is instructed to produce code patch that resolves the issue and passes the repositorys test suite. These benchmarks have been instrumental in demonstrating both the substantial potential and the persistent limitations of current models as SWE agents. Notably, the state-of-the-art agents have reported over 70% pass rate on SWE-Bench-Verified [15], subset of SWE-Bench that is verifiably solvable by human programmers. In the next 6 - 12 months, there will be diminishing feedback from SWE-Bench-Verified to improve coding agents. Towards this end, this paper is motivated to (1) mitigate existing issues in SWE-Bench and (2) generate high-quality coding problems for evaluating the progress of LLM agents after SWE-Bench is saturated. As result, we introduce SWE-BENCH PRO. Current coding benchmarks face several limitations. First, many benchmarks are susceptible to contamination [7, 19, 21, 26], as exemplified by recent works [5, 7, 21] and social media posts [1, 25]. This risk arises because widely 5 2 0 S 1 2 ] .

Data: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/SWE-bench_Pro Code: https://github.com/scaleapi/SWE-bench_Pro-os Figure 1: SWE-BENCH PRO is dataset with challenging, enterprise-level, long-horizon software engineering tasks. Frontier models, such as GPT-5 and Claude Opus 4.1, score less than 25% on SWE-BENCH PRO with the SWE-Agent [22] scaffold. We design the dataset with contamination resistance, difficulty filtering, and human augmentation/verification. used open-source repositoriesparticularly those distributed under permissive licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD)are prime candidates for inclusion in the large-scale web-crawled corpora used to pre-train LLMs [3]. As result, constructing benchmarks from public GitHub repositories is inherently difficult, since many are already accessible as training data. Second, existing tasks may not adequately capture the complexity of real-world software engineering. For example, SWE-Bench Verified [13] includes substantial proportion of relatively trivial problems (161 out of 500) that require only oneto two-line modifications. In contrast, industrial software engineering, particularly in enterprise settings, often demands multi-file modifications spanning hundreds of lines [9, 16]. This discrepancy raises concerns about whether current benchmarks truly reflect the challenges faced in practical development scenarios. Our first contribution in SWE-BENCH PRO is novel data collection strategy designed to mitigate data contamination. Specifically, our approach involves two complementary measures: (1) exclusively selecting repositories distributed under strong copyleft licenses (GPL) to construct public set (11 repositories) and held-out set (12 repositories), and (2) acquiring commercial codebases from real startups to capture enterprise-grade problems in commercial set (18 repositories). In doing so, we reduce contamination risks by leveraging both legal protections and restricted data access. While analogous efforts may have been undertaken in industry using proprietary codebases, to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to systematically apply such methodology for curating benchmark in the research community. The three subsets are made available under different access policies. The public set provides both problems and evaluation results openly. The held-out set remains private, preserving it for future overfitting checks against the public set. Finally, for the commercial set, we release evaluation results while keeping the underlying codebases private. The second contribution of SWE-BENCH PRO is its emphasis on challenging, diverse, and industrially relevant tasks. To ensure task complexity, we exclude trivial edits (110 lines of code) and retain only problems requiring substantial, multi-file modifications. On average, the reference solu"

[ 1 5 6 7 7 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r 2025-09-23 Qwen3-Omni Technical Report Qwen Team https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Omni https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-Demo https://modelscope.cn/studios/Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-DemoWe present Qwen3-Omni, single multimodal model that for the first time maintains state-of-the-art performance across text, image, audio, and video without any degradation relative to single-modal counterparts. Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves opensource state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe. Qwen3-Omni adopts ThinkerTalker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts. To reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms. To further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.Humans perceive visual and auditory inputs in parallel, cognitively process these signals, and emit responses through textual expression, vocalization, and tool-mediated or bodily actions, facilitating information exchange with other organisms and demonstrating intelligence. Building on the rapid advances in the understanding and reasoning capabilities of unimodal large models (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023; Gemini Team, 2024; Anthropic, 2023a;b; 2024; Bai et al., 2023a; Yang et al., 2024; 2025a; Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023b; 2025; Chu et al., 2023; 2024), natively multimodal systems have drawn substantial attention (OpenAI, 2024; Comanici et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025). Human learning typically progresses through the coordinated use of multiple modalities, where complementary specialization and cross-modal synergy improve learning efficiency. However, contemporary LLM-centric multimodal models often exhibit modality trade-offs, with gains in one modality accompanied by degradation in others. In this report, we take step toward resolving this limitation by exploring integrated multimodal training within the prevailing LLM-based paradigm. We demonstrate that joint multimodal training can achieve parity across all modalitiesi.e., no modality-specific performance degradationwhile markedly enhancing cross-modal capabilities such as video understanding. key ingredient is mixing unimodal and cross-modal data during the early stage of text pretraining. As evidenced by Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3BBase, its text and vision performance is on par with same-sized single-modal text and vision base models across extensive benchmarks, while simultaneously exhibiting strong audio competence, audiovisual understanding, cross-modal thinking, and real-time audiovisual interaction. The development of non-degrading multimodal systems is an achievable objective. Such systems are characterized by two key properties: first, their ability to match the performance of specialized unimodal models in their respective 1 Figure 1: Qwen3-Omni is unified end-to-end model capable of processing multiple modalities, such as text, audio, image and video, and generating real-time text or speech response. Based on these features, Qwen3-Omni supports wide range of tasks, including but not limited to voice dialogue, video dialogue, and video reasoning. tasks, and second, their capacity to facilitate novel cross-modal reasoning and interaction. These latter capabilities represent significant advantage, as they are not present in traditional unimodal approaches. Qwen3-Omni builds on the ThinkerTalker architecture introduced in Qwen2.5-Omni (Xu et al., 2025) and introduces five key upgrades: (1) both the Thinker and Talker are upgraded to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) designs; (2) we replace Whisper audio encoder with our AuT (Audio Transformer) encoder, trained from scratch on 20 million hours of supervised audio, yielding stronger general-purpose audio representations. AuT employs block-wise window attention to enable real-time prefill caching; (3) on the speech generation side, we adopt multi-codebook representation, whose increased capacity supports faithful modeling of diverse voices, paralinguistic cues, and acoustic phenomena; (4) the Talker shifts from single-track to multi-track codec modeling, autoregressively predicting multiple codebook layers via MTP modules, while the waveform stage (Code2Wav) replaces block-wise DiT with lightweight convolutional network (ConvNet); and (5) the input and output audio code rates are reduced to 12.5 Hz, with the output codec enabling single-frame, immediate speech synthesis. Taken together, these changes enable low-latency speech interaction under high concurrency in industrial-scale deployments. Compared with Qwen2.5-Omni, Qwen3-Omni introduces four major improvements: (1) support for audio understanding on inputs exceeding 40 minutes; (2) expanded language coverage to 119 written languages, 19 and 10 spoken languages for "

Text:"From Hugging Face to GitHub: Tracing License Drift in the Open-Source AI Ecosystem James Jewitt, Hao Li, Bram Adams, Gopi Krishnan Rajbahadur, Ahmed E. Hassan School of Computing, Queens University, Kingston, ON, Canada {james.jewitt, hao.li, bram.adams}@queensu.ca, grajbahadur@acm.org, ahmed@cs.queensu.ca 5 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 3 7 8 9 0 . 9 0 5 2 : r Abstract Hidden license conflicts in the open-source AI ecosystem pose serious legal and ethical risks, exposing organizations to potential litigation and users to undisclosed risk. However, the field lacks data-driven understanding of how frequently these conflicts occur, where they originate, and which communities are most affected. We present the first end-to-end audit of licenses for datasets and models on Hugging Face, as well as their downstream integration into open-source software applications, covering 364 thousand datasets, 1.6 million models, and 140 thousand GitHub projects. Our empirical analysis reveals systemic non-compliance in which 35.5% of model-to-application transitions eliminate restrictive license clauses by relicensing under permissive terms. In addition, we prototype an extensible rule engine that encodes almost 200 SPDX and model-specific clauses for detecting license conflicts, which can solve 86.4% of license conflicts in software applications. To support future research, we release our dataset and the prototype engine. Our study highlights license compliance as critical governance challenge in opensource AI and provides both the data and tools necessary to enable automated, AI-aware compliance at scale. Introduction The open-source AI ecosystem is navigating legal minefield, with high-stakes copyright litigation threatening the operational foundations of the industry. Recent court rulings have created volatile and uncertain landscape. On one hand, courts in cases like Bartz v. Anthropic (Bartz, Graeber, and Johnson 2024) have found AI training to be an exceedingly transformative fair use. On "

OmniInsert addresses challenges in mask-free video insertion using a novel data pipeline, feature injection, progressive training, and context-aware rephrasing, outperforming commercial solutions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in video insertion based on diffusion models are impressive. However, existing methods rely on complex control signals but struggle with subject consistency, limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we focus on the task of Mask-free Video Insertion and aim to resolve three key challenges: data scarcity, subject-scene equilibrium, and insertion harmonization. To address the data scarcity, we propose a new data pipeline InsertPipe, constructing diverse cross-pair data automatically. Building upon our data pipeline, we develop OmniInsert, a novel unified framework for mask-free video insertion from both single and multiple subject references. Specifically, to maintain subject-scene equilibrium, we introduce a simple yet effective Condition-Specific Feature Injection mechanism to distinctly inject multi-source conditions and propose a novel Progressive Training strategy that enables the model to balance feature injection from subjects and source video. Meanwhile, we design the Subject-Focused Loss to improve the detailed appearance of the subjects. To further enhance insertion harmonization, we propose an Insertive Preference Optimization methodology to optimize the model by simulating human preferences, and incorporate a Context-Aware Rephraser module during reference to seamlessly integrate the subject into the original scenes. To address the lack of a benchmark for the field, we introduce InsertBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse scenes with meticulously selected subjects. Evaluation on InsertBench indicates OmniInsert outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source commercial solutions. The code will be released.

OnePiece integrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into industrial search and recommendation systems, achieving significant improvements in key business metrics.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite the growing interest in replicating the scaled success of large language models (LLMs) in industrial search and recommender systems, most existing industrial efforts remain limited to transplanting Transformer architectures, which bring only incremental improvements over strong Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs). From a first principle perspective, the breakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two complementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries with contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step reasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate reasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock substantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking systems.   In this paper, we propose OnePiece, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and ranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on a pure Transformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1) structured context engineering, which augments interaction history with preference and scenario signals and unifies them into a structured tokenized input sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) block-wise latent reasoning, which equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales reasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training, which leverages user feedback chains to effectively supervise reasoning steps during training. OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario of Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business metrics, including over +2% GMV/UU and a +2.90% increase in advertising revenue.

"OnePiece integrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into industrial search and recommendation systems, achieving significant improvements in key business metrics.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite the growing interest in replicating the scaled success of large language models (LLMs) in industrial search and recommender systems, most existing industrial efforts remain limited to transplanting Transformer architectures, which bring only incremental improvements over strong Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs). From a first principle perspective, the breakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two complementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries with contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step reasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate reasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock substantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking systems.   In this paper, we propose OnePiece, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and ranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on a pure Transformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1) structured context engineering, which augments interaction history with preference and scenario signals and unifies them into a structured tokenized input sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) block-wise latent reasoning, which equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales reasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training, which leverages user feedback chains to effectively supervise reasoning steps during training. OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario of Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business metrics, including over +2% GMV/UU and a +2.90% increase in advertising revenue."

This paper introduces ByteWrist, a novel highly-flexible and anthropomorphic parallel wrist for robotic manipulation. ByteWrist addresses the critical limitations of existing serial and parallel wrists in narrow-space operations through a compact three-stage parallel drive mechanism integrated with arc-shaped end linkages. The design achieves precise RPY (Roll-Pitch-Yaw) motion while maintaining exceptional compactness, making it particularly suitable for complex unstructured environments such as home services, medical assistance, and precision assembly. The key innovations include: (1) a nested three-stage motor-driven linkages that minimize volume while enabling independent multi-DOF control, (2) arc-shaped end linkages that optimize force transmission and expand motion range, and (3) a central supporting ball functioning as a spherical joint that enhances structural stiffness without compromising flexibility. Meanwhile, we present comprehensive kinematic modeling including forward / inverse kinematics and a numerical Jacobian solution for precise control. Empirically, we observe ByteWrist demonstrates strong performance in narrow-space maneuverability and dual-arm cooperative manipulation tasks, outperforming Kinova-based systems. Results indicate significant improvements in compactness, efficiency, and stiffness compared to traditional designs, establishing ByteWrist as a promising solution for next-generation robotic manipulation in constrained environments.

Supervised fine-tuning of large language models can negatively impact closed-book question answering performance, with up to 90% of parameter updates not contributing to knowledge enhancement.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) acquire substantial world knowledge during pre-training, which is further shaped by post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, the impact of SFT on a model's knowledge remains underexplored, limiting our ability to control knowledge change behavior in fine-tuned models. To address this gap, we evaluate closed-book question answering (CBQA) performance across five LLMs from the LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 families. Surprisingly, models fine-tuned on 1,920 samples perform up to 14% worse than those fine-tuned on only 240 samples. Furthermore, varying the level of knowledge mastery in the fine-tuning data leads to performance fluctuations of over 12%. To investigate these effects, we analyze model behavior at both the token and parameter levels. Our analysis reveals that up to 90% of parameter updates during SFT do not contribute to knowledge enhancement. Restoring these updates can improve performance on the CBQA task, depending on the characteristics of the fine-tuning data. These insights offer practical guidance for developing fine-tuning strategies that more effectively strengthen model knowledge.

Diffusion Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT) optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching, improving efficiency and performance compared to existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been central to post-training language models, but its extension to diffusion models remains challenging due to intractable likelihoods. Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process to enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks, including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated integration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching. DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit policy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals into the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and requires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy optimization. DiffusionNFT is up to 25times more efficient than FlowGRPO in head-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO achieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging multiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of SD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested.

"Diffusion Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT) optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching, improving efficiency and performance compared to existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been central to post-training language models, but its extension to diffusion models remains challenging due to intractable likelihoods. Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process to enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks, including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated integration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching. DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit policy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals into the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and requires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy optimization. DiffusionNFT is up to 25times more efficient than FlowGRPO in head-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO achieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging multiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of SD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested."

SWE-Bench Pro is a challenging benchmark for coding models, featuring complex, enterprise-level problems that require substantial code modifications, with performance evaluations showing significant limitations in current models.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce SWE-Bench Pro, a substantially more challenging benchmark that builds upon the best practices of SWE-BENCH [25], but is explicitly designed to capture realistic, complex, enterprise-level problems beyond the scope of SWE-BENCH. SWE-BENCH PRO contains 1,865 problems sourced from a diverse set of 41 actively maintained repositories spanning business applications, B2B services, and developer tools. The benchmark is partitioned into a public set with open access to problems sourced from 11 repositories, a held-out set of 12 repositories and a commercial set of 18 proprietary repositories where we have formal partnership agreements with early-stage startups. Problems in the held-out and the commercial set are not publicly accessible, but we release results on the commercial set. Our benchmark features long-horizon tasks that may require hours to days for a professional software engineer to complete, often involving patches across multiple files and substantial code modifications. All tasks are human-verified and augmented with sufficient context to ensure resolvability. In our evaluation of widely used coding models, under a unified scaffold, we observe that their performance on SWE-Bench PRO remains below 25% (Pass@1), with GPT-5 achieving the highest score to date at 23.3%. To better understand these limitations, we cluster the failure modes observed in the collected agent trajectories for a clearer characterization of the error patterns exhibited by current models. Overall, SWE-BENCH PRO provides a contamination-resistant testbed that more faithfully captures the complexity and diversity of real-world software development, advancing the pursuit of truly autonomous software engineering agents at a professional level.

ContextFlow, a training-free framework for Diffusion Transformers, enhances video object editing by using a high-order Rectified Flow solver and Adaptive Context Enrichment to achieve precise, temporally consistent, and high-fidelity object manipulation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Training-free video object editing aims to achieve precise object-level manipulation, including object insertion, swapping, and deletion. However, it faces significant challenges in maintaining fidelity and temporal consistency. Existing methods, often designed for U-Net architectures, suffer from two primary limitations: inaccurate inversion due to first-order solvers, and contextual conflicts caused by crude "hard" feature replacement. These issues are more challenging in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), where the unsuitability of prior layer-selection heuristics makes effective guidance challenging. To address these limitations, we introduce ContextFlow, a novel training-free framework for DiT-based video object editing. In detail, we first employ a high-order Rectified Flow solver to establish a robust editing foundation. The core of our framework is Adaptive Context Enrichment (for specifying what to edit), a mechanism that addresses contextual conflicts. Instead of replacing features, it enriches the self-attention context by concatenating Key-Value pairs from parallel reconstruction and editing paths, empowering the model to dynamically fuse information. Additionally, to determine where to apply this enrichment (for specifying where to edit), we propose a systematic, data-driven analysis to identify task-specific vital layers. Based on a novel Guidance Responsiveness Metric, our method pinpoints the most influential DiT blocks for different tasks (e.g., insertion, swapping), enabling targeted and highly effective guidance. Extensive experiments show that ContextFlow significantly outperforms existing training-free methods and even surpasses several state-of-the-art training-based approaches, delivering temporally coherent, high-fidelity results.

Qwen3-Omni, a multimodal model, achieves state-of-the-art performance across text, image, audio, and video, using a Thinker-Talker MoE architecture and a lightweight causal ConvNet for efficient streaming synthesis.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Qwen3-Omni, a single multimodal model that, for the first time, maintains state-of-the-art performance across text, image, audio, and video without any degradation relative to single-modal counterparts. Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source SOTA on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe. Qwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker-Talker MoE architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages, and speech generation in 10 languages. To reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings, Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms. To further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking, and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.

EpiCache is a KV cache management framework for long conversational question answering that reduces memory usage and improves accuracy through block-wise prefill, episodic KV compression, and adaptive layer-wise budget allocation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have extended context lengths, enabling assistants to sustain long histories for coherent, personalized responses. This ability, however, hinges on Key-Value (KV) caching, whose memory grows linearly with dialogue length and quickly dominates under strict resource constraints. An active line of research for reducing this overhead is KV cache compression, which seeks to limit cache size while preserving accuracy. Yet existing methods face two major limitations: (i) evicting entries after full-context prefill causes unbounded peak memory, and (ii) query-dependent eviction narrows the cache to a single query, leading to degraded accuracy in multi-turn conversations. We introduce EpiCache, a training-free KV cache management framework for long conversational question answering (LongConvQA) under fixed memory budgets. EpiCache bounds cache growth through block-wise prefill and preserves topic-relevant context via episodic KV compression, which clusters conversation history into coherent episodes and applies episode-specific KV cache eviction. We further design an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that measures each layer's sensitivity to eviction and distributes the memory budget across layers accordingly. Across three LongConvQA benchmarks, EpiCache improves accuracy by up to 40% over recent baselines, sustains near-full KV accuracy under 4-6x compression, and reduces latency and memory by up to 2.4x and 3.5x, thereby enabling efficient multi-turn interaction under strict resource constraints.

A robust GUI agent, Mano, integrates reinforcement learning with vision-language models for high-fidelity data generation and improved performance on GUI benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are the primary medium for human-computer interaction, yet automating GUI interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of visual elements, dynamic environments, and the need for multi-step reasoning. Existing methods based on vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from limited resolution, domain mismatch, and insufficient sequential decisionmaking capability. To address these issues, we propose Mano, a robust GUI agent built upon a multi-modal foundation model pre-trained on extensive web and computer system data. Our approach integrates a novel simulated environment for high-fidelity data generation, a three-stage training pipeline (supervised fine-tuning, offline reinforcement learning, and online reinforcement learning), and a verification module for error recovery. Mano demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple GUI benchmarks, including Mind2Web and OSWorld, achieving significant improvements in success rate and operational accuracy. Our work provides new insights into the effective integration of reinforcement learning with VLMs for practical GUI agent deployment, highlighting the importance of domain-specific data, iterative training, and holistic reward design.

"A robust GUI agent, Mano, integrates reinforcement learning with vision-language models for high-fidelity data generation and improved performance on GUI benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are the primary medium for human-computer interaction, yet automating GUI interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of visual elements, dynamic environments, and the need for multi-step reasoning. Existing methods based on vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from limited resolution, domain mismatch, and insufficient sequential decisionmaking capability. To address these issues, we propose Mano, a robust GUI agent built upon a multi-modal foundation model pre-trained on extensive web and computer system data. Our approach integrates a novel simulated environment for high-fidelity data generation, a three-stage training pipeline (supervised fine-tuning, offline reinforcement learning, and online reinforcement learning), and a verification module for error recovery. Mano demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple GUI benchmarks, including Mind2Web and OSWorld, achieving significant improvements in success rate and operational accuracy. Our work provides new insights into the effective integration of reinforcement learning with VLMs for practical GUI agent deployment, highlighting the importance of domain-specific data, iterative training, and holistic reward design."

Synthetic Bootstrapped Pretraining (SBP) enhances language model performance by learning inter-document correlations and synthesizing new training data, leading to significant improvements over standard pretraining methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Synthetic Bootstrapped Pretraining (SBP), a language model (LM) pretraining procedure that first learns a model of relations between documents from the pretraining dataset and then leverages it to synthesize a vast new corpus for joint training. While the standard pretraining teaches LMs to learn causal correlations among tokens within a single document, it is not designed to efficiently model the rich, learnable inter-document correlations that can potentially lead to better performance. We validate SBP by designing a compute-matched pretraining setup and pretrain a 3B-parameter model on up to 1T tokens from scratch. We find SBP consistently improves upon a strong repetition baseline and delivers a significant fraction of performance improvement attainable by an oracle upper bound with access to 20x more unique data. Qualitative analysis reveals that the synthesized documents go beyond mere paraphrases -- SBP first abstracts a core concept from the seed material and then crafts a new narration on top of it. Besides strong empirical performance, SBP admits a natural Bayesian interpretation: the synthesizer implicitly learns to abstract the latent concepts shared between related documents.

The study audits licenses in the Hugging Face ecosystem, revealing systemic non-compliance and proposing a rule engine to detect and resolve license conflicts in open-source AI.  					AI-generated summary 				 Hidden license conflicts in the open-source AI ecosystem pose serious legal and ethical risks, exposing organizations to potential litigation and users to undisclosed risk. However, the field lacks a data-driven understanding of how frequently these conflicts occur, where they originate, and which communities are most affected. We present the first end-to-end audit of licenses for datasets and models on Hugging Face, as well as their downstream integration into open-source software applications, covering 364 thousand datasets, 1.6 million models, and 140 thousand GitHub projects. Our empirical analysis reveals systemic non-compliance in which 35.5% of model-to-application transitions eliminate restrictive license clauses by relicensing under permissive terms. In addition, we prototype an extensible rule engine that encodes almost 200 SPDX and model-specific clauses for detecting license conflicts, which can solve 86.4% of license conflicts in software applications. To support future research, we release our dataset and the prototype engine. Our study highlights license compliance as a critical governance challenge in open-source AI and provides both the data and tools necessary to enable automated, AI-aware compliance at scale.
