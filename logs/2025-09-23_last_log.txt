(4) The framework then generates high-quality video reflecting the specified style, structure, and camera motion. The synthesized video sequence shows consistent, high-quality visuals that reflect the input geometry and reference style, including challenging visual elements such as rising steam. In this paper, we propose VideoFrom3D, novel framework for synthesizing high-quality 3D scene videos from coarse geometry, camera trajectory, and reference image. Our approach streamlines the 3D graphic design workflow, enabling flexible design exploration and rapid production of deliverables. straightforward approach to synthesizing video from coarse geometry might condition video diffusion model on geometric structure. However, existing video diffusion models struggle to generate high-fidelity results for complex scenes due to the difficulty of jointly modeling visual quality, motion, and temporal consistency. To address this, we propose generative framework that leverages the complementary strengths of image and video diffusion models. Specifically, our framework consists of Sparse Anchor-view Generation (SAG) and Geometry-guided Generative Inbetweening (GGI) module. The SAG module generates high-quality, cross-view consistent anchor views using an image diffusion model, aided by Sparse Appearance-guided Sampling. Building on these anchor views, GGI module faithfully interpolates intermediate frames using video diffusion model, enhanced by flow-based camera control and structural guidance. Notably, both modules operate without any paired dataset of 3D scene models and natur"

Text:"AUDITORYBENCH++: CAN LANGUAGE MODELS UNDERSTAND AUDITORY KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT HEARING? Hyunjong Ok1,2 Suho Yoo2,3 Hyeonjun Kim1 Jaeho Lee1 1Pohang University of Science and Technology, South Korea 2HJ AILAB 3Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea 5 2 0 S 2 2 ] . [ 1 1 4 6 7 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r ABSTRACT Even without directly hearing sounds, humans can effortlessly reason about auditory properties, such as pitch, loudness, or sound-source associations, drawing on auditory commonsense. In contrast, language models often lack this capability, limiting their effectiveness in multimodal interactions. As an initial step to address this gap, we present AuditoryBench++, comprehensive benchmark for evaluating auditory knowledge and reasoning in text-only settings. The benchmark encompasses tasks that range from basic auditory comparisons to contextually grounded reasoning, enabling fine-grained analysis of how models process and integrate auditory concepts. In addition, we introduce AIRCoT, novel auditory imagination reasoning method that generates and integrates auditory information during inference through span detection with special tokens and knowledge injection. Extensive experiments with recent LLMs and Multimodal LLMs demonstrate that AIR-CoT generally outperforms both the off-the-shelf models and those augmented with auditory knowledge. The project page is available at https://auditorybenchpp.github.io. Index Terms Auditory Knowledge, Large Language Model, Reasoning Model, Benchmarks, Chain-of-Thought 1. INTRODUCTION Imagination is considered necessary ingredient of perception itself in Kantian perspectives [1, 2], as it allows us to reconstruct complete representation of the target object out of incomplete, raw sensations. For example, by reading text describing night with heavy rain and lightning, one can synthesize multimodal imagery of the scene by imagining the sounds of rain pounding like drumbeats and roaring thunder.

Text:"StereoAdapter: Adapting Stereo Depth Estimation to Underwater Scenes Zhengri Wu1 Yiran Wang2 Yu Wen1 Zeyu Zhang3 Biao Wu1 Hao Tang3 1AI Geeks 3Peking University Equal contribution. Project lead. Corresponding author: bjdxtanghao@gmail.com. 2Australian Centre for Robotics 5 2 0 S 9 1 ] . [ 1 5 1 4 6 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r Abstract Underwater stereo depth estimation provides accurate 3D geometry for robotics tasks such as navigation, inspection, and mapping, offering metric depth from lowcost passive cameras while avoiding the scale ambiguity of monocular methods. However, existing approaches face two critical challenges: (i) parameter-efficiently adapting large vision foundation encoders to the underwater domain without extensive labeled data, and (ii) tightly fusing globally coherent but scale-ambiguous monocular priors with locally metric yet photometrically fragile stereo correspondences. To address these challenges, we propose StereoAdapter, parameterefficient self-supervised framework that integrates LoRAadapted monocular foundation encoder with recurrent stereo refinement module. We further introduce dynamic LoRA adaptation for efficient rank selection and pre-training on the synthetic UW-StereoDepth-40K dataset to enhance robustness under diverse underwater conditions. Comprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show improvements of 6.11% on TartanAir and 5.12% on SQUID compared to state-of-the-art methods, while real-world deployment with the BlueROV2 robot further demonstrates the consistent robustness of our approach.

INTRODUCTION Stereo depth estimation is pervasive in robotics for understanding [1], [2], [3], navigation [4], manipulation [5], and inspection [6], offering metric 3D from low-cost passive binocular cameras and avoiding the scale ambiguity that plagues monocular depth [7], [8].

Text:"5 2 0 2 2 2 ] . [ 1 5 9 0 8 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r MetaEmbed: Scaling Multimodal Retrieval at Test-Time with Flexible Late Interaction Zilin Xiao1,2,, Qi Ma1, Mengting Gu1, Jason Chen1, Xintao Chen1, Vicente Ordonez2, Vijai Mohan1 1Meta Superintelligence Labs, 2Rice University Work done at Meta Universal multimodal embedding models have achieved great success in capturing semantic relevance between queries and candidates. However, current methods either condense queries and candidates into single vector, potentially limiting the expressiveness for fine-grained information, or produce too many vectors that are prohibitively expensive for multi-vector retrieval. In this work, we introduce MetaEmbed, new framework for multimodal retrieval that rethinks how multimodal embeddings are constructed and interacted with at scale. During training, fixed number of learnable Meta Tokens are appended to the input sequence. At test-time, their last-layer contextualized representations serve as compact yet expressive multi-vector embeddings. Through the proposed Matryoshka MultiVector Retrieval training, MetaEmbed learns to organize information by granularity across multiple vectors. As result, we enable test-time scaling in multimodal retrieval where users can balance retrieval quality against efficiency demands by selecting the number of tokens used for indexing and retrieval interactions. Extensive evaluations on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB) and the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark (ViDoRe) confirm that MetaEmbed achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while scaling robustly to models with 32B parameters.

LIMI demonstrates that sophisticated agentic intelligence can emerge from minimal, strategically curated demonstrations, outperforming data-intensive models on agency benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 We define Agency as the emergent capacity of AI systems to function as autonomous agents actively discovering problems, formulating hypotheses, and executing solutions through self-directed engagement with environments and tools. This fundamental capability marks the dawn of the Age of AI Agency, driven by a critical industry shift: the urgent need for AI systems that don't just think, but work. While current AI excels at reasoning and generating responses, industries demand autonomous agents that can execute tasks, operate tools, and drive real-world outcomes. As agentic intelligence becomes the defining characteristic separating cognitive systems from productive workers, efficiently cultivating machine autonomy becomes paramount. Current approaches assume that more data yields better agency, following traditional scaling laws from language modeling. We fundamentally challenge this paradigm. LIMI (Less Is More for Intelligent Agency) demonstrates that agency follows radically different development principles. Through strategic focus on collaborative software development and scientific research workflows, we show that sophisticated agentic intelligence can emerge from minimal but strategically curated demonstrations of autonomous behavior. Using only 78 carefully designed training samples, LIMI achieves 73.5% on comprehensive agency benchmarks, dramatically outperforming state-of-the-art models: Kimi-K2-Instruct (24.1%), DeepSeek-V3.1 (11.9%), Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct (27.5%), and GLM-4.5 (45.1%). Most strikingly, LIMI demonstrates 53.7% improvement over models trained on 10,000 samples-achieving superior agentic intelligence with 128 times fewer samples. Our findings establish the Agency Efficiency Principle: machine autonomy emerges not from data abundance but from strategic curation of high-quality agentic demonstrations.

VideoFrom3D synthesizes high-quality 3D scene videos using a combination of image and video diffusion models, achieving style consistency without requiring paired datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we propose VideoFrom3D, a novel framework for synthesizing high-quality 3D scene videos from coarse geometry, a camera trajectory, and a reference image. Our approach streamlines the 3D graphic design workflow, enabling flexible design exploration and rapid production of deliverables. A straightforward approach to synthesizing a video from coarse geometry might condition a video diffusion model on geometric structure. However, existing video diffusion models struggle to generate high-fidelity results for complex scenes due to the difficulty of jointly modeling visual quality, motion, and temporal consistency. To address this, we propose a generative framework that leverages the complementary strengths of image and video diffusion models. Specifically, our framework consists of a Sparse Anchor-view Generation (SAG) and a Geometry-guided Generative Inbetweening (GGI) module. The SAG module generates high-quality, cross-view consistent anchor views using an image diffusion model, aided by Sparse Appearance-guided Sampling. Building on these anchor views, GGI module faithfully interpolates intermediate frames using a video diffusion model, enhanced by flow-based camera control and structural guidance. Notably, both modules operate without any paired dataset of 3D scene models and natural images, which is extremely difficult to obtain. Comprehensive experiments show that our method produces high-quality, style-consistent scene videos under diverse and challenging scenarios, outperforming simple and extended baselines.

AuditoryBench++ and AIR-CoT enhance text-only models' auditory reasoning and knowledge integration, outperforming existing models in multimodal interactions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Even without directly hearing sounds, humans can effortlessly reason about auditory properties, such as pitch, loudness, or sound-source associations, drawing on auditory commonsense. In contrast, language models often lack this capability, limiting their effectiveness in multimodal interactions. As an initial step to address this gap, we present AuditoryBench++, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating auditory knowledge and reasoning in text-only settings. The benchmark encompasses tasks that range from basic auditory comparisons to contextually grounded reasoning, enabling fine-grained analysis of how models process and integrate auditory concepts. In addition, we introduce AIR-CoT, a novel auditory imagination reasoning method that generates and integrates auditory information during inference through span detection with special tokens and knowledge injection. Extensive experiments with recent LLMs and Multimodal LLMs demonstrate that AIR-CoT generally outperforms both the off-the-shelf models and those augmented with auditory knowledge.

"AuditoryBench++ and AIR-CoT enhance text-only models' auditory reasoning and knowledge integration, outperforming existing models in multimodal interactions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Even without directly hearing sounds, humans can effortlessly reason about auditory properties, such as pitch, loudness, or sound-source associations, drawing on auditory commonsense. In contrast, language models often lack this capability, limiting their effectiveness in multimodal interactions. As an initial step to address this gap, we present AuditoryBench++, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating auditory knowledge and reasoning in text-only settings. The benchmark encompasses tasks that range from basic auditory comparisons to contextually grounded reasoning, enabling fine-grained analysis of how models process and integrate auditory concepts. In addition, we introduce AIR-CoT, a novel auditory imagination reasoning method that generates and integrates auditory information during inference through span detection with special tokens and knowledge injection. Extensive experiments with recent LLMs and Multimodal LLMs demonstrate that AIR-CoT generally outperforms both the off-the-shelf models and those augmented with auditory knowledge.

The Model Parity Aligner (MPA) framework improves Small Vision-Language Models (S-VLMs) by leveraging unlabeled images and knowledge transfer from Large Vision-Language Models (L-VLMs) to reduce performance gaps in vision and language tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Vision-Language Models (L-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various vision and language tasks, including visual question answering (VQA). However, their high computational cost makes them impractical for resource-constrained settings and inference-heavy applications. In contrast, Small Vision-Language Models (S-VLMs) offer efficiency but suffer from a significant performance gap compared to their larger counterparts. In this work, we introduce the Model Parity Aligner (MPA), a novel framework designed to systematically improve S-VLMs by leveraging unlabeled images and effective knowledge transfer from L-VLMs. Instead of traditional knowledge distillation methods that rely on labeled training data, MPA employs a strategic parity-based approach that precisely identifies the knowledge disparities between S-VLMs and L-VLMs, and optimizes training by targeting only these disparities. We conduct extensive experiments on four diverse VQA benchmarks, namely TextVQA, ST-VQA, ChartQA, and OKVQA, each of which requires specialized reasoning capabilities such as text recognition, chart interpretation, and commonsense and factual understanding. Our results demonstrate that MPA consistently enhances the performance of S-VLMs on all benchmarks, reducing the performance gap while maintaining computational efficiency. We make our code publicly available.

StereoAdapter is a parameter-efficient self-supervised framework that integrates a LoRA-adapted monocular encoder with a recurrent stereo refinement module for underwater stereo depth estimation, improving accuracy and robustness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Underwater stereo depth estimation provides accurate 3D geometry for robotics tasks such as navigation, inspection, and mapping, offering metric depth from low-cost passive cameras while avoiding the scale ambiguity of monocular methods. However, existing approaches face two critical challenges: (i) parameter-efficiently adapting large vision foundation encoders to the underwater domain without extensive labeled data, and (ii) tightly fusing globally coherent but scale-ambiguous monocular priors with locally metric yet photometrically fragile stereo correspondences. To address these challenges, we propose StereoAdapter, a parameter-efficient self-supervised framework that integrates a LoRA-adapted monocular foundation encoder with a recurrent stereo refinement module. We further introduce dynamic LoRA adaptation for efficient rank selection and pre-training on the synthetic UW-StereoDepth-40K dataset to enhance robustness under diverse underwater conditions. Comprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show improvements of 6.11% on TartanAir and 5.12% on SQUID compared to state-of-the-art methods, while real-world deployment with the BlueROV2 robot further demonstrates the consistent robustness of our approach.

MetaEmbed, a new framework for multimodal retrieval, uses learnable Meta Tokens to provide compact yet expressive multi-vector embeddings, enabling scalable and efficient retrieval performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Universal multimodal embedding models have achieved great success in capturing semantic relevance between queries and candidates. However, current methods either condense queries and candidates into a single vector, potentially limiting the expressiveness for fine-grained information, or produce too many vectors that are prohibitively expensive for multi-vector retrieval. In this work, we introduce MetaEmbed, a new framework for multimodal retrieval that rethinks how multimodal embeddings are constructed and interacted with at scale. During training, a fixed number of learnable Meta Tokens are appended to the input sequence. At test-time, their last-layer contextualized representations serve as compact yet expressive multi-vector embeddings. Through the proposed Matryoshka Multi-Vector Retrieval training, MetaEmbed learns to organize information by granularity across multiple vectors. As a result, we enable test-time scaling in multimodal retrieval, where users can balance retrieval quality against efficiency demands by selecting the number of tokens used for indexing and retrieval interactions. Extensive evaluations on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB) and the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark (ViDoRe) confirm that MetaEmbed achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while scaling robustly to models with 32B parameters.

At test-time, their last-layer contextualized representations serve as compact yet expressive multi-vector embeddings. Through the proposed Matryoshka Multi-Vector Retrieval training, MetaEmbed learns to organize information by granularity across multiple vectors. As a result, we enable test-time scaling in multimodal retrieval, where users can balance retrieval quality against efficiency demands by selecting the number of tokens used for indexing and retrieval interactions. Extensive evaluations on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB) and the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark (ViDoRe) confirm that MetaEmbed achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while scaling robustly to models with 32B parameters."

"MetaEmbed, a new framework for multimodal retrieval, uses learnable Meta Tokens to provide compact yet expressive multi-vector embeddings, enabling scalable and efficient retrieval performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Universal multimodal embedding models have achieved great success in capturing semantic relevance between queries and candidates. However, current methods either condense queries and candidates into a single vector, potentially limiting the expressiveness for fine-grained information, or produce too many vectors that are prohibitively expensive for multi-vector retrieval. In this work, we introduce MetaEmbed, a new framework for multimodal retrieval that rethinks how multimodal embeddings are constructed and interacted with at scale. During training, a fixed number of learnable Meta Tokens are appended to the input sequence. At test-time, their last-layer contextualized representations serve as compact yet expressive multi-vector embeddings. Through the proposed Matryoshka Multi-Vector Retrieval training, MetaEmbed learns to organize information by granularity across multiple vectors. As a result, we enable test-time scaling in multimodal retrieval, where users can balance retrieval quality against efficiency demands by selecting the number of tokens used for indexing and retrieval interactions. Extensive evaluations on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB) and the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark (ViDoRe) confirm that MetaEmbed achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while scaling robustly to models with 32B parameters."
