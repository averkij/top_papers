A new dataset for Indian culture is introduced to evaluate the cultural competence of large language models, focusing on sub-regional cultural facets and providing a framework for human and model-based evaluations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in various tasks and applications. However, despite their wide capabilities, they are shown to lack cultural alignment ryan-etal-2024-unintended, alkhamissi-etal-2024-investigating and produce biased generations naous-etal-2024-beer due to a lack of cultural knowledge and competence. Evaluation of LLMs for cultural awareness and alignment is particularly challenging due to the lack of proper evaluation metrics and unavailability of culturally grounded datasets representing the vast complexity of cultures at the regional and sub-regional levels. Existing datasets for culture specific items (CSIs) focus primarily on concepts at the regional level and may contain false positives. To address this issue, we introduce a novel CSI dataset for Indian culture, belonging to 17 cultural facets. The dataset comprises sim8k cultural concepts from 36 sub-regions. To measure the cultural competence of LLMs on a cultural text adaptation task, we evaluate the adaptations using the CSIs created, LLM as Judge, and human evaluations from diverse socio-demographic region. Furthermore, we perform quantitative analysis demonstrating selective sub-regional coverage and surface-level adaptations across all considered LLMs. Our dataset is available here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nlip/DIWALI{https://huggingface.co/datasets/nlip/DIWALI}, project webpage\href{https://nlip-lab.github.io/nlip/publications/diwali/{https://nlip-lab.github.io/nlip/publications/diwali/}}, and our codebase with model outputs can be found here: https://github.com/pramitsahoo/culture-evaluation{https://github.com/pramitsahoo/culture-evaluation}.
