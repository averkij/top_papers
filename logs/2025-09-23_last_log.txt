Text:"5 2 0 2 2 2 ] . [ 1 4 8 0 8 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r ByteWrist: Parallel Robotic Wrist Enabling Flexible and Anthropomorphic Motion for Confined Spaces Jiawen Tian, Liqun Huang, Zhongren Cui, Jingchao Qiao, Jiafeng Xu, Xiao Ma, Zeyu RenCorresponding authorsThis paper introduces ByteWrist, novel highly-flexible and anthropomorphic parallel wrist for robotic manipulation. ByteWrist addresses the critical limitations of existing serial and parallel wrists in narrow-space operations through compact three-stage parallel drive mechanism integrated with arc-shaped end linkages. The design achieves precise RPY (Roll-Pitch-Yaw) motion while maintaining exceptional compactness, making it particularly suitable for complex unstructured environments such as home services, medical assistance, and precision assembly. The key innovations include: (1) nested three-stage motor-driven linkages that minimize volume while enabling independent multi-DOF control, (2) arc-shaped end linkages that optimize force transmission and expand motion range, and (3) central supporting ball functioning as spherical joint that enhances structural stiffness without compromising flexibility. Meanwhile, we present comprehensive kinematic modeling including forward / inverse kinematics and numerical Jacobian solution for precise control. Empirically, we observe ByteWrist demonstrates strong performance in narrow-space maneuverability and dual-arm cooperative manipulation tasks, outperforming Kinova-based systems. Results indicate significant improvements in compactness, efficiency, and stiffness compared to traditional designs, establishing ByteWrist as promising solution for next-generation robotic manipulation in constrained environments. Date: September 23, 2025 Correspondence: tianjiawen.robot@bytedance.com,renzeyu.93@bytedance.com Project Page: https://bytewrist.github.io/With the rapid advancement of robotic technology, robot application scenarios have shifted dramatically from open and highly structured environments to complex and unstructured settings such as home services, medical assistance, and precision assembly [1, 2]. Among these scenarios, operations in narrow and confined spaces, such as handling objects in cluttered home cabinets, performing minimally invasive surgical interventions in human body cavities, and assembling precision components in automotive engine compartments have put forward increasingly stringent requirements for the flexibility, compactness, and dynamic responsiveness of robotic end-effectors, especially robotic wrists. Traditional serial robotic wrists, composed of multiple sequentially connected rotational joints, have the advantages of straightforward kinematic modeling [3, 4] and large rotational range per joint [5, 6]. However, 1 (a) Components Description in Wireframe. (b) Parameters Description in Prototype. Figure 1 Design and Development of ByteWrist. their open-chain structure leads to accumulated errors, low structural stiffness, and relatively bulky overall volume. When operating in narrow spaces, the multi-link serial structure is prone to collision with the surrounding environment, limiting their maneuverability. In contrast, parallel robotic wrists, which actuate the end platform through multiple parallel branches, demonstrate higher structural rigidity, superior load capacity, and better motion accuracy. However, existing parallel wrist configurations with different structural designs and actuation methods struggle to simultaneously meet the requirements of compactness and flexibility [7], as well as those of high rigidity, high load capacity and simple transmission mode [812]. This renders them less suitable for anthropomorphic manipulation tasks that necessitate both high dexterity and strong spatial adaptability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes novel parallel robotic wrist named ByteWrist. The core design concept of ByteWrist is to integrate compact three-stage parallel drive mechanism with arc-shaped end linkages, achieving precise RPY motion [1316] of the end platform while maintaining small structural footprint. Compared with existing parallel and serial wrists, ByteWrist features three key innovations: 1. High Compactness: The nested three-stage motor-driven linkages that minimize the overall volume while enabling independent control of multiple degrees of freedom. 2. High Efficiency: The arc-shaped end linkages optimize the force transmission path and expand the effective motion range of the end platform. 3. High Stiffness: The central supporting ball functioned as spherical joint enhances structural stiffness without sacrificing flexibility. This paper is organized as follows: Section II elaborates on the mechanical structure of ByteWrist, encompassing its drive mechanism, linkage design, and key structural parameters. Section III establishes the forward and inverse kinematic models for the wrist, and proposes numerical solution for the Jacobian matrix to ensure precise control. Section IV validates the performance of ByteWrist through three sets of experiments: motion range testing, narrow-space maneuverability comparison with Kinova, and dual-arm chest-front cooperative manipulation for clothes hanging. Finally, Section summarizes the research findings and discusses prospective improvements.ByteWrist is illustrated in Fig. 1a, which is driven by three stage motors. The output of the first-stage motor is connected to the first-stage driving linkage, which is further linked to the parallel platform via an arc-shaped end linkage. Meanwhile, the second-stage motor is mounted inside the first-stage driving linkage, its output connects to the second-stage driving linkage, which is also linked to the parallel platform through an arc-shaped end linkage. Similarly, the third-stage motor is fixed within the second-stage driving linkage, with its output attached to the third-stage driving linkage that connects to the parallel platform via an arc-shaped end linkage. 2 All three stage driving linkages and arc-shaped end linkages, as well as arc-shaped end linkages and parallel platform, are connected via revolute pairs. All these six revolute pairs are oriented toward the center of the parallel platform. To enhance the stiffness of the parallel platform, supporting ball is mounted at its center and connected to the platform via spherical joint. By controlling the movement of three stage motors, the end parallel platform can achieve precise RPY motion. As illu"

Text:"ARE: scaling up agent environments and evaluations Meta Superintelligence Labs1 1A detailed contributor list can be found in the appendix of this paper. We introduce Meta Agents Research Environments (ARE), research platform for scalable creation of environments, integration of synthetic or real applications, and execution of agentic orchestrations. ARE provides simple abstractions to build complex and diverse environments, each with their own rules, tools, content, and verifiers, helping to bridge the gap between model development and real-world deployment. We also propose Gaia2, benchmark built in ARE and designed to measure general agent capabilities. Beyond search and execution, Gaia2 requires agents to handle ambiguities and noise, adapt to dynamic environments, collaborate with other agents, and operate under temporal constraints. Unlike prior benchmarks, Gaia2 runs asynchronously, surfacing new failure modes that are invisible in static settings. Our experiments show that no system dominates across the intelligence spectrum: stronger reasoning often comes at the cost of efficiency, and budget scaling curves plateau, highlighting the need for new architectures and adaptive compute strategies. Perhaps more importantly, ARE abstractions enable continuous extension of Gaia2 to other environments, empowering the community to rapidly create new benchmarks tailored to their domains. In AIs second half, progress increasingly depends on defining meaningful tasks and robust evaluations to drive frontier capabilities forward.

ARE provides simple abstractions to build complex and diverse environments, each with their own rules, tools, content, and verifiers, helping to bridge the gap between model development and real-world deployment. We also propose Gaia2, a benchmark built in ARE and designed to measure general agent capabilities. Beyond search and execution, Gaia2 requires agents to handle ambiguities and noise, adapt to dynamic environments, collaborate with other agents, and operate under temporal constraints. Unlike prior benchmarks, Gaia2 runs asynchronously, surfacing new failure modes that are invisible in static settings. Our experiments show that no system dominates across the intelligence spectrum: stronger reasoning often comes at the cost of efficiency, and budget scaling curves plateau, highlighting the need for new architectures and adaptive compute strategies. Perhaps more importantly, ARE abstractions enable continuous extension of Gaia2 to other environments, empowering the community to rapidly create new benchmarks tailored to their domains. In AI's second half, progress increasingly depends on defining meaningful tasks and robust evaluations to drive frontier capabilities forward.

На базе ARE разработан бенчмарк Gaia2, оценивающий общие возможности агентов в динамических асинхронных условиях. Gaia2 требует от агентов адаптации к изменяющейся среде, сотрудничества и работы в условиях временных ограничений. Эксперименты показали, что ни одна система не доминирует во всем спектре задач, что указывает на необходимость разработки новых архитектур ИИ.",
