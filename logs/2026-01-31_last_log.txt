INTRODUCTION Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) establish direct communication pathway between neural activities and external devices by decoding various brain signals [63]. They can be diagnostic and therapeutic tools for wide range of neurological and psychiatric diseases, e.g., epilepsy [85], disorder of consciousness [86], and mood disorders [84], and can support communications and interactions for individuals with severe motor or speech impairments [64] caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, high level spinal cord injury, etc. D.

This paper focuses on non-invasive BCIs, which do not require implanting sensors inside the brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG), collected by electrodes placed on the scalp of the subject, is the most widely used input in non-invasive BCIs [65]. Classical EEG-based BCI paradigms include motor imagery (MI), steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP), event related potentials (ERP), epilepsy recognition, and so on. Recent years have witnessed some emerging paradigms that target higher level cognitive states, such as mental workload [66] and imagined speech [67], [87]. Together, these developments underscore the potential of EEG as versatile interface to cognitive and neural processes. Deep learning has driven substantial progress in EEG decoding over the past decade. Convolutional neural networks [57], recurrent neural networks [89], and more recently Transformer-based architectures [88], have been adapted to model the complex spatiotemporal structure of multichannel EEG signals. These methods often outperform classical pipelines that rely on handcrafted features. Despite these advances, real-world deployment of deep learning models remains challenging. First, most approaches require large amounts of labeled data, whereas EEG acquisition and expert annotation are costly and time consuming. Second, EEG devices differ widely in channel counts and electrode layouts, and conventional architectures often fail to accommodate heterogeneous inputs [68], [90]. Third, many existing models are trained for single task with limited capacity and limited transferability, which restricts their generalization to new BCI paradigms. Built on recent progresses on large language models [69] and vision foundation models [70], EEG foundation models [71], as illustrated in Fig. 1, have emerged as promising direction for addressing these challenges. The core premise is that model pre-trained on large-scale heterogeneous EEG data can learn general-purpose representations that transfer effectively to diverse downstream tasks with minimal taskspeciﬁc adaptation. This paradigm offers principled solution to the data scarcity problem, as self-supervised pre-training can leverage vast amounts of unlabeled recordings that would otherwise remain unutilized. Furthermore, foundation models can be designed to accommodate diverse electrode conﬁgurations, enabling single pre-trained model to generalize across heterogeneous devices. Numerous EEG foundation models were proposed in the past two years, with diverse pre-training objectives, architecTHINGS NIMH Heterogeneous EEG Signals BCI Foundation Models Various Paradigms Fig. 1: Overview of BCI foundation models.

Some models focus on generalpurpose representation learning across multiple paradigms, whereas others on speciﬁc clinical or cognitive applications. Pre-training strategies range from masked signal reconstruction and contrastive learning to codebook-based discrete modeling and autoregressive sequence prediction. Architecturally, these m"

EEG foundation models show mixed performance compared to specialist models, with larger models not always providing better generalization under current data regimes.  					AI-generated summary 				 Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), aiming to learn transferable neural representations from large-scale heterogeneous recordings. Despite rapid progresses, there lacks fair and comprehensive comparisons of existing EEG foundation models, due to inconsistent pre-training objectives, preprocessing choices, and downstream evaluation protocols. This paper fills this gap. We first review 50 representative models and organize their design choices into a unified taxonomic framework including data standardization, model architectures, and self-supervised pre-training strategies. We then evaluate 12 open-source foundation models and competitive specialist baselines across 13 EEG datasets spanning nine BCI paradigms. Emphasizing real-world deployments, we consider both cross-subject generalization under a leave-one-subject-out protocol and rapid calibration under a within-subject few-shot setting. We further compare full-parameter fine-tuning with linear probing to assess the transferability of pre-trained representations, and examine the relationship between model scale and downstream performance. Our results indicate that: 1) linear probing is frequently insufficient; 2) specialist models trained from scratch remain competitive across many tasks; and, 3) larger foundation models do not necessarily yield better generalization performance under current data regimes and training practices.
