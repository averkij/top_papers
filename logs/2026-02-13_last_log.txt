Recent studies focus on better exploiting limited training data by prioritizing hard prompts whose rollout pass rate is 0. However, easy prompts with pass rate of 1 also become increasingly prevalent as training progresses, thereby reducing the effective data size. To mitigate this, we propose Composition-RL, simple yet useful approach for better utilizing limited verifiable prompts targeting pass-rate-1 prompts. More specifically, Composition-RL automatically composes multiple problems into new verifiable question and uses these compositional prompts for RL training. Extensive experiments across model sizes from 4B to 30B show that CompositionRL consistently improves reasoning capability over RL trained on the original dataset. Performance can be further boosted with curriculum variant of Composition-RL that gradually increases compositional depth over training. Additionally, Composition-RL enables more effective cross-domain RL by composing prompts drawn from different domains.

Introduction After the advent of OpenAI-o1 (Jaech et al., 2024) and DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025), Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has reshaped the training lifecycle of large language models (LLMs), improv1HY, Tencent 2The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 3The University of Hong Kong. Correspondence to: Can Yang <macyang@ust.hk>, Saiyong Yang <stevesyang@tencent.com>. Preprint. February 13, 2026. 1 ing both text-only reasoning (Luo et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025a; Liu et al., 2025b; Cai et al., 2025) and multimodal question answering (Meng et al., 2025; Xiao et al., 2025). Rapid progress in RLVR, including improved optimization algorithms (Nan et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025a; Liu et al., 2025b), more efficient training frameworks (Sheng et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025b), and techniques to mitigate traininginference mismatch (Yao et al., 2025; Qi et al., 2025), has contributed to the strong slow-thinking ability of large reasoning models (LRMs), often manifested as longer chain of thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022). At its core, RLVR relies on large collections of training prompts paired with ground-truth answers to enable verifiable reward computation during training (Hu et al., 2025; He et al., 2025b; Luo et al., 2025). Prompts with 0/1 rollout accuracy yield zero gradient signals in RLVR algorithms (Yu et al., 2025), substantially reducing the number of available informative prompts during training. However, collecting and cleaning additional high-quality training prompts is often expensive (He et al., 2025b; Zeng et al., 2025). To mitigate this, prior work has primarily focused on better leveraging hard prompts with zero success rate, via advantage shaping (Le et al., 2025; Nan et al., 2025), allocating more rollouts (Yang et al., 2025c; Li et al., 2025c), and hint-based augmentation (Chen et al., 2025b; Li et al., 2025a). Nevertheless, while all-zero prompts constitute some fraction of the training set, as training progresses, an increasing proportion of prompts attain rollout accuracy of 1. This motivates the need for methods that can better exploit these easy prompts. In this work, we propose Composition-RL, simple yet effective approach for better utilizing limited verifiable training prompts by transforming simple prompts into more challenging ones. We first introduce procedure for composing existing prompts into new prompts (Section 3.1) and empirically show that prompt composition can, to some extent, mitigate the growing number of too-easy prompts (Section 3.2). We then formalize Composition-RL as RL training on compositional prompts (Section 3.3); an overview is provided in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, CompositionRL outperforms RL training on the original prompts, with Composition-RL: Compose Your Verifiable Prompts for Reinforcement Learning of Large Language Models Figure 1. Overview of Composition-RL. Top: an example of composing two math problems, illustrating the high-level idea of CompositionRL. Bottom left: pass@1 (%) on AIME24 versus training steps for different methods, summarizing key findings in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. Bottom right: cross-topic results on MMLU-Pro subjects with the top-5 largest sample sizes, highlighting the main finding in Section 4.4. increasing performance gains when combined with curriculum over compositional depth K. Moreover, composing prompts from different domains shows strong potential for cross-domain RL training. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: ❶ We propose Composition-RL, an approach that performs RL on composed prompts that are automatically transformed from existing ones. ❷ Extensive experiments on 4B-30B LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of Composition-RL and the curriculum variant of Composition-RL. ❸ We show that RL on composed prompts spanning physics and math is more effective than simply mixing training problems, regardless of whether sequential or joint training. ❹ We analyze the reasons behind the success of Composition-RL through the lenses of compositional generalization and implicit process supervision. 2. Preliminary Notation. We denote an LLM parameterized by θ as policy πθ. Let be an input query (i.e., prompt) and be the set of all queries. Given response = (r1, . . . , rr) to q, the policy likelihood can be written as πθ(r q) = (cid:81)r t=1 πθ(rt q, r<t), where r<t = (r1, . . . , rt1) and is the number of tokens in r. Each (q, r) can be evaluated by verifier v(q, r) {0, 1}, which indicates whether matches the ground-truth answer of (denoted as gt). RLVR.

Bottom: Technical philosophy and performance. Distributional inconsistencies are inherent to robot learning (Ptrain: expert demonstrations; Qmodel: policy inductive bias; Ptest: deployment trajectories). χ0 systematically resolves these pairwise mismatches: Model Arithmetic aligns Qmodel with Ptrain; Train-Deploy Alignment bridges Ptrain and Ptest; and Stage Advantage optimizes Qmodel for Ptest. The contributions of these modules collectively enable χ0 to surpass the baseline π0.5 [3] in terms of success rate by approximately 250%. AbstractHigh-reliability long-horizon robotic manipulation has traditionally relied on large-scale data and compute to understand complex real-world dynamics. However, we identify that the primary bottleneck to real-world robustness is not resource scale alone, but the distributional shift among the human demonstration distribution, the inductive bias learned by the policy, and the test-time execution distributiona systematic inconsistency that causes compounding errors in multi-stage tasks. To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose χ0, resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation.

[ 1 5 7 0 1 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Fig. 1: We present RISE, framework for Reinforcement learning via Imagination for SElf-improving robots. (a) Conventional physical-world RL is bottlenecked by hardware cost, slow serial interaction, and the need for manual reset. (b) RISE shifts the learning environment to Compositional World Model, which first emulates future observations for proposed actions, then evaluates imagined states to derive advantage for policy improvement. (c) Training on massive imaginative rollouts effectively bootstraps RISEs performance across variety of complex, contact-rich tasks, surpassing prior art by non-trivial margin. AbstractDespite the sustained scaling on model capacity and data acquisition, VisionLanguageAction (VLA) models remain brittle in contact-rich and dynamic manipulation tasks, where minor execution deviations can compound into failures. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers principled path to robustness, on-policy RL in the physical world is constrained by safety risk, hardware cost, and environment reset. To bridge this gap, we present RISE, scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. Th"

Composition-RL improves reasoning capabilities by automatically composing multiple problems into new verifiable questions for reinforcement learning training.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large-scale verifiable prompts underpin the success of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but they contain many uninformative examples and are costly to expand further. Recent studies focus on better exploiting limited training data by prioritizing hard prompts whose rollout pass rate is 0. However, easy prompts with a pass rate of 1 also become increasingly prevalent as training progresses, thereby reducing the effective data size. To mitigate this, we propose Composition-RL, a simple yet useful approach for better utilizing limited verifiable prompts targeting pass-rate-1 prompts. More specifically, Composition-RL automatically composes multiple problems into a new verifiable question and uses these compositional prompts for RL training. Extensive experiments across model sizes from 4B to 30B show that Composition-RL consistently improves reasoning capability over RL trained on the original dataset. Performance can be further boosted with a curriculum variant of Composition-RL that gradually increases compositional depth over training. Additionally, Composition-RL enables more effective cross-domain RL by composing prompts drawn from different domains.

A resource-efficient robotic manipulation framework addresses distributional shifts through model arithmetic, stage-aware advantage estimation, and train-deploy alignment to achieve long-horizon task reliability.  					AI-generated summary 				 High-reliability long-horizon robotic manipulation has traditionally relied on large-scale data and compute to understand complex real-world dynamics. However, we identify that the primary bottleneck to real-world robustness is not resource scale alone, but the distributional shift among the human demonstration distribution, the inductive bias learned by the policy, and the test-time execution distribution -- a systematic inconsistency that causes compounding errors in multi-stage tasks. To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose χ_{0}, a resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation. Our approach builds off three technical pillars: (i) Model Arithmetic, a weight-space merging strategy that efficiently soaks up diverse distributions of different demonstrations, varying from object appearance to state variations; (ii) Stage Advantage, a stage-aware advantage estimator that provides stable, dense progress signals, overcoming the numerical instability of prior non-stage approaches; and (iii) Train-Deploy Alignment, which bridges the distribution gap via spatio-temporal augmentation, heuristic DAgger corrections, and temporal chunk-wise smoothing. χ_{0} enables two sets of dual-arm robots to collaboratively orchestrate long-horizon garment manipulation, spanning tasks from flattening, folding, to hanging different clothes. Our method exhibits high-reliability autonomy; we are able to run the system from arbitrary initial state for consecutive 24 hours non-stop. Experiments validate that χ_{0} surpasses the state-of-the-art π_{0.5} in success rate by nearly 250%, with only 20-hour data and 8 A100 GPUs. Code, data and models will be released to facilitate the community.

A new benchmark dataset called ExStrucTiny is introduced for structured information extraction from document images, addressing limitations of existing datasets and evaluating vision-language models on diverse document types and flexible schemas.  					AI-generated summary 				 Enterprise documents, such as forms and reports, embed critical information for downstream applications like data archiving, automated workflows, and analytics. Although generalist Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform well on established document understanding benchmarks, their ability to conduct holistic, fine-grained structured extraction across diverse document types and flexible schemas is not well studied. Existing Key Entity Extraction (KEE), Relation Extraction (RE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets are limited by narrow entity ontologies, simple queries, or homogeneous document types, often overlooking the need for adaptable and structured extraction. To address these gaps, we introduce ExStrucTiny, a new benchmark dataset for structured Information Extraction (IE) from document images, unifying aspects of KEE, RE, and VQA. Built through a novel pipeline combining manual and synthetic human-validated samples, ExStrucTiny covers more varied document types and extraction scenarios. We analyze open and closed VLMs on this benchmark, highlighting challenges such as schema adaptation, query under-specification, and answer localization. We hope our work provides a bedrock for improving generalist models for structured IE in documents.

RISE is a robotic reinforcement learning framework that uses a compositional world model to predict multi-view futures and evaluate imagined outcomes, enabling policy improvement through virtual interactions rather than physical trials.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite the sustained scaling on model capacity and data acquisition, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain brittle in contact-rich and dynamic manipulation tasks, where minor execution deviations can compound into failures. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled path to robustness, on-policy RL in the physical world is constrained by safety risk, hardware cost, and environment reset. To bridge this gap, we present RISE, a scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is a Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via a controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with a progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. These components are integrated into a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that continuously generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates the policy in imaginary space without costly physical interaction. Across three challenging real-world tasks, RISE yields significant improvement over prior art, with more than +35% absolute performance increase in dynamic brick sorting, +45% for backpack packing, and +35% for box closing, respectively.
