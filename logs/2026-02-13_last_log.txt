Text:"6 2 0 2 2 1 ] . [ 1 2 9 7 1 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r a Hongbo Zhang 1 2 * Yang Yue 3 Jianhao Yan 2 Guangsheng Bao 2 Yue Zhang Yue Zhang 2 Abstract Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR finetunes models based on reward feedback from selfgenerated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-kNN Distance, simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for given prompt and computing the average of the smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. MinkNN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-kNN Distance reliably distinguishes RLseen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines. The project page is available at https://stevenzhb.github. io/detect-rlvr-data/. 1. Introduction Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in reasoning performance, particularly on benchmarks with verifiable answers such as mathematics (Guo et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025; He et al., 2025), coding (Seed et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025), and symbolic problem solving (Xie et al., 2025). key driver behind these gains is reinforcement * Work done during an internship at Kuaishou Technology.

Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards induces behavioral signatures that can be detected using a black-box method based on prompt generation diversity, outperforming existing contamination detection approaches.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-kNN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the k smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-kNN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-kNN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.
