In current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) safety workflow, evaluation, diagnosis, and alignment are often handled by separate tools. Specifically, safety evaluation can only locate external behavioral risks but cannot figure out internal root causes. Meanwhile, safety diagnosis often drifts from concrete risk scenarios and remains at the explainable level. In this way, safety alignment lack dedicated explanations of changes in internal mechanisms, potentially degrading general capabilities. To systematically address these issues, we propose an open-source project, namely DeepSight, to practice new safety evaluation-diagnosis integrated paradigm. DeepSight is low-cost, reproducible, efficient, and highly scalable large-scale model safety evaluation project consisting of evaluation toolkit DeepSafe and diagnosis toolkit DeepScan. By unifying task and data protocols, we build connection between the two stages and transform safety evaluation from black-box to white-box insight. Besides, DeepSight is the first open source toolkit that support the frontier AI risk evaluation and joint safety evaluation and diagnosis. 6 2 0 2 2 1 ] .

As these models are increasingly integrated into critical applications (Chu et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2026b), the industry faces an urgent need to ensure they operate within secure and ethical boundaries. However, the current landscape of safety evaluation remains fractured between black-box assessment and white-box insight. While the industry has established robust evaluation frameworks, ranging from OpenAI Evals (OpenAI, 2023) and Inspect (UK AI Security Institute, 2024) to comprehensive platforms like OpenCompass (Contributors, 2023) and HELM (Liang et al., 2022), these tools primarily focus on quantifying behavior capabilities instead of safety mechanisms. Conversely, diagnostic research has made significant strides in decoding internal mechanisms, including probing latent geometric boundaries, identifying safety-specific neurons, and analyzing reasoning dynamics via information flow (Qian et al., 2024a; 2025; Burns et al., 2022; Zou et al., 2023). Yet, these diagnostic methods often operate in isolation from standardized benchmarks, treating internal representation analysis as separate academic pursuit rather than debugging tool for deployment risks. To systematically address these issues, we propose DeepSight, an open-source project, that proposes and implements new safety evaluation-diagnosis integrated paradigm. By unifying task and data protocols, DeepSight connects evaluation and diagnosis. In this way, researchers and developers not only identify what went wrong but also understand how safety concepts are encoded internally, facilitating more reliable and interpretable repairs. DeepSight is composed of two core engines: DeepSafe: modular, configuration-driven framework for multimodal LLM/MLLM evaluation that integrates over 20 safety benchmarks. More importantly, DeepSafe also supports the evaluation of frontier AI risks, i.e., high-severity risks (Lab et al., 2025). It provides low-cost, reproducible, efficient, and highly scalable large-scale model security evaluation toolkit for researchers and professional developers. DeepScan: standardized and extensible framework equipped with suite of LLM diagnostic tools. It efficiently locates key layers and neurons to probe representation-level structures and objective-level conflicts without modifying model weights. To the best of our knowledge, DeepSight is the first open source toolkit that support the frontier AI risk evaluation and joint safety evaluation and diagn"

[ 1 8 4 7 1 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aAchieving effective test-time scaling requires models to engage in In-Context Exploration the intrinsic ability to generate, verify, and refine multiple reasoning hypotheses within single continuous context. Grounded in State Coverage theory, our analysis identifies critical bottleneck to enabling this capability: while broader state coverage requires longer reasoning trajectories, the probability of sampling such sequences decays exponentially during autoregressive generation, phenomenon we term the Shallow Exploration Trap. To bridge this gap, we propose LengthIncentivized Exploration(LIE). This simple yet effective recipe explicitly encourages models to explore more via length-based reward coupled with redundancy penalty, thereby maximizing state coverage in two-step manner. Comprehensive experiments across different models (Qwen3, Llama) demonstrate that LIE effectively incentivize in-context exploration. As result, our method achieves an average improvement of 4.4% on in-domain tasks and 2.7% gain on out-ofdomain benchmarks. Our code is publicly available in https://github.com/LINs-lab /LIE. 1. Introduction Scaling test-time computation, often conceptualized as enabling models to think harder before answering, has emerged as powerful paradigm for breaking the performance ceiling of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Snell et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025a).

The difference between In-Context Exploration and Training Exploration. Our framework distinguishes between the exploration of the training process and in-context inference. In the training phase, reinforcement learning incentivizes the model to explore and learn from diverse state distributions. In contrast, during test-time inference, in-context exploration empowers the model to actively traverse and navigate states. Test-Time Scaling (TTS) strategies fall into two primary regimes: Parallel Scaling (Lightman et al., 2023; Snell et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025a; Brown et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2022), which aggregates outputs from multiple independent samples, and Sequential Scaling (Guo et al., 2025; Jaech et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024), which prioritizes extended reasoning chains or iterative refinement. While Parallel Scaling structures the search space externally, Sequential Scaling via Long CoT represents an intrinsic dimension of TTS, as it directly harnesses the models intrinsic reasoning capabilities (Snell et al., 2024). One iconic capability among this intrinsic reasoning is incontext exploration (Setlur et al., 2025), which is achieved through the generation, verification, and refinement of multiple hypotheses within continuous context (Gandhi et al., 2024; Setlur et al., 2025). Consequently, fostering such in-context exploration serves as the critical catalyst for unlocking the full potential of sequential scaling. As illustrated in Figure 1, in-context exploration enables the model to sequentially traverse diverse reasoning states to find the correct answer. However, how to effectively train LLMs to Learn to Explore In-Context via Length-Incentivized Reinforcement Learning acquire in-context exploration remains underexplored. 2. Related Work To study this problem, we first analyze the bottleneck of in-context exploration through the lens of Count-Based Exploration theory in RL training (Auer, 2002), which establishes state coverage as fundamental proxy for exploration quality. We extend the theory into test-time in-context exploration and adopt state coverage, the in-context state diversity, as theoretical proxy for the exploration quality. Figure 1 demonstrates the difference between in-context exploration and the classic rl training exploration. Our theoretical analysis of state coverage exposes critical bottleneck (Remark 4.3): achieving broader state coverage requires longer reasoning sequences, yet such sequences face exponentially diminishing sampling probabilities (Shallow Exploration Trap) (Lemma 4.2). Empirically, we analyze the training dynamics of GSPO and GRPO baselines. Our observations validate our theoretical results and also reveal that these methods implicitly incentivize response length to some degree, while decreasing states density (Section 4.3). This observation prompts our primary research question: How to effectively incentivize in-context exploration in RL for test-time scaling? To address this, we propose Length-Incentivized Exploration (LIE), an RL recipe that maximizes in-context state coverage, in two-step manner. The length reward elevates the upper bound of states, and the redundancy penalty matches the number of states given length (as introduced in Section 5). Experiments demonstrate that LIE significantly improves performance compared to GRPO and GSPO baselines across diverse models (Qwen3 (Yang et al., 2025a) and LLaMA (Meta, 2024)). Specifically, our method achieves consistent performance boosts, yielding 4.4% average gain on in-domain reasoning tasks and 2.7% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks, underscoring its superior generalization capabilities. Our key contributions are summarized as follows: Identifying the In-Context Exploration Bottleneck.. We identify Shallow Exploration Trap as the bottleneck of in-context exploration, substantiating its existence through both theoretical derivations (Proposition 4.1 & Lemma 4.2) and empirical validations (Figure 3). Length-Incentivized Exploration (LIE) Recipe. We propose simple yet effective training recipe that explicitly incentivizes the model to overcome the bottleneck, enabling the model to explore during both training and inference. Empirical Validation and Test-Time Scaling. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LIE significantly outperforms standard baselines, achieving effective test-time scaling and eliciting more cognitive behaviors.

DeepSight is an open-source project that integrates safety evaluation and diagnosis for large language and multimodal models, enabling white-box insights through unified protocols and specialized toolkits.  					AI-generated summary 				 As the development of Large Models (LMs) progresses rapidly, their safety is also a priority. In current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) safety workflow, evaluation, diagnosis, and alignment are often handled by separate tools. Specifically, safety evaluation can only locate external behavioral risks but cannot figure out internal root causes. Meanwhile, safety diagnosis often drifts from concrete risk scenarios and remains at the explainable level. In this way, safety alignment lack dedicated explanations of changes in internal mechanisms, potentially degrading general capabilities. To systematically address these issues, we propose an open-source project, namely DeepSight, to practice a new safety evaluation-diagnosis integrated paradigm. DeepSight is low-cost, reproducible, efficient, and highly scalable large-scale model safety evaluation project consisting of a evaluation toolkit DeepSafe and a diagnosis toolkit DeepScan. By unifying task and data protocols, we build a connection between the two stages and transform safety evaluation from black-box to white-box insight. Besides, DeepSight is the first open source toolkit that support the frontier AI risk evaluation and joint safety evaluation and diagnosis.

Models require in-context exploration capabilities to scale effectively at test time, but autoregressive generation faces exponential decay in sampling long sequences, which is addressed by a length-incentivized exploration method that improves performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Achieving effective test-time scaling requires models to engage in In-Context Exploration -- the intrinsic ability to generate, verify, and refine multiple reasoning hypotheses within a single continuous context.   Grounded in State Coverage theory, our analysis identifies a critical bottleneck to enabling this capability: while broader state coverage requires longer reasoning trajectories, the probability of sampling such sequences decays exponentially during autoregressive generation, a phenomenon we term the ``Shallow Exploration Trap''.   To bridge this gap, we propose Length-Incentivized Exploration(\method).   This simple yet effective recipe explicitly encourages models to explore more via a length-based reward coupled with a redundancy penalty, thereby maximizing state coverage in two-step manner.   Comprehensive experiments across different models (Qwen3, Llama) demonstrate that \method effectively incentivize in-context exploration.   As a result, our method achieves an average improvement of 4.4\% on in-domain tasks and a 2.7\% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks.

A lightweight 5B unified multimodal model achieves competitive performance through hierarchical feature extraction, learnable think tokens, and progressive training strategies including alignment pre-training, joint supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with MR-GRPO.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current unified multimodal models for image generation and editing typically rely on massive parameter scales (e.g., >10B), entailing prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.

We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research."

Personalized generative reward models address challenges in adapting language model responses to individual user preferences by using structured evaluation chains and dual-granularity scaling mechanisms for improved generalization and accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Personalized alignment of large language models seeks to adapt responses to individual user preferences, typically via reinforcement learning. A key challenge is obtaining accurate, user-specific reward signals in open-ended scenarios. Existing personalized reward models face two persistent limitations: (1) oversimplifying diverse, scenario-specific preferences into a small, fixed set of evaluation principles, and (2) struggling with generalization to new users with limited feedback. To this end, we propose P-GenRM, the first Personalized Generative Reward Model with test-time user-based scaling. P-GenRM transforms preference signals into structured evaluation chains that derive adaptive personas and scoring rubrics across various scenarios. It further clusters users into User Prototypes and introduces a dual-granularity scaling mechanism: at the individual level, it adaptively scales and aggregates each user's scoring scheme; at the prototype level, it incorporates preferences from similar users. This design mitigates noise in inferred preferences and enhances generalization to unseen users through prototype-based transfer. Empirical results show that P-GenRM achieves state-of-the-art results on widely-used personalized reward model benchmarks, with an average improvement of 2.31%, and demonstrates strong generalization on an out-of-distribution dataset. Notably, Test-time User-based scaling provides an additional 3% boost, demonstrating stronger personalized alignment with test-time scalability.
