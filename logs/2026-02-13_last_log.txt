[ 1 1 9 8 9 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aMusic stem generation, the task of producing musically-synchronized and isolated instrument audio clips, offers the potential of greater user control and better alignment with musician workflows compared to conventional text-to-music models. Existing stem generation approaches, however, either rely on fixed architectures that output predefined set of stems in parallel, or generate only one stem at time, resulting in slow sequential inference despite flexibility in stem combination. We propose STEMPHONIC, diffusion-/flow-based framework that overcomes this trade-off and generates variable set of synchronized stems in one inference pass. During training, we treat each stem as batch element, group synchronized stems in batch, and apply shared noise latent to each group. At inferencetime, we use shared initial noise latent and stem-specific text inputs to generate synchronized multi-stem outputs in one pass. We further expand our approach to enable one-pass conditional multi-stem generation and stem-wise activity controls to empower users to iteratively generate and orchestrate the temporal layering of mix. We benchmark our results on multiple open-source stem evaluation sets and show that STEMPHONIC produces higher-quality outputs while accelerating the full mix generation process by 2550%. Demos at: https://stemphonic-demo.vercel.app. Index Terms music audio generation, stem generation, conditional stem generation, variable stem combinations, diffusion, flow. 1. INTRODUCTION Text-to-audio music generation models are now able to produce realistic sounding music from simple text inputs [15]. They lower the barrier for music creation, enabling anyone to explore and express their creativity, but typically generate fully-mixed multi-instrument outputs that are difficult to edit and cannot easily be reused as components in new compositions [6,7]. To empower creators beyond text prompting, numerous control and editing methods have been proposed, including fine-grained temporal controls [810], music inpainting [1012], as well as music stem generation [1316]. music stem is recording of one or more instruments that collectively serve as distinct layer in mix, e.g., drums for rhythmic foundation, and basses for low-pitch progressions. Generating stems enables creators to edit each stem separately and experiment with different mixing/mastering techniques, enhancing their creative control [17, 18]. Existing stem generation methods can largely be classified into (1) models with parallelized architecture, and (2) individual-stem models that require sequential generation of stems. Parallelized models [1316] generate multiple coherent stems in single pass, but handle limited, coarse-grained stem types (e.g., only basses, drums, vocals, others) that must be fixed in advance and built into the architecture. Individual-stem models [1923], on the other hand, allow * Work done while an intern at Adobe Research. Fig. 1. Our STEMPHONIC framework for flexible multi-stem music generation. (Top) At training, each group of synchronized stems share the same noise latent. (Bottom) At inference, we use shared initial noise to generate variable multi-stem outputs in one pass. We also enable conditional stem generation and stem-wise activity controls. flexible open-vocabulary stem generations through text prompting or other conditioning mechanisms, and can often condition on existing audio to iteratively generate new accompanying stems and create mix with an arbitrary number of stems. Yet, these models generate stems one at time, leading to slower full inference processes. To unify the strengths of both paradigms and alleviate their drawbacks, we propose STEMPHONIC, latent diffusion/flow-based [24, 25] framework capable of generating variable set of musicallysynchronized stems in one inference pass, as shown in Fig. 1. We introduce two techniques applied during training. First, we treat each stem as batch element and group musically-synchronized stems in batch (Sec. 3.1). Then, we assign single shared noise latent to each group (Sec. 3.2). At inference, we use shared initial noise and different stem-specific text inputs to generate variably many synchronized stem outputs in one pass. We further expand our approach to conditional multi-stem generation, and add stem-wise activity controls (Sec. 3.3) that enable creators to iteratively generate and orchestrate the temporal layering of mix. In our experiments, we ablate our stem grouping and noise sharing core techniques, and verify the conditional generation and stem-wise activity control capabilities. We find STEMPHONIC capable of generating higher-quality multi-stem mixes, while accelerating the full inference process by 2550%, compared to the existing individual-stem iterative workflow. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: latent diffusion/flow-based framework to generate variable number of synchronized stems efficiently in one inference pass, either from-scratch, or conditioned on existing audio. method for precise activity control of individual stem outputs. Quantitative evaluation and qualitative demo examples showing high-quality outputs, and flexible composer-like workflows. Overall, we combine the speed of parallelized models with the openvocabulary freedom of individual-stem models to offer an efficient and highly-controllable stem generation framework. 2. BACKGROUND We build upon latent diffusion [26] and rectified flow (RF) [24] generative models with Transformer backbone [27], referred to as diffusion Transformer (DiT) for simplicity. We initialize our DiT with weights from base model pretrained on general music mixes, and then finetune it on isolated stems with the following RF objective: min θ (xk,Ck) data ϵ (0, ITDTD ) LogitNormalµ,σ (0,1) (cid:13) (cid:13) (cid:13)vθ (cid:0)xk(t), t, Ck (cid:1) (cid:0)xk ϵ(cid:1)(cid:13) 2 (cid:13) (cid:13) 2 , (1) where xk RTD is the variational autoencoder (VAE) audio latents being modeled, is the stem index, is the number of VAE latent frames (i.e., the time dimension), is the frame-wise dimensionality, θ is the set of trainable DiT parameters, Ck is any arbitrary conditions associated with stem xk that enable user control (e.g., stem type, audio mix of existing stems, text description, and tempo), ϵ RTD is the "

Stemphonic is a diffusion- and flow-based framework that generates variable sets of synchronized musical stems in single inference passes, improving both quality and efficiency over existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Music stem generation, the task of producing musically-synchronized and isolated instrument audio clips, offers the potential of greater user control and better alignment with musician workflows compared to conventional text-to-music models. Existing stem generation approaches, however, either rely on fixed architectures that output a predefined set of stems in parallel, or generate only one stem at a time, resulting in slow inference despite flexibility in stem combination. We propose Stemphonic, a diffusion-/flow-based framework that overcomes this trade-off and generates a variable set of synchronized stems in one inference pass. During training, we treat each stem as a batch element, group synchronized stems in a batch, and apply a shared noise latent to each group. At inference-time, we use a shared initial noise latent and stem-specific text inputs to generate synchronized multi-stem outputs in one pass. We further expand our approach to enable one-pass conditional multi-stem generation and stem-wise activity controls to empower users to iteratively generate and orchestrate the temporal layering of a mix. We benchmark our results on multiple open-source stem evaluation sets and show that Stemphonic produces higher-quality outputs while accelerating the full mix generation process by 25 to 50%.

Авторы решают проблему существующих методов, которые либо используют фиксированную архитектуру с предопределённым числом стемов, либо генерируют их поочередно, что замедляет процесс. Ключевая идея заключается в применении общего шумового латентного вектора для синхронизированных стемов во время обучения и использовании общего начального шума с индивидуальными текстовыми промптами при инференсе.
