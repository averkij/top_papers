Critically, GigaBrain-0.5M* exhibits reliable long-horizon execution, consistently accomplishing complex manipulation tasks without failure as validated by real-world deployment videos on our project page. 1. Introduction Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models (Bjorck et al., 2025; Black et al., 2024; Bu et al., 2025; Cheang et al., 2025; Intelligence et al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025; Zhai et al., 2025) have demonstrated compelling results in understanding instructions, perceiving environments, and executing complex manipulation. Nevertheless, fundamental limitation persists in mainstream VLA architectures: their 2026 GigaAI. All rights reserved. GigaBrain-0.5M*: VLA That Learns From World Model-Based Reinforcement Learning reliance on myopic observations for long-horizon action planning, this shortcoming stems from an architectural bias toward reactive control rather than prospective planning. Conversely, foundation world models trained on massive-scale video corpora have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in forecasting plausible future states, such predictive priors offer pathway to endow VLAs with foresight. Therefore, we introduce GigaBrain-0.5M*, VLA model trained via world model-based reinforcement learning. Specifically, GigaBrain-0.5M* extends GigaBrain-0.5M (our latest VLA pre-trained on over 10K hours of realworld robotic interaction data) with RAMP (Reinforcement leArning via world Model-conditioned Policy). The RAMP pipeline operates in four iterative stages: (1) The world model is pretrained with large-scale robot manipulation data to predict value and future states. (2) The policy is fine-tuned by conditioning actions on the world models predicted value and future state. (3) Deploy the policy in real environments, producing robot rollout data with human-in-the-loop intervention. (4) Continual training world model and policy with rollout data. This iterative training paradigm enables self-improvement. Therefore, we introduce GigaBrain-0.5M*, VLA model trained via world model-based reinforcement learning. Specifically, GigaBrain-0.5M* extends GigaBrain-0.5M (our latest VLA pretrained on over 10K hours of realworld robotic interaction data) by integrating RAMP (Reinforcement leArning via world Model-conditioned Policy). The RAMP framework follows an iterative four-stage training paradigm. First, the world model is pretrained on large-scale robot manipulation data to forecast future states and associated value. Second, the policy undergoes fine-tuning by conditioning its action selection on the world models predicted futures and value estimates. Third, the conditioned policy is deployed in physical environments to collect rollout trajectories under human-in-the-loop intervention. Fourth, both the world model and policy are jointly refined using the curated rollout dataset. This iterative training paradigm enables continual learning and self-improvement. The proposed RAMP is inspired by RECAP in 𝜋* (Intelligence et al., 2025), as both approaches utilize additional 0.6 information as conditions for the VLA model. However, RECAP only uses sparse advantages (0 or 1) as input, providing limited information gain. In contrast, our proposed RAMP leverages future states predicted by well-pretrained world model, yielding substantial information gain. Furthermore, we theoretically verify that RECAP is special case of RAMP. In our experiments, we first conduct comprehensive internal evaluations to assess the performance of GigaBrain0.5 against strong baselines, including 𝜋0.5 (Intelligence et al., 2025) and GigaBrain-0 (Team et al., 2025). Our method achieves state-of-the-art success rates across diverse suite of manipulation tasks, with particularly pronounced advantages on challenging deformable object manipulation and long-horizon procedural tasks. Furthermore, an intermediate version of GigaBrain-0.5 secured the top position on the public RoboChallenge benchmark leaderboard (RoboChallenge Team). We additionally perform extensive ablation studies to analyze the impact of different reinforcement learning algorithms on real-robot performance. Results demonstrate that our proposed RAMP significantly outperforms alternative approaches such as AWR (Peng et al., 2019) and RECAP (Intelligence et al., 2025), yielding superior multi-task generalization and markedly improved sample efficiency during policy learning. Notably, GigaBrain-0.5M* exhibits robust long-horizon reasoning capabilities, seamlessly executing complex sequential tasks, includ"

However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability. The code is available at https://github.com/yxy-919/LawThinker-agent.

However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration; (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by curriculum-like transitionprioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across both LLMs and MLLMs. Keywords: Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, LLM Reasoning Date: February 5, 2026 Code Repository: https://github.com/HKU-HealthAI/A-GRAE Contact: zhiqiyu777@connect.hku.hk 1.

[ 1 1 4 5 1 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aWe study budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, where large language model must solve multi-step tasks by invoking external tools under strict monetary budget. We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive stateaction spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across costaugmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets. 1. Introduction Large language models are rapidly evolving into agentic systems that can autonomously decompose complex tasks, interact with external tools, and execute multi-step plans. Recent systems demonstrate strong capabilities in deep research (OpenAI, 2025; Team et al., 2025), software engineering (Yang et al., 2024a), and web automation (Google, 2026), where reasoning and tool use are tightly interleaved. Tools constitute the primary interface through which agents interact with the external world and incur real-world impact. With the emergence of standardized protocols such as MCP (Anthropic, 2025) and large-scale tool marketplaces (RapidAPI, 2014; Market, 2025; MCP.so, 2025), agents now have access to thousands of heterogeneous APIs. While this dramatically expands the action space, it also introduces 1Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China 2Shanghai University of Finance and Economics 3Baidu Inc.. Correspondence to: Qi Qi <qi.qi@ruc.edu.cn>. Preprint. February 13, 2026. 1 Figure 1. Budget awareness of agentic language models on tool cost-augmented StableToolBench. Standalone agents frequently violate hard budget constraints, and prompt-based cost feedback remains insufficient to guarantee budget feasibility or approach the achievable performance upper bound. Our lightweight online planning framework INTENT helps bridge this gap. critical but underexplored dimension: ECONOMIC COST. Unlike token generation, whose marginal cost continues to decline drastically (Appenzeller, 2024; Cottier et al., 2025), many tools expose scarce and monetized resources, such as real-time financial market feeds, high-resolution satellite imagery or irrevocable blockchain state changes. As agentic systems mature, the central question is no longer whether they can solve complex tasks, but whether we can delegate economically consequential decisions to them. fundamental question arises: Can we trust agentic models to make cost-sensitive tool-use decisions on our behalf? To probe this question, we instantiate budgeted tool-use setting on top of the widely used StableToolBench (Qin et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024), where each task comes with hard budget constraint and diverse per-call tool prices. As shown in Figure 1, our findings reveal significant gap: even when explicitly provided with budget feedback after each tool call (PROMPT), strong models frequently exceed the budget due to repetitive retries and unproductive exploration. More advanced reasoning models exhibit better compliance, but only by becoming overly conservative, leaving large performance gap to the achievable upper bound. Such budgeted tool-use scenarios are not rare in practice. For instance, financial analyst may rely on agentic workflow to monitor hundreds of stocks on daily basis, and, to control operational expenditure, impose strict per-ticker Budget-Constrained Agentic Large Language Models spending limit when gathering evidence about fundamentals and public sentiment. For each ticker, the agent then faces spectrum of priced tool set: near-free but noisy web search may require repeated retries, official filings databases are moderately priced yet brittle to query formulations, and premium data APIs are accurate but can consume most of the budget in one shot. In such cases, myopic choices like overspending early on expensive tools or looping on unreliable cheap calls can render the remaining subtasks infeasible even when each individual step appears reasonable. Beyond finance, similar cost-capped tool-use patterns arise in many real-world pipelines (e.g., legal due diligence and cloud incidence diagnosis), and become particularly pronounced when agents are deployed at scale and invoked repeatedly. This setting exposes non-trivial challenge. Agents must make sequential tool-use decisions under high stochasticity, where actions may incur real economic cost, tool outcomes are uncertain, and neither free interaction nor retraining is available at inference time. Moreover, the tool market itself is dynamic: available tools and their prices may change with time, and new tools may appear without prior experience. Motivated by these observations and examples, in this work, we study concrete instantiation of cost-sensitive tool use that captures these challenges while remaining amenable to principled analysis. Each task consists of user query and task-specific tool market, where finite available tools have heterogeneous per-call prices. The agent must decide which tools to invoke, in what order, and when to terminate, so as to solve the task under hard budget constraint. At first glance, this problem appears amenable to several natural solution strategies. One may attempt to cast it as an online knapsack (Buchbinder & Naor, 2009; Agrawal et al., 2009) or linear programming variant, allocating the budget across tools based on their shadow prices. However, such formulations assume independent, additive utilities and fail to capture the strong sequential dependencies between tool calls, where the value of an action is primarily determined by the information it enables for subsequent decisions.

However, many real-world applicationssuch as voice assistants, live captioning, and interactive speech interfacesrequire transcriptions to be produced in real time while audio is streaming, under strict latency constraints. Bridging the gap between offline transcription quality and real-time streaming remains central challenge in speech recognition [Graves, 2012, Zeghidour et al., 2025]. common approach to streaming adapts offline models by processing audio in short chunks as it arrives [Macháˇcek et al., 2023]. While effective at moderate latencies, this strategy has fundamental limitation: offline models are typically trained with access to bidirectional acoustic context (and often full-sequence conditioning), whereas streaming system must emit tokens before future audio is available. This traininginference mismatch becomes increasingly severe as latency is reduced, and often leads to degraded accuracy in low-delay regimes and out-of-distribution settings. Native streaming architectures address this by reformulating the learning problem so that each output token is predicted using only past inputs and bounded amount of lookahead, making latency tunable constraint. This requires (i) an explicit alignment between input audio and output text (e.g., wordor frame-level alignments), and (ii) an architecture that processes new audio incrementally as it arrives. common instantiation is neural transducer (RNN-T) with streaming encoder that limits right context through chunking, memory, and caching [Graves, 2012, Shi et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2021, Noroozi et al., 2024]. Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM) [Zeghidour et al., 2025] follows the same alignmentbased principle, but replaces the transducer with decoder-only model over aligned audio and text streams, enabling simpler designs that leverage pre-trained language decoders. DSM approaches offline accuracy at high delay settings. However, achieving offline-level performance at sub-second latencyparticularly in multilingual and multi-domain settingshas remained an open challenge. We address this challenge by introducing Voxtral Realtime, 4B parameter natively streaming ASR model that supports 13 languages. Concretely, our contributions are: causal audio encoder trained from scratch with modern architectural choices (RMSNorm, SwiGLU, RoPE, sliding window attention). An adaptive RMS-Norm (Ada RMS-Norm) mechanism in the decoder, enabling single model to operate at any delay that is multiple of 80 ms. Pretraining at scale on large-scale dataset spanning 13 languages, enabling robust generalization across languages and domains. At delay of 480 ms, Voxtral Realtime achieves performance competitive with Whisper [Radford et al., 2023] and ElevenLabs Scribe v2 Realtime [ElevenLabs Team, 2026]. At higher delay settings (e.g., 960 ms), it matches or surpasses strong offline baselines such as Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 on several English and multilingual benchmarks [Mistral AI Team, 2026]. These results demonstrate that offlinelevel transcription quality can be achieved within fully streaming framework at sub-second latency. We release the resulting model as open weights under the Apache 2.0 license. The remainder of this report details the model architecture, training and inference methodology, and empirical evaluations that support these findings.Voxtral Realtime is Transformer-based streaming ASR model that follows the stream-synchronous design of DSM. The model comprises (i) causal audio encoder, (ii) temporal adapter that downsamples encoder frames, and (iii) Transformer decoder that generates text autoregressively. At each stream step, the decoder consumes fused representation obtained by summing the currentstep audio embedding with the embedding of the most recently generated text token. The overall architecture is summarized in Figure 2, with model dimensions outlined in Table 1. 2 Figure 2: Voxtral Realtime architecture and decoding scheme for target delay τ = 80 ms. Voxtral Realtime consists of causal audio encoder to embed the input audio stream, an MLP adapter layer to temporally downsample the audio embeddings, and text decoder to auto-regressively generate the output text stream. The downsampled audio embeddings from the adapter and the embeddings of previously generated tokens have the same frame-rate of 12.5Hz, with each frame representing 80ms of audio. These are summed and processed by the text decoder, which predicts one token per frame. The decoder emits padding token [P] while waiting for sufficient acoustic evidence. Once word is acoustically complete and the target delay τ has elapsed, word-boundary token [W] is emitted to initiate generation, followed by the corresponding subword tokens.

[ 1 4 9 1 8 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Open-ended learning frames intelligence as emerging from continual interaction with an everexpanding space of environments. While recent advances have utilized foundation models to programmatically generate diverse environments, these approaches often focus on discovering isolated behaviors rather than orchestrating sustained progression. In complex open-ended worlds, the large combinatorial space of possible challenges makes it difficult for agents to discover sequences of experiences that remain consistently learnable. To address this, we propose Dreaming in Code (DiCode), framework in which foundation models synthesize executable environment code to scaffold learning toward increasing competence. In DiCode, dreaming takes the form of materializing code-level variations of the world. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression. Empirically, DiCode enables agents to acquire long-horizon skills, achieving 16% improvement in mean return over the strongest baseline and non-zero success on late-game combat tasks where prior methods fail. Our results suggest that code-level environment design provides practical mechanism for curriculum control, enabling the construction of intermediate environments that bridge competence gaps in open-ended worlds.

February 10, 2026. 1 While the central promise of open-ended learning lies in the emergence of unbounded intelligence, agents operating in such vast domains often exhibit familiar trajectory: rapid early gains followed by pronounced performance plateau (Wang et al., 2019; Kuttler et al., 2020; Matthews et al., 2024; 2025). Despite substantial advances in learning algorithms and agent architectures (Team et al., 2023; Hafner et al., 2024), progress in open-ended worlds does not automatically follow from knowing how to learn when suitable experience is lacking (Clune, 2020; Jiang et al., 2022b). Sustaining improvement therefore requires continual stream of experiences that remain both novel and learnable, which in turn demands mechanisms for actively shaping and generating an agents experience over time (Bengio et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2019; Dennis et al., 2021; Hughes et al., 2024). This challenge has been studied under the framework of Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), which seeks to automatically adapt or generate environments to maintain Goldilocks level of difficulty for learning agents (Dennis et al., 2021). By controlling the environments from which experience is drawn, UED addresses the stagnation that arises when fixed environments cease to offer meaningful learning signal (Jiang et al., 2022a; Parker-Holder et al., 2023). However, most UED methods are restricted to low-dimensional parameters and rely on search procedures that assume smooth, well-structured design space (ParkerHolder et al., 2023). These assumptions are restrictive in open-ended domains, where sustaining learning requires curriculum of structurally evolving environments that introduce long-horizon dependencies (Matthews et al., 2024). As result, despite its conceptual appeal, the application of UED to truly open-ended problems remains limited. Recent progress in environment design has begun to relax these limitations by representing environments as executable programs (Liang et al., 2024; Faldor et al., 2025). Instead of tuning fixed set of parameters, environment logic can now be programmatically specified and composed, enabling richly structured worlds with diverse dynamics. Leveraging foundation models (FMs), Faldor et al. (2025) have shown that such expressive programmatic environment spaces can be effectively explored to synthesize environments that are Dreaming in Code for Curriculum Learning in Open-Ended Worlds Figure 1. Overview of the Dreaming in Code framework. The pipeline consists of two interleaved processes: Training (top) and the Generation Cycle (bottom). In the generation cycle, parent level is selected from the Archive based on learnability. Conditioning the foundation model on the parent level and the agents current competence, it synthesizes new level description and subsequent executable Python code. Levels that pass compilation check are added to the Training Batch, which mixes the target environment, newly generated levels, and archived levels sampled via PLR. Agent performance and new levels update the archive, closing the curriculum loop. novel and learnable in isolation. However, because these methods treat environments as disjoint challenges, they do not focus on generating the curricula required to sustain progress in open-ended domains. In such settings, sustained learning requires coordinating sequences of environments that progressively build on prior capabilities. These considerations highlight the need for UED methods that can operate directly over programmatic environment representations to orchestrate this structural evolution. We bridge this gap with Dreaming in Code (DiCode), UED framework designed to scaffold progress in complex, open-ended target environments those in which the agent must make sustained progress. In DiCode, an FM dreams new environment instances by synthesizing executable generation logic, conditioned on the agents current capabilities. Crucially, this logic is executed by fixed world engine. This engine can take various forms depending on the application, such as game engine for video games (e.g., Craftax (Matthews et al., 2024)) or physics engine for robotics (e.g., MuJoCo (Todorov et al., 2012)). By utilizing the engine directly rather than learning world model, DiCode ensures that all generated experiences adhere to valid physics and consistent mechanics. Consequently, the act of dreaming here serves not to improve sample efficiency, but to construct curriculum that enables agents to acquire increasingly complex behaviors in open-ended worlds. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, challenging open-ended reinforcement lear"

Text:"DVOTING: Fast Voting for dLLMs Sicheng Feng 1 Zigeng Chen 1 Xinyin Ma 1 Gongfan Fang 1 Xinchao Wang 1 *Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) represent new paradigm beyond autoregressive modeling, offering competitive performance while naturally enabling flexible decoding process. Specifically, dLLMs can generate tokens at arbitrary positions in parallel, endowing them with significant potential for parallel test-time scaling, which was previously constrained by severe inefficiency in autoregressive modeling. In this work, we introduce DVOTING, fast voting technique that boosts reasoning capability without training, with only an acceptable extra computational overhead. DVOTING is motivated by the observation that, across multiple samples for the same prompt, token predictions remain largely consistent, whereas performance is determined by small subset of tokens exhibiting cross-sample variability. Leveraging the arbitrary-position generation capability of dLLMs, DVOTING performs iterative refinement by sampling, identifying uncertain tokens via consistency analysis, regenerating them through voting, and repeating this process until convergence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DVOTING consistently improves performance across various benchmarks. It achieves gains of 6.22%-7.66% on GSM8K, 4.40%-7.20% on MATH500, 3.16%-14.84% on ARC-C, and 4.83%-5.74% on MMLU. Our code is available at https://github.com/fscdc/dVoting 6 2 0 2 2 1 ] .

Through an iterative unmask-and-remask process, dLLMs enable parallel decoding in flexible order beyond left-to-right token generation in autoregressive LLMs, offering substantial flexibility and potential at test time. In dLLMs, recent efforts (Zhao et al., 2025a; Tang et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025b; Wang et al., 2025a; Yang et al., 2025a; Huang et al., 2025) for reasoning enhancement mainly focus on training time, primarily through reinforcement learning (RL) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Shao et al., 2024; Feng et al., 2025b). These RL approaches introduce novel training schemes and achieve notable performance improvements. Complementary to these training-time approaches, another line of work explores enhancing reasoning by operating directly on the decoding process at test time. Inspired by the success of test-time scaling in LLMs (Muennighoff et al., 2025; Snell et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025b; Sun et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2025) and recent findings that RL primarily improves sampling efficiency rather than intrinsic capability (Yue et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025c), we instead focus on inference. To date, few works have explored test-time scaling for reasoning enhancement in dLLMs. HEX (Lee et al., 2025) activates implicit semi-autoregressive experts by varying block sizes, while RFG (Chen et al., 2025a) guides generation at the logit level using an additional fine-tuned model. Although these methods can boost reasoning performance, they typically involve increased inference-time computation. Our goal is to reduce the substantial redundancy inherent in the voting paradigm. Based on the consistency analysis, we further identify simple yet crucial observation that repeated tokens frequently appear across multiple samples for the same input, as illustrated in Figure 2(b) and quantified in Table 1. Furthermore, we connect this observation with the remasking mechanism of dLLMs which allows the model to mask and regenerate an arbitrary number of decoded tokens at arbitrary positions within sequence1, making it well-suited to reduce the redundancy revealed by this observation. Accordingly, we 1e.g., dLLMs are very efficient at test time. dLLMs [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] at [MASK] time. dLLMs can be fast at inference time. DVOTING : Fast Voting for dLLMs Figure 1. Overview of DVOTING. For each prompt, our DVOTING preserves consistent tokens in previous generations and remasks the remaining tokens to initiate subsequent sampling, and terminates the process early when candidate answers satisfy consistent criteria. propose simple yet fast voting strategy (Figure 1). Specifically, we identify uncertain tokens based on token consistency, iteratively remask and regenerate them for refinement, and finally aggregate candidate answers via voting. We conduct extensive experiments across various reasoning benchmarks on two popular dLLMs (LLaDA (Nie et al., 2025) & Dream (Ye et al., 2025)) to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The results demonstrate that our method boosts the performance across all benchmarks covering mathematical, scientific, and general reasoning. For instance, our method yields performance gains of 6.22%7.66% on GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and 4.40%7.20% on MATH500 (Lightman et al., 2023) on LLaDA. Our method further achieves leading performanceefficiency trade-off. Additionally, we present the robustness of our method under various configurations. In conclusion, we propose DVOTING, training-free, simple yet effective voting strategy that boosts performance. Based on the empirical study, we identify and quantify key observation that many tokens are repeatedly generated across multiple sampling runs, and relate this to the remasking mechanism of dLLMs. Accordingly, we introduce the remask sampling strategy, which iteratively remasks and regenerates selected tokens to obtain multiple candidate generations and aggregates via voting to enhance performance. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of DVOTING. Together, DVOTING establishes the first baseline and provides foundation for efficient test-time scaling in dLLMs, further unlocking their potential at test time.Overview of Diffusion Language Models.

Text:"THINKROUTER: Efficient Reasoning via Routing Thinking between Latent and Discrete Spaces Xin Xu 1 Tong Yu 2 Xiang Chen 2 Haoliang Wang 2 Julian McAuley 1 Saayan Mitra 2 6 2 0 2 2 1 ] . [ 1 3 8 6 1 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aRecent work explores latent reasoning to improve reasoning efficiency by replacing explicit reasoning trajectories with continuous representations in latent space, yet its effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, THINKROUTER, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. THINKROUTER routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that THINKROUTER outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that THINKROUTER can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems (Huang & Chang, 2023; Wang et al., 2024). key driver <xinxucs@ucsd.edu> 1UC San Diego 2Adobe Research. Correspondence to: Saayan Mitra <smitra@adobe.com>. Preprint. February 13, 2026. 1 is explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), which emulates human thinking by generating intermediate reasoning trajectories in natural language (Wei et al., 2022; Feng et al., 2023; Chu et al., 2024). Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to reason with thinking trajectories before giving answers (Xu et al., 2025a; Li et al., 2025). Such reasoning-intensive training produces large reasoning models (LRMs), e.g., OpenAI o1 (Jaech et al., 2024) and Qwen3 (Yang et al., 2025a), which have demonstrated strong reasoning performance on hard tasks, such as mathematics and coding (Anthropic, 2024; Jimenez et al., 2024; Team, 2025a). While explicit trajectories improve reasoning accuracy and interpretability, they limit models expressive bandwidth (Zhu et al., 2025b). Meanwhile, long thinking chains substantially increase inference cost and response latency (Aggarwal & Welleck, 2025; Chen et al., 2025a). These developments highlight the two goals for efficient reasoning, i.e., improving reasoning accuracy while reducing generation length. To target this goal, recent work has explored LLM reasoning in latent space, shifting reasoning from discrete tokens to latent representations (Chen et al., 2025b). For example, Coconut (Hao et al., 2024), CCoT (Cheng & Durme, 2024), and LightThinker (Zhang et al., 2025b) construct several soft tokens to represent long thoughts to reduce tokens but require tuning, and their effectiveness varies across settings, where they even drop performance in some cases. Soft Thinking (Zhang et al., 2025c), training-free method by calculating token-probability-weighted soft embeddings, is proposed and can raise the performance ceiling (3.1). However, the underlying reason for its effectiveness has not fully explored (Wu et al., 2025). Meanwhile, few works (Shi et al., 2025) study whether hybrid reasoning between latent space and discrete spaces will help efficient reasoning. Therefore, we explore training-free LRM reasoning in hybrid reasoning spaces for efficient reasoning in this work. Since Soft Thinking performs much better than explicit CoT, we first analyze latent-only reasoning through LRM confidence dynamics with Soft Thinking (3.2). The maximum next-token probability is used as the proxy of LRM confidence (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2017; Guo et al., 2017). We observe that the reasoning trajectories for incorrect answer THINKROUTER: Efficient Reasoning via Routing Thinking between Latent and Discrete Spaces predictions have fewer low-confidence steps than those for correct answers. We also hypothesize that if the maximum next-token probability is low, the soft embedding is an aggregation of multiple low-confidence incompatible thinking alternatives, introducing representational noise. Such noise may propagate and accumulate across successive latent reasoning steps, leading the model to commit to an inadequately supported solution with high confidence. These observations motivate us to propose new, efficient reasoning solution that prevents LRMs from becoming highly confident and from representational noise. Therefore, we propose THINKROUTER, an inference-time mechanism that routes LRM thinking between the discrete token space and the latent space based on LRM confidence (4). Specifically, for each time step during thinking, when the maximum next-token probability is lower than routing threshold, THINKROUTER routes thinking to the discrete space where one next token is sampled to avoid introducing much noise and mitigate confidence. Otherwise, LRM conducts thinking in the latent space where probability-weighted soft embedding (following Soft Thinking) is calculated. THINKROUTER is evaluated (5) on LRMs with diverse scales (1.5B - 32B) and architectures (Qwen3 (Yang et al., 2025a) and gpt-oss (Agarwal et al., 2025)) and datasets with different domains (STEM reasoning and coding). Extensive experiments illustrate that THINKROUTER outperforms discrete CoT, Soft Thinking, and random routing in accuracy, improving average Pass@1 by up to 19.70 points, while reducing generation length comparably with the baselines. Moreover, we analyze the underlying reason for THINKROUTERs effectiveness. THINKROUTER can correct errors from explicit CoT and Soft Thinking. THINKROUTER can also increase the ratio of low-confidence time steps during thinking, indicating that THINKROUTER can prevent LRMs from becoming highly confident in incorrect solutions to improve accuracy. Meanwhile, we find that the steps immediately preceding the end-of-thi"

[ 1 6 3 6 1 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract Large-scale Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) has become key paradigm for advancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) across various multimodal tasks. However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the"

This bottleneck manifests primarily in two dimensions: (1) the compute bottleneck of computational complexity: for the standard attention mechanism, the computational cost grows quadratically with the sequence length , i.e., its complexity is O(N 2). When the context scales to the level of millions of tokens, the huge overhead causes the inference latency to increase dramatically; (2) the memory bottleneck of KV-Cache: during the auto-regressive generation process, the model must store the key and value states (KVs) of all historical contextual tokens to avoid redundant computation. For typical 8B-parameter model, even 1 MiniCPM-SALA when utilizing Grouped Query Attention (GQA) (Ainslie et al., 2023), the KV-Cache required for millions of tokens can reach dozens or even hundreds of gigabytes. To address the aforementioned challenges, existing solutions have developed two primary paradigms: Sparse Attention (Yuan et al., 2025; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Xiao et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2025) and Linear Attention (Yang et al., 2024a; Gu & Dao, 2024; Peng et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024b, 2025b). Both paradigms present distinct advantages and inherent limitations. Sparse attention methods attempt to break the compute bottleneck by computing only the most salient portions of the attention matrix, such as adopting sliding windows or global anchors. However, these methods are hindered by sparse computation, dense storage limitation. While local computation reduces immediate processing overhead, the model must still retain the full KV-Cache to support contextual information retrieval. Linear attention utilizes recurrent formulations to successfully reduce computational complexity to O(N ). Nevertheless, this extreme efficiency is achieved by the lossy compression of contextual information and inevitably results in performance degradation. MiniCPM-SALA employs hybrid architecture of sparse and linear attention (Chen et al., 2026), specifically designed to achieve efficient ultra-long sequence modeling. This architecture combines the high-fidelity long-context modeling capabilities of InfLLM-V2 (Zhao et al., 2025) and the global computational efficiency of Lightning Attention (Qin et al., 2024). Through this integrated approach, the model significantly mitigates inference overhead and memory consumption, while simultaneously addressing the precision bottleneck typical of pure linear architectures in long-range information processing. Consequently, MiniCPM-SALA provides balanced solution that maintains both efficiency and high performance for long-context tasks. Furthermore, we employ the continual training paradigm to transform pre-trained Transformer model into our hybrid model. By eschewing training from scratch, this approach significantly reduces the computational costs of model development. While several works have begun exploring the integration of sparse and linear attention (Hu et al., 2025; Hou et al., 2025; He & Garner, 2025), to the best of our knowledge, MiniCPM-SALA is the first to demonstrate through large-scale experimentation that these hybrids can match the performance of full-attention baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high efficiency and strong performance in long-context processing. In summary, the main contributions of this study can be outlined as follows: We introduce Sparse-Linear hybrid attention mechanism integrating 25% InfLLM-V2 and 75% Lightning Attention to strike balance between throughput and precision. By leveraging the granular focus of sparse attention for local details and the O(N ) efficiency of linear attention for broad context, the architecture maintains high semantic accuracy as the sequence length scales up. We demonstrate that the Transformer-to-hybrid paradigm is highly effective strategy for building strong hybrid models. This approach circumvents the inefficiencies of cold-start training by performing an architectural transformation on the pre-trained weights, thereby reducing the total training budget to approximately 25% relative to training comparable model from scratch. We adopt HyPE (Hybrid Positional Encoding) (Chen et al., 2026) to effectively harmonize the performance across both short and long contexts. While maintaining general capabilities (e.g., knowledge, mathematics, and coding) comparable to modern full-attention models like Qwen3-8B, MiniCPM-SALA has substantial advantages across multiple long-context benchmarks. MiniCPM-SALA demonstrates substantial resource savings and speed advantages"

PMLR: Volume 300. Copyright 2026 by the author(s). The tension between interpretability and predictive accuracy is central challenge in modern machine learning. While deep neural networks and other complex models have achieved remarkable success across range of domains, their opaque decision-making processes often hinder adoption in high-stakes settings where transparency and trust are paramount. In contrast, Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) (Hastie, 2017; Agarwal et al., 2021; Lou et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2022) are widely valued for their interpretability, the degree to which an observer can understand the cause of decision (Biran and Cotton, 2017; Miller, 2019), as they decompose predictions into clear, feature-specific contributions (McIntosh, 2025; Ibrahim et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024; Bouchiat et al., 2023). However, the strictly additive structure of GAMs can limit their ability to capture complex relationships among features, often resulting in suboptimal predictive performance. common approach to improve the predictive accuracy of GAMs is to incorporate feature interactions (Ruppert, 2004; Lou et al., 2013). However, introducing such interactions often diminishes interpretability, as it becomes more difficult to transparently attribute predictions to individual features, since interpreting single feature may require comprehensive analysis of multiple related feature interactions (Lou et al., 2012; Caruana et al., 2015; Christoph, 2020). Furthermore, GAMs with interactions typically lack explicit mechanisms to control model additivity, the degree to which outputs can be decomposed into additive feature contributions, which is hallmark of standard GAMs. This limitation restricts users ability to flexibly balance accuracy and interpretability to suit specific application requirements. In this work, we propose Neural Additive Experts (NAEs), novel framework designed to address this fundamental trade-off. NAEs extend the classical additive paradigm by associating each feature with set of specialized expert networks. dynamic gating Neural Additive Experts: Context-Gated Experts for Controllable Model Additivity mechanism adaptively integrates information across features, allowing the model to relax the rigid additive constraints when interactions are important. To control the balance between accuracy and interpretability, we introduce targeted regularization term that controls the variance among expert predictions, enabling smooth transition from purely additive model to one that captures nuanced feature interactions while maintaining clarity in feature attributions. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates how NAEs can recover complex data-generating processes that are inaccessible to standard GAMs, and provides insight into the role of regularization in balancing model flexibility and interpretability. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that NAEs achieve competitive accuracy with state-ofthe-art black-box models, while offering transparent, feature-level explanations. By providing principled mechanism to control the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy, NAEs offer practical solution for applications where both predictive performance and transparency are essential. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We introduce Neural Additive Experts (NAEs), novel framework that extends additive models with mixture-of-experts architecture and dynamic gating, enabling flexible integration of feature interactions while preserving interpretability. We propose targeted regularization techniques that allow users to control the variance among expert predictions, providing principled mechanism to balance model flexibility and transparency. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating how NAEs can recover complex data-generating processes that are inaccessible to standard GAMs, and clarify the role of regularization in managing the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. We empirically validate NAEs on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that our approach achieves competitive predictive performance with state-of-the-art black-box models while maintaining clear, feature-level explanations.with set of expert predictors and employing dynamic, context-aware gating mechanism. This architecture enables the model to capture complex, contextdependent feature effects while preserving the additive structure that supports interpretability. Figure 1 provides an overview of the NAE architecture."

Multi-agent LLM systems face fundamental limitations in achieving continuous self-improvement while maintaining safety alignment due to inherent statistical blind spots in isolated evolution.  					AI-generated summary 				 The emergence of multi-agent systems built from large language models (LLMs) offers a promising paradigm for scalable collective intelligence and self-evolution. Ideally, such systems would achieve continuous self-improvement in a fully closed loop while maintaining robust safety alignment--a combination we term the self-evolution trilemma. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment. Empirical and qualitative results from an open-ended agent community (Moltbook) and two closed self-evolving systems reveal phenomena that align with our theoretical prediction of inevitable safety erosion. We further propose several solution directions to alleviate the identified safety concern. Our work establishes a fundamental limit on the self-evolving AI societies and shifts the discourse from symptom-driven safety patches to a principled understanding of intrinsic dynamical risks, highlighting the need for external oversight or novel safety-preserving mechanisms.

On-policy distillation is extended through a generalized framework that introduces flexible reference models and reward scaling factors, demonstrating improved performance through reward extrapolation and reward correction techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 On-policy distillation (OPD), which aligns the student with the teacher's logit distribution on student-generated trajectories, has demonstrated strong empirical gains in improving student performance and often outperforms off-policy distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) paradigms. In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead. We hope our work offers new insights for future research on OPD.

A vision-language-action model enhanced with world model-based reinforcement learning demonstrates improved performance and long-horizon execution capabilities for robotic manipulation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-language-action (VLA) models that directly predict multi-step action chunks from current observations face inherent limitations due to constrained scene understanding and weak future anticipation capabilities. In contrast, video world models pre-trained on web-scale video corpora exhibit robust spatiotemporal reasoning and accurate future prediction, making them a natural foundation for enhancing VLA learning. Therefore, we propose GigaBrain-0.5M*, a VLA model trained via world model-based reinforcement learning. Built upon GigaBrain-0.5, which is pre-trained on over 10,000 hours of robotic manipulation data, whose intermediate version currently ranks first on the international RoboChallenge benchmark. GigaBrain-0.5M* further integrates world model-based reinforcement learning via RAMP (Reinforcement leArning via world Model-conditioned Policy) to enable robust cross-task adaptation. Empirical results demonstrate that RAMP achieves substantial performance gains over the RECAP baseline, yielding improvements of approximately 30\% on challenging tasks including Laundry Folding, Box Packing, and Espresso Preparation. Critically, GigaBrain-0.5M^* exhibits reliable long-horizon execution, consistently accomplishing complex manipulation tasks without failure as validated by real-world deployment videos on our https://gigabrain05m.github.io{project page}.

LawThinker is an autonomous legal research agent that uses an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy with a DeepVerifier module to ensure accurate and procedurally compliant legal reasoning through dynamic verification of intermediate steps.  					AI-generated summary 				 Legal reasoning requires not only correct outcomes but also procedurally compliant reasoning processes. However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability. The code is available at https://github.com/yxy-919/LawThinker-agent .

Asymmetric Group Relative Advantage Estimation addresses exploration and difficulty adaptation challenges in reinforcement learning with large language models by dynamically modulating exploration incentives and sample difficulty focus.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly GRPO, has become the standard for eliciting LLM reasoning. However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across both LLMs and MLLMs.

Budget-constrained tool-augmented agents use a hierarchical world model and intent-aware planning to optimize multi-step task completion under monetary constraints.  					AI-generated summary 				 We study budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, where a large language model must solve multi-step tasks by invoking external tools under a strict monetary budget. We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.

MolmoSpaces presents an open ecosystem with diverse indoor environments and annotated objects for large-scale robot policy benchmarking across multiple tasks and simulators.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deploying robots at scale demands robustness to the long tail of everyday situations. The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, ho = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion. Through MolmoSpaces and its open-source assets and tooling, we provide a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research.

Voxtral Realtime is a streaming speech recognition model trained end-to-end for sub-second latency with performance matching offline systems.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Voxtral Realtime, a natively streaming automatic speech recognition model that matches offline transcription quality at sub-second latency. Unlike approaches that adapt offline models through chunking or sliding windows, Voxtral Realtime is trained end-to-end for streaming, with explicit alignment between audio and text streams. Our architecture builds on the Delayed Streams Modeling framework, introducing a new causal audio encoder and Ada RMS-Norm for improved delay conditioning. We scale pretraining to a large-scale dataset spanning 13 languages. At a delay of 480ms, Voxtral Realtime achieves performance on par with Whisper, the most widely deployed offline transcription system. We release the model weights under the Apache 2.0 license.

Foundation models generate executable environment code to scaffold learning progress in open-ended worlds, enabling agents to acquire long-horizon skills through curriculum control.  					AI-generated summary 				 Open-ended learning frames intelligence as emerging from continual interaction with an ever-expanding space of environments. While recent advances have utilized foundation models to programmatically generate diverse environments, these approaches often focus on discovering isolated behaviors rather than orchestrating sustained progression. In complex open-ended worlds, the large combinatorial space of possible challenges makes it difficult for agents to discover sequences of experiences that remain consistently learnable. To address this, we propose Dreaming in Code (DiCode), a framework in which foundation models synthesize executable environment code to scaffold learning toward increasing competence. In DiCode, "dreaming" takes the form of materializing code-level variations of the world. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, a challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression. Empirically, DiCode enables agents to acquire long-horizon skills, achieving a 16% improvement in mean return over the strongest baseline and non-zero success on late-game combat tasks where prior methods fail. Our results suggest that code-level environment design provides a practical mechanism for curriculum control, enabling the construction of intermediate environments that bridge competence gaps in open-ended worlds.

We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, a challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression. Empirically, DiCode enables agents to acquire long-horizon skills, achieving a 16% improvement in mean return over the strongest baseline and non-zero success on late-game combat tasks where prior methods fail. Our results suggest that code-level environment design provides a practical mechanism for curriculum control, enabling the construction of intermediate environments that bridge competence gaps in open-ended worlds.

Diffusion large language models enable parallel token generation and efficient reasoning enhancement through a voting technique that identifies and refines uncertain predictions across multiple samples.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) represent a new paradigm beyond autoregressive modeling, offering competitive performance while naturally enabling a flexible decoding process. Specifically, dLLMs can generate tokens at arbitrary positions in parallel, endowing them with significant potential for parallel test-time scaling, which was previously constrained by severe inefficiency in autoregressive modeling. In this work, we introduce dVoting, a fast voting technique that boosts reasoning capability without training, with only an acceptable extra computational overhead. dVoting is motivated by the observation that, across multiple samples for the same prompt, token predictions remain largely consistent, whereas performance is determined by a small subset of tokens exhibiting cross-sample variability. Leveraging the arbitrary-position generation capability of dLLMs, dVoting performs iterative refinement by sampling, identifying uncertain tokens via consistency analysis, regenerating them through voting, and repeating this process until convergence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that dVoting consistently improves performance across various benchmarks. It achieves gains of 6.22%-7.66% on GSM8K, 4.40%-7.20% on MATH500, 3.16%-14.84% on ARC-C, and 4.83%-5.74% on MMLU. Our code is available at https://github.com/fscdc/dVoting

ThinkRouter is a confidence-aware routing mechanism that improves reasoning efficiency by switching between discrete token and latent spaces based on model confidence, achieving better accuracy and faster generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent work explores latent reasoning to improve reasoning efficiency by replacing explicit reasoning trajectories with continuous representations in a latent space, yet its effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

ScalSelect is a scalable training-free method for selecting representative multimodal data that achieves near-full-dataset performance with significantly reduced computational requirements.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large-scale Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) has become a key paradigm for advancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) across various multimodal tasks. However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings. The code is available at https://github.com/ChangtiWu/ScalSelect{ScalSelect}.

"ScalSelect is a scalable training-free method for selecting representative multimodal data that achieves near-full-dataset performance with significantly reduced computational requirements.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large-scale Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) has become a key paradigm for advancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) across various multimodal tasks. However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings. The code is available at https://github.com/ChangtiWu/ScalSelect{ScalSelect}."

Gaia2 presents a benchmark for evaluating large language model agents in asynchronous, dynamic environments with temporal constraints and multi-agent collaboration, featuring a write-action verifier for reinforcement learning and revealing trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, and robustness.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Gaia2, a benchmark for evaluating large language model agents in realistic, asynchronous environments. Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the "sim2real" gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source Agents Research Environments platform and designed to be easy to extend. By releasing Gaia2 alongside the foundational ARE framework, we aim to provide the community with a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training the next generation of practical agent systems.

MiniCPM-SALA combines sparse and linear attention mechanisms in a hybrid architecture to enable efficient processing of ultra-long contexts while maintaining model performance and reducing training costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 The evolution of large language models (LLMs) towards applications with ultra-long contexts faces challenges posed by the high computational and memory costs of the Transformer architecture. While existing sparse and linear attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate these issues, they typically involve a trade-off between memory efficiency and model performance. This paper introduces MiniCPM-SALA, a 9B-parameter hybrid architecture that integrates the high-fidelity long-context modeling of sparse attention (InfLLM-V2) with the global efficiency of linear attention (Lightning Attention). By employing a layer selection algorithm to integrate these mechanisms in a 1:3 ratio and utilizing a hybrid positional encoding (HyPE), the model maintains efficiency and performance for long-context tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective continual training framework that transforms pre-trained Transformer-based models into hybrid models, which reduces training costs by approximately 75% compared to training from scratch. Extensive experiments show that MiniCPM-SALA maintains general capabilities comparable to full-attention models while offering improved efficiency. On a single NVIDIA A6000D GPU, the model achieves up to 3.5x the inference speed of the full-attention model at the sequence length of 256K tokens and supports context lengths of up to 1M tokens, a scale where traditional full-attention 8B models fail because of memory constraints.

A unified Vision-Language-Action model with a hierarchical architecture combining semantic reasoning and continuous trajectory generation achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple embodied navigation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Embodied navigation has long been fragmented by task-specific architectures. We introduce ABot-N0, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation model that achieves a ``Grand Unification'' across 5 core tasks: Point-Goal, Object-Goal, Instruction-Following, POI-Goal, and Person-Following. ABot-N0 utilizes a hierarchical ``Brain-Action'' architecture, pairing an LLM-based Cognitive Brain for semantic reasoning with a Flow Matching-based Action Expert for precise, continuous trajectory generation.   To support large-scale learning, we developed the ABot-N0 Data Engine, curating 16.9M expert trajectories and 5.0M reasoning samples across 7,802 high-fidelity 3D scenes (10.7 km^2). ABot-N0 achieves new SOTA performance across 7 benchmarks, significantly outperforming specialized models. Furthermore, our Agentic Navigation System integrates a planner with hierarchical topological memory, enabling robust, long-horizon missions in dynamic real-world environments.

Neural Additive Experts combines multiple specialized networks with a dynamic gating mechanism to balance predictive accuracy and feature interpretability in machine learning models.  					AI-generated summary 				 The trade-off between interpretability and accuracy remains a core challenge in machine learning. Standard Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) offer clear feature attributions but are often constrained by their strictly additive nature, which can limit predictive performance. Introducing feature interactions can boost accuracy yet may obscure individual feature contributions. To address these issues, we propose Neural Additive Experts (NAEs), a novel framework that seamlessly balances interpretability and accuracy. NAEs employ a mixture of experts framework, learning multiple specialized networks per feature, while a dynamic gating mechanism integrates information across features, thereby relaxing rigid additive constraints. Furthermore, we propose targeted regularization techniques to mitigate variance among expert predictions, facilitating a smooth transition from an exclusively additive model to one that captures intricate feature interactions while maintaining clarity in feature attributions. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on synthetic data illustrate the model's flexibility, and extensive evaluations on real-world datasets confirm that NAEs achieve an optimal balance between predictive accuracy and transparent, feature-level explanations.
