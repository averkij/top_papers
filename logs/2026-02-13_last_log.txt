Robot teleoperation data collection is constrained to laboratory environment due to hardware and safety limitations, while inthe-wild human demonstrations offer scalable diversity in objects, scenes, lighting, and viewpoints. Our alignment pipeline bridges the embodiment gap through view and action alignment, enabling vision-language-action (VLA) co-training on both data sources. Real-world loco-manipulation deployment validates that egocentric human demonstrations invigorate generalization without scene-specific robot data, outperforming robot-only baselines by 51% with consistent scaling behavior. AbstractHuman demonstrations offer rich environmental diversity and scale naturally, making them an appealing alternative to robot teleoperation. While this paradigm has advanced robotarm manipulation, its potential for the more challenging, datahungry problem of humanoid loco-manipulation remains largely unexplored. We present EGOHUMANOID, the first framework to co-train vision-language-action policy using abundant egocentric human demonstrations together with limited amount of robot data, enabling humanoids to perform loco-manipulation across diverse real-world environments. To bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots, including discrepancies in physical morphology and viewpoint, we introduce systematic alignment pipeline spanning from hardware design to data processing. portable system for scalable human data collection is developed, and "

Text:"Sparse Video Generation Propels Real-World Beyond-the-View Vision-Language Navigation Hai Zhang* Siqi Liang* Li Chen Yuxian Li Yukuan Xu Yichao Zhong Fu Zhang Hongyang Li The University of Hong Kong https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/SparseVideoNav 6 2 0 2 5 ] . [ 1 7 2 8 5 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Fig. 1: In this work, we investigate the beyond-the-view navigation task in the real world, where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without step-by-step guidance. Traditional large language model-based methods suffer from short-horizon supervision, leading to short-sighted behaviors, e.g., unexpected turning and dead-end trapping. We address this challenge from new perspective, by introducing the video generation model to this field for the first time. The whole training pipeline is sparsified further for the sake of extended prediction horizon and computational efficiency. AbstractWhy must vision-language navigation be bound to detailed and verbose language instructions? While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and stepby-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on shorthorizon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training. In this work, we identify that video generation models inherently benefit from long-horizon supervision to align with language instructions, rendering them uniquely suitable for BVN tasks. Capitalizing on this insight, we propose introducing the video generation model into this field for the first time. Yet, the prohibitive latenc"

EgoHumanoid enables humanoid loco-manipulation through co-training vision-language-action policies using egocentric human demonstrations and limited robot data, addressing embodiment gaps via view and action alignment techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 Human demonstrations offer rich environmental diversity and scale naturally, making them an appealing alternative to robot teleoperation. While this paradigm has advanced robot-arm manipulation, its potential for the more challenging, data-hungry problem of humanoid loco-manipulation remains largely unexplored. We present EgoHumanoid, the first framework to co-train a vision-language-action policy using abundant egocentric human demonstrations together with a limited amount of robot data, enabling humanoids to perform loco-manipulation across diverse real-world environments. To bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots, including discrepancies in physical morphology and viewpoint, we introduce a systematic alignment pipeline spanning from hardware design to data processing. A portable system for scalable human data collection is developed, and we establish practical collection protocols to improve transferability. At the core of our human-to-humanoid alignment pipeline lies two key components. The view alignment reduces visual domain discrepancies caused by camera height and perspective variation. The action alignment maps human motions into a unified, kinematically feasible action space for humanoid control. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that incorporating robot-free egocentric data significantly outperforms robot-only baselines by 51\%, particularly in unseen environments. Our analysis further reveals which behaviors transfer effectively and the potential for scaling human data.

"EgoHumanoid enables humanoid loco-manipulation through co-training vision-language-action policies using egocentric human demonstrations and limited robot data, addressing embodiment gaps via view and action alignment techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 Human demonstrations offer rich environmental diversity and scale naturally, making them an appealing alternative to robot teleoperation. While this paradigm has advanced robot-arm manipulation, its potential for the more challenging, data-hungry problem of humanoid loco-manipulation remains largely unexplored. We present EgoHumanoid, the first framework to co-train a vision-language-action policy using abundant egocentric human demonstrations together with a limited amount of robot data, enabling humanoids to perform loco-manipulation across diverse real-world environments. To bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots, including discrepancies in physical morphology and viewpoint, we introduce a systematic alignment pipeline spanning from hardware design to data processing. A portable system for scalable human data collection is developed, and we establish practical collection protocols to improve transferability. At the core of our human-to-humanoid alignment pipeline lies two key components. The view alignment reduces visual domain discrepancies caused by camera height and perspective variation. The action alignment maps human motions into a unified, kinematically feasible action space for humanoid control. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that incorporating robot-free egocentric data significantly outperforms robot-only baselines by 51\%, particularly in unseen environments. Our analysis further reveals which behaviors transfer effectively and the potential for scaling human data."

Vision-language navigation systems traditionally require detailed instructions but can be improved by incorporating video generation models with sparse future planning for faster, more efficient real-world deployment.  					AI-generated summary 				 Why must vision-language navigation be bound to detailed and verbose language instructions? While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces a formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and step-by-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on short-horimzon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training. In this work, we identify that video generation models inherently benefit from long-horizon supervision to align with language instructions, rendering them uniquely suitable for BVN tasks. Capitalizing on this insight, we propose introducing the video generation model into this field for the first time. Yet, the prohibitive latency for generating videos spanning tens of seconds makes real-world deployment impractical. To bridge this gap, we propose SparseVideoNav, achieving sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon. This yields a remarkable 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart. Extensive real-world zero-shot experiments demonstrate that SparseVideoNav achieves 2.5x the success rate of state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks and marks the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes.

"General-purpose Vision-Language Models can be effectively adapted for e-commerce applications through targeted techniques that enhance product understanding while maintaining broad multimodal capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 E-commerce product understanding demands by nature, strong multimodal comprehension from text, images, and structured attributes. General-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable generalizable multimodal latent modelling, yet there is no documented, well-known strategy for adapting them to the attribute-centric, multi-image, and noisy nature of e-commerce data, without sacrificing general performance. In this work, we show through a large-scale experimental study, how targeted adaptation of general VLMs can substantially improve e-commerce performance while preserving broad multimodal capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel extensive evaluation suite covering deep product understanding, strict instruction following, and dynamic attribute extraction."
