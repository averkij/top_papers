Text:"TIC-VLA: Think-in-Control Vision-Language-Action Model for Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments Zhiyu Huang * 1 Yun Zhang * 1 Johnson Liu 1 Rui Song 1 Chen Tang 1 Jiaqi Ma 1 Abstract Robots in dynamic, human-centric environments must follow language instructions while maintaining real-time reactive control. Vision-languageaction (VLA) models offer promising framework, but they assume temporally aligned reasoning and control, despite semantic inference being inherently delayed relative to real-time action. We introduce Think-in-Control (TIC)-VLA, latency-aware framework that explicitly models delayed semantic reasoning during action generation. TIC-VLA defines delayed semanticcontrol interface that conditions action generation on delayed vision-language semantic states and explicit latency metadata, in addition to current observations, enabling policies to compensate for asynchronous reasoning. We further propose latency-consistent training pipeline that injects reasoning inference delays during imitation learning and online reinforcement learning, aligning training with asynchronous deployment. To support realistic evaluation, we present DynaNav, physics-accurate, photo-realistic simulation suite for language-guided navigation in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real robot show that TICVLA consistently outperforms prior VLA models while maintaining robust real-time control under multi-second reasoning latency.

Over the last decade, XAI has primarily focused on interpreting individual model predictions, producing post-hoc explanations that relate inputs to outputs under fixed decision structure. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman ρ = 0.86), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7 more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49%. These findings motivate shift towards trajectory-level e"

Vision-language-action models for robotics are enhanced with a latency-aware framework that compensates for delayed semantic reasoning during real-time action generation through delayed semantic-control interfaces and latency-consistent training.  					AI-generated summary 				 Robots in dynamic, human-centric environments must follow language instructions while maintaining real-time reactive control. Vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising framework, but they assume temporally aligned reasoning and control, despite semantic inference being inherently delayed relative to real-time action. We introduce Think-in-Control (TIC)-VLA, a latency-aware framework that explicitly models delayed semantic reasoning during action generation. TIC-VLA defines a delayed semantic-control interface that conditions action generation on delayed vision-language semantic states and explicit latency metadata, in addition to current observations, enabling policies to compensate for asynchronous reasoning. We further propose a latency-consistent training pipeline that injects reasoning inference delays during imitation learning and online reinforcement learning, aligning training with asynchronous deployment. To support realistic evaluation, we present DynaNav, a physics-accurate, photo-realistic simulation suite for language-guided navigation in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments in simulation and on a real robot show that TIC-VLA consistently outperforms prior VLA models while maintaining robust real-time control under multi-second reasoning latency.

Static and agentic explainability approaches differ in their ability to interpret model behavior, with attribution methods effective for individual predictions but inadequate for diagnosing failures in multi-step decision processes, where trace-based diagnostics prove more reliable.  					AI-generated summary 				 Over the last decade, explainable AI has primarily focused on interpreting individual model predictions, producing post-hoc explanations that relate inputs to outputs under a fixed decision structure. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman ρ= 0.86), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7times more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.

Авторы показывают, что методы атрибуции, эффективные для интерпретации отдельных предсказаний, неадекватны для диагностики сбоев в многошаговых процессах принятия решений. В качестве альтернативы они предлагают подход на основе анализа траекторий (trace-based diagnostics), который надежнее выявляет ошибки в поведении агентов. Исследование демонстрирует, что несогласованность отслеживания состояния в 2.7 раза более распространена в неудачных попытках и снижает вероятность успеха на 49%.",

"Static and agentic explainability approaches differ in their ability to interpret model behavior, with attribution methods effective for individual predictions but inadequate for diagnosing failures in multi-step decision processes, where trace-based diagnostics prove more reliable.  					AI-generated summary 				 Over the last decade, explainable AI has primarily focused on interpreting individual model predictions, producing post-hoc explanations that relate inputs to outputs under a fixed decision structure. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench).
