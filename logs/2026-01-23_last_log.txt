Our model generates 3D meshes in action from wide range of inputs such as text prompt, video, an image + an animation text prompt, or 3D mesh + an animation text prompt. Unlike previous approaches, our method is not only fast, but also rig-free and topology consistent. These properties are convenient in practice, e.g., they allow the seamless animation of complex 3D shapes like an octopus with maracas (top left) or the automatic transfer of the mesh texture throughout the animation (bottom right).

ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes by extending 3D diffusion models with a temporal axis, producing high-quality, rig-free animations from various input types while maintaining topological consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generating animated 3D objects is at the heart of many applications, yet most advanced works are typically difficult to apply in practice because of their limited setup, their long runtime, or their limited quality. We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes "in action" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed "temporal 3D diffusion". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting. We evaluate our model on standard video-to-4D benchmarks (Consistent4D, Objaverse) and report state-of-the-art performances on both geometric accuracy and temporal consistency, demonstrating that our model can deliver animated 3D meshes with unprecedented speed and quality.

Ключевая идея заключается в применении временной 3D-диффузии, где модель сначала генерирует последовательность синхронизированных латентных представлений деформирующихся форм. Затем специальный временной 3D-автоэнкодер преобразует независимые формы в деформации эталонной сетки, создавая связную анимацию. Метод работает быстро, без необходимости в скелетной анимации (rig-free), сохраняет топологическую согласованность и достигает лучших результатов на бенчмарках по геометрической точности и временной консистентности.",
