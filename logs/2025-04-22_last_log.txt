For such system to work in the wild, it must handle cluttered scenes that are crowded with people. As people move about, the model must keep track of who is who from frame to frame in order to produce coherent 3D motion estimate. This can be difficult as people occlude each other, pass behind objects, and step out of view. Maintaining accurate 3D pose estimates online is particularly challenging, as the model cannot leverage future context to fill in the gap for missing observation. Instead, the model must forecast to the best of its ability and snap to the correct state as soon as the person is visible again. Many existing approaches to pose tracking follow two-stage detect-and-associate paradigm (Insafutdinov et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2018; Doering et al., 2022; Rajasegaran et al., 2022). The idea is to run state-of-the-art pose estimation system for each frame, and then link poses across frames using cues such as proximity and appearance. As with many two-stage approaches, the second-stage pose estimates and tracks can be undermined by flaws in the first stage. If detection is missed in the first stage, some other mechanism must be introduced to update the pose. For example, one option is to fill in any missing poses offline using the context of the full track (Goel et al., 2023). However, this solution is not suitable for online applications that deal with live video. We present CoMotion, video-based approach that performs frame-to-frame pose updates in fundamentally different manner. Following the tracking by attention paradigm (Meinhardt et al., 2022), we do not link independent per-frame detections rather, we train recurrent model that maintains set of tracked 3D poses and updates them when new frame arrives. To update the poses, CoMotion directly ingests the pixels of the new frame. The model uses whatever image evidence is available to update the poses of all people in the scene simultaneously even those who may not be currently visible. One advantage of this approach is that CoMotion can learn to utilize subtle pixel 1 Published as conference paper at ICLR p o M n H 4 n i o a D Figure 1: CoMotion tracks 3D poses online from monocular RGB video. Rather than detect new poses in each frame and associate them to existing tracks, CoMotion updates tracks directly from incoming image features. As result, CoMotion keeps track of distinct individuals as they overlap in the camera frame (top) and occlude each other (bottom). Arrows highlight some points of interest. cues. pair of feet poking out may be insufficient to trigger an independent detection, but can still be quite informative if the model has been following that persons movement. Data is challenge with such video-based approach, for both training and evaluation. No dataset exists that provides ground-truth 3D poses of groups of people moving in diverse, cluttered realworld scenes. As result, it is rare to find video-based 3D multi-person pose methods that support in-the-wild videos with large numbers of people. Comparable methods evaluate tracking on limited settings with handful of people (Reddy et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2023). Only top-down methods report tracking results on more challenging real-world videos (Rajasegaran et al., 2022). We find that we can achieve excellent performance by training on heterogeneous mixture of datasets. Each dataset offers complementary form of supervision some are single-image, some are video, some are synthetic, and some provide partial ground truth. In particular, we leverage pseudo-labeling to supervise our system on challenging real-world video (Andriluka et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2022) that would be exceedingly difficult to annotate otherwise. We are unaware of any prior work in this area that trains on comparable heterogenous mix of datasets. In particular, there are no multi-person 3D pose methods that supervise temporally unrolled predictions on complex videos such as those provided by PoseTrack (Andriluka et al., 2018; Doering et al., 2022). We evaluate pose estimation performance and multi-person tracking using standard datasets for each task. CoMotion exhibits state-of-the-art pose estimation performance, while providing better and Published as conference paper at ICLR 2025 faster tracking with fewer temporal artifacts such as jitter and dropped poses. Figure 1 illustrates this combination of 3D pose estimation accuracy and tracking stability. On PoseTrack21 (Doering et al., 2022), CoMotion improves MOTA by 14% and IDF1 by 12% relative to the prior state of the art. At the same time, CoMotion is an order of magnitude faster than the prior state of the art.Many approaches to pose estimation and tracking have been explored. Some detect poses only in single image, some operate on video but only handle single person, and some track multiple people in video but dont estimate their poses."

We introduce an approach for detecting and tracking detailed 3D poses of multiple people from a single monocular camera stream. Our system maintains temporally coherent predictions in crowded scenes filled with difficult poses and occlusions. Our model performs both strong per-frame detection and a learned pose update to track people from frame to frame. Rather than match detections across time, poses are updated directly from a new input image, which enables online tracking through occlusion. We train on numerous image and video datasets leveraging pseudo-labeled annotations to produce a model that matches state-of-the-art systems in 3D pose estimation accuracy while being faster and more accurate in tracking multiple people through time.
