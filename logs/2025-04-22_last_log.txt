From rule-based automation to LLM-powered agents, mobile GUI automation has evolved significantly, yet still struggles with long-tail scenarios due to interface diversity. Our LearnAct framework introduces demonstrationbased learning to effectively handle these challenges, outperforming existing methods in both offline and online evaluations. ABSTRACT Mobile GUI agents show promise in automating tasks but face generalization challenges in diverse real-world scenarios. Traditional approaches using pre-training or fine-tuning with massive datasets struggle with the diversity of mobile applications and user-specific tasks. We propose enhancing mobile GUI agent capabilities through human demonstrations, focusing on improving performance in unseen scenarios rather than pursuing universal generalization through larger datasets. To realize this paradigm, we introduce LearnGUI, the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for studying demonstration-based learning in mobile GUI agents. It comprises 2,252 offline tasks and 101 online tasks with high-quality Equal Contribution, Project Lead, (cid:66) Corresponding Author. human demonstrations.

By curating LeetCode1 Python problems with rich metadata, broad coverage, 100+ test cases per problem, and temporal splits (pre/post July 2024), our dataset enables contamination-free evaluation and efficient supervised finetuning (SFT). Experiments show reasoning models significantly outperform nonreasoning counterparts, while SFT with only 2.6K model-generated solutions achieves performance comparable to 110K-sample counterparts. The dataset and evaluation framework are available on Hugging Face2 and Github3.Code generation is critical in research and applications of large language models (LLMs). With the emergence of advanced reasoning models like OpenAI o1 (OpenAI, 2024) and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a), two key challenges are highlighted. The first challenge is the lack of coding benchmarks that accurately assess LLMs reasoning abilities. LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2024), commonly used benchmark, addresses this by sourcing problems from platforms like LeetCode and AtCoder and using live updates to avoid data contamination. However, it has limitations: it covers few problems per platform and lacks detailed tags for algorithms and data structures, making in-depth analysis difficult. The second challenge is the absence of self-contained testbed for training LLMs to master competition-level coding through methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) (Zhou et al., 2024), direct preference optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023), and reinforcement learning (RL), Corresponding author 1https://leetcode.com/ 2https://huggingface.co/datasets/newfacade/LeetCodeDataset 3https://github.com/newfacade/LeetCodeDataset 1 which are widely used for aligning model behavior with desired coding performance (Shen & Zhang, 2024; Shen et al., 2025; Hu, 2025; Liu et al., 2025). While datasets such as APPS (Hendrycks et al., 2021), CodeContests (Li et al., 2022), and TACO (Li et al., 2023) provide competition problems split into training and test sets, they lack live updates and easy tools to support RL training workflows. Recently released Open-R1 CodeForces-CoTs (Penedo et al., 2025) dataset, generated by DeepSeek-R1, fails to filter solutions for correctness, limiting its reliability for rigorous skill evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce LeetCodeDataset, which fully leverages high-quality resources from LeetCode. LeetCode is popular online platform for coding practice and technical interview preparation. It offers over 3,000 algorithm and data structure problems at varying difficulty levels. The platform supports multiple languages (Python, Java, C++, etc.), providing real-time code testing with execution feedback. Developers use LeetCode to improve their problemsolving skills, prepare for tech company interviews, and join global programming competitions. We meticulously curated LeetCode dataset covering over 90% of Python problems on the platform. Each problem is annotated with rich metadataincluding difficulty levels, release dates, and topic tagsand paired with 100+ test cases of varying complexity to minimize false positives. The dataset also includes an evaluation toolkit for fast and reliable assessment. To ensure temporal validity, we adopted strict time-based split: problems released after July 1, 2024, form the test set for benchmarking, while those released earlier constitute the training set. Using this dataset, we evaluated popular modelsincluding proprietary and open-source modelsand reasoning and non-reasoning architectures. Our evaluation shows that reasoning models outperform non-reasoning ones in competitive programming tasks, with Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Anthropic, 2024) performing best in its category. Additionally, we conducted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) training on the LeetCode training set. Despite using only 2.6K samples, the resulting model achieves performance comparable to counterparts trained on 110K code examples, demonstrating the exceptional training efficiency of the LeetCodeDataset.2.1 Data Collection As of the end of March 2025, the LeetCode platform hosted approximately 3,505 programming problems, among which 3,115 supported Python submissions. Our data collection process begins with this Python problem set, and we describe our process below. Metadata Acquisition: LeetCode provides GraphQL API4 for accessing problem metadata and platform-hosted information. The following metadata fields were systematically collected for each problem: slug (URL identifier and primary key), question_id (unique sequential number), difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard), problem_description (full text, with examples and constraints, see Figure 1), starter_code (language template code), and topic_tags (problem tags such as Array, Dynamic Programming). Canonical Solution Verification: We retrieved reference solutions from various open-source GitHub repositories56, and then verified the correctness of these solutions on the LeetCode platform, establishing ground truth solutions with 100% acceptance rate. 4https://github.com/fspv/python-leetcode 5https://github.com/doocs/leetcode 6https://github.com/walkccc/LeetCode Figure 1: An example of LeetCode problem. Entry Point Identification: The entry point refers to the function targeted for testing. In Figure 1, this is missingNum. Most starter codes contain single function that is automatically identified as the entry point through text pattern matching. Specialized validation logic is necessary for problems requiring multiple functions (standard in design/simulation scenarios). However, such judgment codes are unavailable and challenging to develop. Therefore, our implementation focuses exclusively on single-function starter code scenarios. Input Generation: To generate inputs for the entry point as part of test case development, we use one-shot prompting (Figure 4) with the LLM. However, this method often produces ove"

Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) demonstrate that sophisticated behaviors such as multi-step reasoning and self-reflection can emerge via reinforcement learning (RL) with simple rule-based rewards. However, existing zero-RL approaches are inherently ``on-policy'', limiting learning to a model's own outputs and failing to acquire reasoning abilities beyond its initial capabilities. We introduce LUFFY (Learning to reason Under oFF-policY guidance), a framework that augments zero-RL with off-policy reasoning traces. LUFFY dynamically balances imitation and exploration by combining off-policy demonstrations with on-policy rollouts during training. Notably, we propose policy shaping via regularized importance sampling to avoid superficial and rigid imitation during mixed-policy training. Remarkably, LUFFY achieves an over +7.0 average gain across six math benchmarks and an advantage of over +6.2 points in out-of-distribution tasks. It also substantially surpasses imitation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT), particularly in generalization.

"Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) demonstrate that sophisticated behaviors such as multi-step reasoning and self-reflection can emerge via reinforcement learning (RL) with simple rule-based rewards. However, existing zero-RL approaches are inherently ``on-policy'', limiting learning to a model's own outputs and failing to acquire reasoning abilities beyond its initial capabilities. We introduce LUFFY (Learning to reason Under oFF-policY guidance), a framework that augments zero-RL with off-policy reasoning traces. LUFFY dynamically balances imitation and exploration by combining off-policy demonstrations with on-policy rollouts during training. Notably, we propose policy shaping via regularized importance sampling to avoid superficial and rigid imitation during mixed-policy training. Remarkably, LUFFY achieves an over +7.0 average gain across six math benchmarks and an advantage of over +6.2 points in out-of-distribution tasks. It also substantially surpasses imitation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT), particularly in generalization. Analysis shows LUFFY not only imitates effectively but also explores beyond demonstrations, offering a scalable path to train generalizable reasoning models with off-policy guidance."

Current Large Language Models (LLMs) often undergo supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to acquire tool use capabilities. However, SFT struggles to generalize to unfamiliar or complex tool use scenarios. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with R1-like models, have demonstrated promising reasoning and generalization abilities. Yet, reward design for tool use presents unique challenges: multiple tools may be invoked with diverse parameters, and coarse-grained reward signals, such as answer matching, fail to offer the finegrained feedback required for effective learning. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study on reward design for tool selection and application tasks within the RL paradigm. We systematically explore a wide range of reward strategies, analyzing their types, scales, granularity, and temporal dynamics. Building on these insights, we propose a principled reward design tailored for tool use tasks and apply it to train LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Empirical evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields robust, scalable, and stable training, achieving a 17% improvement over base models and a 15% gain over SFT models. These results highlight the critical role of thoughtful reward design in enhancing the tool use capabilities and generalization performance of LLMs. All the codes are released to facilitate future research.

Multi-turn interactions with language models (LMs) pose critical safety risks, as harmful intent can be strategically spread across exchanges. Yet, the vast majority of prior work has focused on single-turn safety, while adaptability and diversity remain among the key challenges of multi-turn red-teaming. To address these challenges, we present X-Teaming, a scalable framework that systematically explores how seemingly harmless interactions escalate into harmful outcomes and generates corresponding attack scenarios. X-Teaming employs collaborative agents for planning, attack optimization, and verification, achieving state-of-the-art multi-turn jailbreak effectiveness and diversity with success rates up to 98.1% across representative leading open-weight and closed-source models. In particular, X-Teaming achieves a 96.2% attack success rate against the latest Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which has been considered nearly immune to single-turn attacks. Building on X-Teaming, we introduce XGuard-Train, an open-source multi-turn safety training dataset that is 20x larger than the previous best resource, comprising 30K interactive jailbreaks, designed to enable robust multi-turn safety alignment for LMs. Our work offers essential tools and insights for mitigating sophisticated conversational attacks, advancing the multi-turn safety of LMs.

Mobile GUI agents show promise in automating tasks but face generalization challenges in diverse real-world scenarios. Traditional approaches using pre-training or fine-tuning with massive datasets struggle with the diversity of mobile applications and user-specific tasks. We propose enhancing mobile GUI agent capabilities through human demonstrations, focusing on improving performance in unseen scenarios rather than pursuing universal generalization through larger datasets. To realize this paradigm, we introduce LearnGUI, the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for studying demonstration-based learning in mobile GUI agents, comprising 2,252 offline tasks and 101 online tasks with high-quality human demonstrations. We further develop LearnAct, a sophisticated multi-agent framework that automatically extracts knowledge from demonstrations to enhance task completion. This framework integrates three specialized agents: DemoParser for knowledge extraction, KnowSeeker for relevant knowledge retrieval, and ActExecutor for demonstration-enhanced task execution. Our experimental results show significant performance gains in both offline and online evaluations. In offline assessments, a single demonstration improves model performance, increasing Gemini-1.5-Pro's accuracy from 19.3% to 51.7%. In online evaluations, our framework enhances UI-TARS-7B-SFT's task success rate from 18.1% to 32.8%. LearnAct framework and LearnGUI benchmark establish demonstration-based learning as a promising direction for more adaptable, personalized, and deployable mobile GUI agents.

We propose enhancing mobile GUI agent capabilities through human demonstrations, focusing on improving performance in unseen scenarios rather than pursuing universal generalization through larger datasets. To realize this paradigm, we introduce LearnGUI, the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for studying demonstration-based learning in mobile GUI agents, comprising 2,252 offline tasks and 101 online tasks with high-quality human demonstrations. We further develop LearnAct, a sophisticated multi-agent framework that automatically extracts knowledge from demonstrations to enhance task completion. This framework integrates three specialized agents: DemoParser for knowledge extraction, KnowSeeker for relevant knowledge retrieval, and ActExecutor for demonstration-enhanced task execution. Our experimental results show significant performance gains in both offline and online evaluations. In offline assessments, a single demonstration improves model performance, increasing Gemini-1.5-Pro's accuracy from 19.3% to 51.7%. In online evaluations, our framework enhances UI-TARS-7B-SFT's task success rate from 18.1% to 32.8%. LearnAct framework and LearnGUI benchmark establish demonstration-based learning as a promising direction for more adaptable, personalized, and deployable mobile GUI agents."

We introduce LeetCodeDataset, a high-quality benchmark for evaluating and training code-generation models, addressing two key challenges in LLM research: the lack of reasoning-focused coding benchmarks and self-contained training testbeds. By curating LeetCode Python problems with rich metadata, broad coverage, 100+ test cases per problem, and temporal splits (pre/post July 2024), our dataset enables contamination-free evaluation and efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Experiments show reasoning models significantly outperform non-reasoning counterparts, while SFT with only 2.6K model-generated solutions achieves performance comparable to 110K-sample counterparts. The dataset and evaluation framework are available on Hugging Face and Github.

Multi-view understanding, the ability to reconcile visual information across diverse viewpoints for effective navigation, manipulation, and 3D scene comprehension, is a fundamental challenge in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to be used as embodied agents. While recent MLLMs have shown impressive advances in high-level reasoning and planning, they frequently fall short when confronted with multi-view geometric consistency and cross-view correspondence. To comprehensively evaluate the challenges of MLLMs in multi-view scene reasoning, we propose All-Angles Bench, a benchmark of over 2,100 human carefully annotated multi-view question-answer pairs across 90 diverse real-world scenes. Our six tasks (counting, attribute identification, relative distance, relative direction, object manipulation, and camera pose estimation) specifically test model's geometric correspondence and the capacity to align information consistently across views. Our extensive experiments, benchmark on 27 representative MLLMs including Gemini-2.0-Flash, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o against human evaluators reveals a substantial performance gap, indicating that current MLLMs remain far from human-level proficiency. Through in-depth analysis, we show that MLLMs are particularly underperforming under two aspects: (1) cross-view correspondence for partially occluded views and (2) establishing the coarse camera poses. These findings highlight the necessity of domain-specific refinements or modules that embed stronger multi-view awareness. We believe that our All-Angles Bench offers valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between MLLMs and human-level multi-view understanding. The project and benchmark are publicly available at https://danielchyeh.github.io/All-Angles-Bench/.
