[ 1 1 7 2 5 1 . 4 0 5 2 : r 2025-4Eagle 2.5: Boosting Long-Context Post-Training for Frontier Vision-Language Models Guo Chen1*, Zhiqi Li1*, Shihao Wang2*, Jindong Jiang3*, Yicheng Liu1, Lidong Lu1, De-An Huang, Wonmin Byeon, Matthieu Le, Tuomas Rintamaki, Tyler Poon, Max Ehrlich, Tong Lu1, Limin Wang1, Bryan Catanzaro, Jan Kautz, Andrew Tao, Zhiding Yu, Guilin LiuWe introduce Eagle 2.5, family of frontier vision-language models (VLMs) for long-context multimodal learning. Our work addresses the challenges in long video comprehension and high-resolution image understanding, introducing generalist framework for both tasks. The proposed training framework incorporates Automatic Degrade Sampling and Image Area Preservation, two techniques that preserve contextual integrity and visual details. The framework also includes numerous efficiency optimizations in the pipeline for long-context data training. Finally, we propose Eagle-Video-110K, novel dataset that integrates both story-level and clip-level annotations, facilitating long-video understanding. Eagle 2.5 demonstrates substantial improvements on long-context multimodal benchmarks, providing robust solution to the limitations of existing VLMs. Notably, our best model Eagle 2.5-8B achieves 72.4% on Video-MME with 512 input frames, matching the results of top-tier commercial model such as GPT-4o and large-scale open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B. Links: Project Page 1. Introduction Despite the significant advances in multimodal learning Bai et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2023); Li et al. (2023,); Wang et al. (2024), many visionlanguage models (VLMs) remain focused on shortcontext tasks, with long-context understanding under-explored. This gap is particularly evident in both long video comprehension and highresolution image/video understanding, where the processing of extended visual contexts remains an open challenge. Such extended contexts encompass multiple images, extended video sequences, high-resolution media, or combinations thereof. However, the development of long-context VLMs is still in its early stages, hindered by fundamental challenges in dataset construction, architecture design, training strategies, and computation/memory bottlenecks. Figure 1: Performance comparison of Eagle 2.5 with leading vision-language models on the Video-MME benchmark. Eagle 2.5 demonstrates consistent improvement as the number of input frames increases. To enable long-context visual understanding, several approaches have been proposed to address the challenge of processing extended visual inputs by designing specialized compression or selection modules Jin et al. (2024); Korbar et al. (2024); Li et al. (2023,, 2024); Shen et al. (2024); Weng et al. (2024); Yu et al. (2024).

Eagle 2.5: Boosting Long-Context Post-Training for Frontier Vision-Language Models to extend the context length of VLMs, they often introduce additional computational overhead or capacity limitations, potentially constraining model performance. promising research direction is to extend the context length of LLMs to enable native long-context understanding. While prior studies Shen et al. (2025); Xue et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2024) have explored this direction, challenges and key limitations still remain. First, the performance of existing methods is often suboptimal, generally falling behind proprietary models. Second, these approaches struggle to achieve consistent improvements as the amount of visual input increases. Lastly, the optimal training strategies for state-of-the-art long-context VLMs remain unclear, given the complex interplay of factors such as training strategies and data recipes. To this end, we present Eagle 2.5, versatile multimodal model designed to efficiently process extensive contextual information. Unlike models solely optimized for handling long multimodal sequences without improving performance, Eagle-2.5 benefits from increased input length, leading to consistent performance gains besides merely accommodating longer inputs. As shown in Fig. 1, our model achieves superior context coverage and exhibits consistent performance scaling with increasing frame counts. Notably, it attains competitive results compared to larger models such as GPT-4o OpenAI (2023) and Qwen2.5-VL-72B Bai et al. (2025), while maintaining significantly smaller parameter footprint. Eagle 2.5 is driven by both the advanced training strategy and data recipe. For training strategy, we introduce two core components for effective long-context learning: information-first sampling and progressive training. Information-first sampling. The information-first sampling strategy ensures the preservation of essential visual and semantic information through two mechanisms: (1) Image Area Preservation, which optimizes tiling to retain the majority of the original image area while maintaining aspect ratio fidelity, avoiding rigid aspect ratio constraints; and (2) Automatic Degradation Sampling (ADS), which dynamically balances visual and textual inputs by prioritizing complete text retention while adaptively optimizing visual content to maximize context length utilization and preserve multimodal information. Progressive training. We employ progressive mixed post-training approach, wherein context length is incrementally expanded during training, enhancing the models ability to process inputs of varying sizes. This integrated strategy significantly improves information density over static sampling methods while ensuring consistent performance across diverse input types and lengths. For data recipe, we embrace the diversity first, then quality principle in curating the training data pool. Our data recipe combines open-source data (including human-annotated data as well as synthetic video data) with our self-curated Eagle-Video-110K dataset, specifically designed to enhance long video understanding capabilities. We adopt diversity-driven collection strategy, using multiple video sources and similarity thresholding method to identify novel clips that maximize content diversity. Our dataset is distinguished by its dual annotation approach: top"

We introduce Eagle 2.5, a family of frontier vision-language models (VLMs) for long-context multimodal learning. Our work addresses the challenges in long video comprehension and high-resolution image understanding, introducing a generalist framework for both tasks. The proposed training framework incorporates Automatic Degrade Sampling and Image Area Preservation, two techniques that preserve contextual integrity and visual details. The framework also includes numerous efficiency optimizations in the pipeline for long-context data training. Finally, we propose Eagle-Video-110K, a novel dataset that integrates both story-level and clip-level annotations, facilitating long-video understanding. Eagle 2.5 demonstrates substantial improvements on long-context multimodal benchmarks, providing a robust solution to the limitations of existing VLMs. Notably, our best model Eagle 2.5-8B achieves 72.4% on Video-MME with 512 input frames, matching the results of top-tier commercial model such as GPT-4o and large-scale open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B.

Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) uniformly perceive video frames, creating computational inefficiency for videos with inherently varying temporal information density. This paper present Quicksviewer, an LMM with new perceiving paradigm that partitions a video of nonuniform density into varying cubes using Gumbel Softmax, followed by a unified resampling for each cube to achieve efficient video understanding. This simple and intuitive approach dynamically compress video online based on its temporal density, significantly reducing spatiotemporal redundancy (overall 45times compression rate), while enabling efficient training with large receptive field. We train the model from a language backbone through three progressive stages, each incorporating lengthy videos on average of 420s/1fps thanks to the perceiving efficiency. With only 0.8M total video-text samples for training, our model outperforms the direct baseline employing a fixed partitioning strategy by a maximum of 8.72 in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness in performance. On Video-MME, Quicksviewer achieves SOTA under modest sequence lengths using just up to 5\% of tokens per frame required by baselines. With this paradigm, scaling up the number of input frames reveals a clear power law of the model capabilities. It is also empirically verified that the segments generated by the cubing network can help for analyzing continuous events in videos.
