Text:"9/28/25, 2:50 PM Who Invented Deep Residual Learning? . Jürgen Schmidhuber (28 Sep 2025) Pronounce: You_again Shmidhoobuh Technical Report IDSIA-09-25, IDSIA AI Blog @SchmidhuberAI juergen@idsia.ch Who invented deep residual learning? Modern AI is based on deep artificial neural networks (NNs).[DLH] As of 2025, the most cited scientific article of the 21st century is an NN paper on deep residual learning with residual connections.[MOST25,25b] Who invented this? Here is the timeline of the evolution of deep residual learning: 1991: recurrent residual connections (weight 1.0) solve the vanishing gradient problem 1997 LSTM: plain recurrent residual connections (weight 1.0) 1999 LSTM: gated recurrent residual connections (gates initially open: 1.0) 2005: unfolding LSTMfrom recurrent to feedforward residual NNs May 2015: very deep Highway Netgated feedforward residual connections (initially 1.0) Dec 2015: ResNetlike an open-gated Highway Net (or an unfolded 1997 LSTM) 1991: recurrent residual connections solve the vanishing gradient problem Sepp Hochreiter introduced residual connections for recurrent NNs (RNNs) in diploma thesis (June 1991)[VAN1] supervised by Jürgen Schmidhuber, at time when compute was about 10 million times more expensive than today (2025). His recurrent residual connection was mathematically derived from first principles to overcome the fundamental deep learning problem of vanishing or exploding gradients, first identified and analyzed in the very same thesis.[VAN1][DLP][DLH] https://people.idsia.ch/juergen/who-invented-residual-neural-networks.html 1/ 9/28/25, 2:50 PM Like most good things, the recurrent residual connection is very simple: neural unit with the identity activation function has connection to itself, and the weight of this connection is 1.0. Who Invented Deep Residual Learning? That is, at every time step of information processing, this unit just adds its current input to its previous activation value. So it's just an incremental inte"

MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification framework using diffusion models, effectively suppresses high-frequency adversarial perturbations while preserving low-frequency content, enhancing robust accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1 robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method.

Авторы обнаружили, что adversarial возмущения концентрируются в высокочастотных областях изображений с неоднородной интенсивностью. Вместо равномерного добавления шума, MANI-Pure применяет адаптивный частотно-ориентированный шум, подавляя возмущения в высоких частотах и сохраняя семантически важный низкочастотный контент. Метод достиг лучших результатов на RobustBench, улучшив robust accuracy на 2.15% при минимальной потере точности на чистых данных.",

"MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification framework using diffusion models, effectively suppresses high-frequency adversarial perturbations while preserving low-frequency content, enhancing robust accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the purification process.
