DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video diffusion model, improving efficiency by adapting it to deep compression latent space with lightweight fine-tuning. The framework builds on two key innovations: (i) Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with novel chunk-causal temporal design that achieves 32/64 spatial and 4 temporal compression while preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii) AE-Adapt-V, robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100 GPU. The accelerated models achieve up to 14.8 lower inference latency than their base counterparts without compromising quality, and further enable 21603840 video generation on single GPU. 5 2 0 2 9 ] .

Process-Supervised RL (PSRL) has emerged as more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL. However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency, both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size, ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To further improve sampling efficiency, we design one-step off-policy training pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

These priors allow latent visual capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with relatively small amount of multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priorsthe implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language pre-trainingare composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLMs latent visual reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively. This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, the perception prior emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction pipelinefrom LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal fine-tuningacross five model scales, wide range of data categories and mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups.

Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracymodels must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid hallucinations. This presents fundamental challenge for existing methods: approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we present TruthRL, general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using GRPO with simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models (e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as supervised fine-tuning or RL with binary reward, struggle to balance fa"

DC-VideoGen accelerates video generation by adapting pre-trained diffusion models to a deep compression latent space, reducing inference latency and enabling high-resolution video generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video diffusion model, improving efficiency by adapting it to a deep compression latent space with lightweight fine-tuning. The framework builds on two key innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii) AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100 GPU. The accelerated models achieve up to 14.8x lower inference latency than their base counterparts without compromising quality, and further enable 2160x3840 video generation on a single GPU. Code: https://github.com/dc-ai-projects/DC-VideoGen.

VitaBench is a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based agents in complex, real-world interactive tasks using a diverse set of tools and scenarios.  					AI-generated summary 				 As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios, existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools. Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator, enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical real-world applications.

dParallel is a method that enhances the parallel decoding of diffusion large language models, significantly reducing decoding steps without compromising performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable attention within the research community as a promising alternative to autoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower inference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel, a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/czg1225/dParallel

A novel PSRL framework (AttnRL) enhances exploration efficiency in reasoning models by branching from high attention positions and using an adaptive sampling strategy, outperforming prior methods in mathematical reasoning benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL (PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL. However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency, both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size, ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

LLMs develop visual priors during language pre-training, which can be leveraged for vision tasks with minimal additional data, and these priors are composed of separable perception and reasoning components.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone, surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively. This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

These priors allow latent visual capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively. This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs."

TruthRL, a reinforcement learning framework, enhances the truthfulness of large language models by balancing accuracy and abstention, significantly reducing hallucinations and improving performance across benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy -- models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods: approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models (e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness, underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing truthful LLMs.

Post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning lead to the emergence of specialized attention heads that support structured reasoning, with different training regimes affecting their evolution and performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore, we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses, we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off: strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations. More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design, emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

Dolphin, an efficient AVSS method, uses a dual-path lightweight video encoder and a lightweight encoder-decoder separator with global-local attention blocks to achieve high separation quality and significant computational efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Audio-visual speech separation (AVSS) methods leverage visual cues to extract target speech and have demonstrated strong separation quality in noisy acoustic environments. However, these methods usually involve a large number of parameters and require high computational cost, which is unacceptable in many applications where speech separation serves as only a preprocessing step for further speech processing. To address this issue, we propose an efficient AVSS method, named Dolphin. For visual feature extraction, we develop DP-LipCoder, a dual-path lightweight video encoder that transforms lip-motion into discrete audio-aligned semantic tokens. For audio separation, we construct a lightweight encoder-decoder separator, in which each layer incorporates a global-local attention (GLA) block to efficiently capture multi-scale dependencies. Experiments on three benchmark datasets showed that Dolphin not only surpassed the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model in separation quality but also achieved remarkable improvements in efficiency: over 50% fewer parameters, more than 2.4x reduction in MACs, and over 6x faster GPU inference speed. These results indicate that Dolphin offers a practical and deployable solution for high-performance AVSS in real-world scenarios. Our code and demo page are publicly available at http://cslikai.cn/Dolphin/.

"Dolphin, an efficient AVSS method, uses a dual-path lightweight video encoder and a lightweight encoder-decoder separator with global-local attention blocks to achieve high separation quality and significant computational efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Audio-visual speech separation (AVSS) methods leverage visual cues to extract target speech and have demonstrated strong separation quality in noisy acoustic environments. However, these methods usually involve a large number of parameters and require high computational cost, which is unacceptable in many applications where speech separation serves as only a preprocessing step for further speech processing. To address this issue, we propose an efficient AVSS method, named Dolphin. For visual feature extraction, we develop DP-LipCoder, a dual-path lightweight video encoder that transforms lip-motion into discrete audio-aligned semantic tokens. For audio separation, we construct a lightweight encoder-decoder separator, in which each layer incorporates a global-local attention (GLA) block to efficiently capture multi-scale dependencies. Experiments on three benchmark datasets showed that Dolphin not only surpassed the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model in separation quality but also achieved remarkable improvements in efficiency: over 50% fewer parameters, more than 2.4x reduction in MACs, and over 6x faster GPU inference speed. These results indicate that Dolphin offers a practical and deployable solution for high-performance AVSS in real-world scenarios. Our code and demo page are publicly available at http://cslikai.cn/Dolphin/."

VERA is a benchmark for evaluating reasoning ability in voice-interactive systems, revealing significant performance gaps compared to text models and highlighting challenges in real-time interaction.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Voice Evaluation of Reasoning Ability (VERA), a benchmark for evaluating reasoning ability in voice-interactive systems under real-time conversational constraints. VERA comprises 2,931 voice-native episodes derived from established text benchmarks and organized into five tracks (Math, Web, Science, Long-Context, Factual). Each item is adapted for speech interaction while preserving reasoning difficulty. VERA enables direct text-voice comparison within model families and supports analysis of how architectural choices affect reliability. We assess 12 contemporary voice systems alongside strong text baselines and observe large, consistent modality gaps: on competition mathematics a leading text model attains 74.8% accuracy while its voice counterpart reaches 6.1%; macro-averaged across tracks the best text models achieve 54.0% versus 11.3% for voice. Latency-accuracy analyses reveal a low-latency plateau, where fast voice systems cluster around ~10% accuracy, while approaching text performance requires sacrificing real-time interaction. Diagnostic experiments indicate that common mitigations are insufficient. Increasing "thinking time" yields negligible gains; a decoupled cascade that separates reasoning from narration improves accuracy but still falls well short of text and introduces characteristic grounding/consistency errors. Failure analyses further show distinct error signatures across native streaming, end-to-end, and cascade designs. VERA provides a reproducible testbed and targeted diagnostics for architectures that decouple thinking from speaking, offering a principled way to measure progress toward real-time voice assistants that are both fluent and reliably reasoned.

AI-generated summary 				 Developing autonomous agents that effectively interact with Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs) remains a challenging open problem, especially for small on-device models. In this paper, we present Ferret-UI Lite, a compact, end-to-end GUI agent that operates across diverse platforms, including mobile, web, and desktop. Utilizing techniques optimized for developing small models, we build our 3B Ferret-UI Lite agent through curating a diverse GUI data mixture from real and synthetic sources, strengthening inference-time performance through chain-of-thought reasoning and visual tool-use, and reinforcement learning with designed rewards. Ferret-UI Lite achieves competitive performance with other small-scale GUI agents. In GUI grounding, Ferret-UI Lite attains scores of 91.6%, 53.3%, and 61.2% on the ScreenSpot-V2, ScreenSpot-Pro, and OSWorld-G benchmarks, respectively.

Vision-Zero is a domain-agnostic framework that enhances vision-language models through self-improvement in competitive visual games, using Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization and achieving state-of-the-art performance without human annotation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1) Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets: CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization (Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering, and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based methods. Models and code has been released at https://github.com/wangqinsi1/Vision-Zero.

VisualOverload is a VQA benchmark that challenges models with simple vision tasks in densely populated scenes, revealing gaps in current VLMs' performance and offering insights into their failure modes.  					AI-generated summary 				 Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA) benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple, knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes. Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better models.

Theoretical analysis of reinforcement learning methods in enhancing LLM planning reveals that while RL improves generalization through exploration, policy gradient suffers from diversity collapse, whereas Q-learning maintains diversity and requires careful reward design.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction, focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in practice.

"Theoretical analysis of reinforcement learning methods in enhancing LLM planning reveals that while RL improves generalization through exploration, policy gradient suffers from diversity collapse, whereas Q-learning maintains diversity and requires careful reward design.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction, focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in practice."
