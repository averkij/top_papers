On the Detectability of LLM-Generated Judgments Dawei Li1, Zhen Tan1, Chengshuai Zhao1, Bohan Jiang1, Baixiang Huang2, Pingchuan Ma1, Abdullah Alnaibari1, Kai Shu2 and Huan Liu1 1Arizona State University, 2Emory University Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However, the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the interaction between judgment scores and candidate contentan aspect crucial for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce J-Detector, lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM judges biases with candidates properties for accurate detection. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of J-Detector and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges. Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in real-world scenarios. https://github.com/David-Li0406/Judgment-Detection https://huggingface.co/datasets/wjldw/JD-Bench (cid:128) https://llm-as-a-judge.github.io/ 1.

This gap raises critical question: can current models generalize to localized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but outsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding), benchmark of everyday Taiwanese soundmarks. TAU is built through pipeline combining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation, producing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by transcripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including Gemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates the need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more equitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the global mainstream. Index Terms culture understanding, localization, large audiolanguage model, benchmark 1. INTRODUCTION Understanding the sounds around us often depends more on what is heard than on what is said. Everyday acoustic cues carry cultural meaning that is independent of language. Metro chimes, scooter beepers, and convenience-store jingles are recognized by locals because of exposure, not because of words. Contemporary audio evaluation already includes environmental sound [1, 2]. However, strong performance on many benchmarks can be achieved by matching generic categories that appear worldwide and are heavily represented in web-scale sources, such as siren, dog bark, d"

Code: https://github.com/google-deepmind/regress-lm Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/akhauriyash/Code-Regression We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code executions, challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific feature engineering, we show that single unified Regression Language Model (RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, relatively small 300M parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains >0.9 Spearman-rank on competitive programming submissions from APPS, and single unified model achieves >0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet. Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms. 1.

However, existing MCP benchmarks remain narrow in scope: they focus on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows. To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, benchmark designed to evaluate MCP use in more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of 127 high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents. Each task begins with curated initial state and includes programmatic script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse interactions with the environment, involving broad range of create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of cutting-edge LLMs using minimal agent framework that operates in tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model, gpt-5-medium, reaches only 52.56% pass@1 and 33.86% pass^4, while other widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below 30% pass@1 and 15% pass^4. On average, LLMs require 16.2 execution turns and 17.4 tool calls per task, significantly surpassing those in previous MCP benchmarks and highlighting the stress-testing nature of MCPMark. mcpmark.ai eval-sys/mcpmark Figure 1: MCPMark evaluation pipeline with full state tracking. Each task begins from curated initial state with specific task instruction. The MCPMark-Agent then executes tool-calling loop, followed by programmatic verifier that evaluates whether all required checks are satisfied. 5 2 0 2 8 ] .

Examples include: Login with Cloudflare Turnstile in Playwright; CI/CD setup with ESLint in GitHub; weekend planner using tagged queries in Notion; schema design for project tracking in PostgreSQL; and contact extraction to CSV in Filesystem. All tasks show complex, multi-step workflows typical of real-world usage.The Model Context Protocol (MCP) (Anthropic, 2024) is standardized interface that connects large language models (LLMs) (Comanici et al., 2025; OpenAI, 2025c; Team, 2025) with external systems such as tools, APIs, databases, and contextual resources. By standardizing the way LLMs access and operate on these systems, MCP allows agents to function more effectively with eyes and hands in real environments, and many see it as foundational layer for AI in the agentic era (Hou et al., 2025). Despite growing use in practice, existing MCP benchmarks remain limited: tasks often involve shallow or read-heavy interactions (Liu et al., 2025; Yin et al., 2025; Mo et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2025), leading to narrow range of task patterns. As result, they fail to capture the complex, multi-step workflows typical of real-world usage. This makes it difficult to probe the performance boundariesespecially in assessing whether current models and agents possess the necessary capabilities, such as reasoning, planning, long-context processing, and tool use, to tackle realistic and demanding agent tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce MCPMark, benchmark designed to simulate realistic user scenarios within mirrored or isolated container environments, accompanied by reliable automated evaluation. Specifically, MCPMark spans five representative MCP environments: Notion, GitHub, Filesystem, PostgreSQL and Playwright. Figure 1 presents an overview of the evaluation pipeline, where each task comprises three components: task instruction, initial state, and programmatic verification script. Figure 2 provides examples of task instructions and initial states. For task creation, after selecting or designing an initial state, task instruction and verification script are developed through humanAI collaborative pipeline, where domain experts and language agents iteratively co-design and refine each task. After this pipeline, we apply expert cross-review and community-level validation to ensure clarity, realism, and quality. Compared to existing MCP benchmarks, MCPMark offers significantly broader coverage of create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations across diverse workflows. In total, MCPMark comprises total of 127 tasks and 38 unique initial states, with 20 to 30 tasks in each MCP environment. To fairly evaluate model performance on these tasks, we introduce MCPMark-Agent, minimal and general agent framework that executes models through standardized tool-calling loop. MCPMark-Agent integrates with variety of MCP servers and model providers, enabling"

[ 1 3 7 7 3 2 . 9 0 5 2 : r ABSTRACT Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering. Our code is available at https://github.com/utkarshxsahu/kgc.

AI-generated summary 				 We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility, dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making.

Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers.

"OceanGym is a benchmark for underwater embodied agents using Multi-modal Large Language Models to address challenges in perception, planning, and adaptability in harsh ocean environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility, dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are available at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym."

J-Detector, a neural detector with linguistic and LLM-enhanced features, effectively identifies LLM-generated judgments based on scores and candidate content, addressing biases and vulnerabilities in sensitive scenarios.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However, the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce J-Detector, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of J-Detector and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges. Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in real-world scenarios.

Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG) enhances multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and prompts without additional data or editing, outperforming existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt, IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c) formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter, seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

Operational safety, measured by OffTopicEval, is a critical issue for LLMs, with most models falling short, but prompt-based steering methods show promise in improving out-of-distribution refusal.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval, an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\% -- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based agents.

MotionRAG enhances video generation by integrating motion priors from reference videos using a retrieval-augmented framework, improving motion realism with negligible computational overhead.  					AI-generated summary 				 Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture; (iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of realistic motion dynamics.

TAU, a benchmark of culturally specific Taiwanese soundmarks, reveals that state-of-the-art large audio-language models underperform compared to local humans, highlighting the need for localized evaluations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large audio-language models are advancing rapidly, yet most evaluations emphasize speech or globally sourced sounds, overlooking culturally distinctive cues. This gap raises a critical question: can current models generalize to localized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but outsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding), a benchmark of everyday Taiwanese "soundmarks." TAU is built through a pipeline combining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation, producing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by transcripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including Gemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates the need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more equitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the global mainstream.

"TAU, a benchmark of culturally specific Taiwanese soundmarks, reveals that state-of-the-art large audio-language models underperform compared to local humans, highlighting the need for localized evaluations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large audio-language models are advancing rapidly, yet most evaluations emphasize speech or globally sourced sounds, overlooking culturally distinctive cues. This gap raises a critical question: can current models generalize to localized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but outsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding), a benchmark of everyday Taiwanese "soundmarks." TAU is built through a pipeline combining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation, producing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by transcripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including Gemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates the need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more equitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the global mainstream."

A unified Regression Language Model (RLM) predicts numeric outcomes of code executions, including memory footprint, latency, and neural network performance, across multiple languages and hardware platforms.  					AI-generated summary 				 We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model (RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet. Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

MCPMark is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MCP use in real-world workflows, featuring diverse tasks that require richer interactions with the environment, and reveals that current LLMs perform poorly on these tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 MCP standardizes how LLMs interact with external systems, forming the foundation for general agents. However, existing MCP benchmarks remain narrow in scope: they focus on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows. To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate MCP use in a more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of 127 high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents. Each task begins with a curated initial state and includes a programmatic script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse interactions with the environment, involving a broad range of create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of cutting-edge LLMs using a minimal agent framework that operates in a tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model, gpt-5-medium, reaches only 52.56\% pass@1 and 33.86\% pass^4, while other widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below 30\% pass@1 and 15\% pass^4. On average, LLMs require 16.2 execution turns and 17.4 tool calls per task, significantly surpassing those in previous MCP benchmarks and highlighting the stress-testing nature of MCPMark.

Graph Neural Network regression models estimate entity-level knowledgeability in Large Language Models to improve active labeling and multi-hop reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.

"Graph Neural Network regression models estimate entity-level knowledgeability in Large Language Models to improve active labeling and multi-hop reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering."

CritPt, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on research-level physics tasks, reveals significant gaps between current model capabilities and the demands of physics research.  					AI-generated summary 				 While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.
