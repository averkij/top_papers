Text:"5 2 0 2 5 ] . [ 1 2 0 4 5 0 . 2 1 5 2 : r Smart Timing for Mining: Deep Learning Framework for Bitcoin Hardware ROI prediction Sithumi Wickramasinghe , Bikramjit Das , Dorien Herremans Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore Abstract. Bitcoin mining hardware acquisition requires strategic timing due to volatile markets, rapid technological obsolescence, and protocoldriven revenue cycles. Despite minings evolution into capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new ApplicationSpecific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multiscale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa. These results indicate that MineROI-Net offers practical, data-driven tool for timing mining hardware acquisitions, potentially reducing financial risk in capital-intensive mining operations. The model is available through https://github.com/AMAAI-Lab/MineROI-Net. Keywords: Bitcoin Mining Deep Learning Decision Making Hardware acquisition DeFi. Bitcoin mining has become an industrial-scale activity requiring substantial investment in specialized hardware and energy infrastructure, where miners must str"

MineROI-Net, a Transformer-based model, predicts profitability for ASIC mining hardware acquisitions, enhancing decision-making in the volatile mining industry.  					AI-generated summary 				 Bitcoin mining hardware acquisition requires strategic timing due to volatile markets, rapid technological obsolescence, and protocol-driven revenue cycles. Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa. These results indicate that MineROI-Net offers a practical, data-driven tool for timing mining hardware acquisitions, potentially reducing financial risk in capital-intensive mining operations. The model is available through: https://github.com/AMAAI-Lab/MineROI-Net.
