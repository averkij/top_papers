Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We define this scaling as the interplay between the number of agents, coordination structure, model capability, and task properties. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench, spanning financial reasoning, web navigation, game planning, and workflow execution. Using five canonical agent architectures (Single-Agent System and four Multi-Agent Systems: Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid), instantiated across three LLM families, we perform controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations, standardizing tools, prompt structures, and token budgets to isolate architectural effects from implementation confounds. We derive predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated 𝑅2=0.513, enabling prediction on unseen task domains by modeling task properties rather than overfitting to specific dataset. We identify three dominant effects: (1) tool-coordination trade-off : under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multiagent overhead. (2) capability saturati"

Text:"GimbalDiffusion: Gravity-Aware Camera Control for Video Generation Frederic Fortier-Chouinard1,2, Yannick Hold-Geoffroy2, Valentin Deschaintre2, Matheus Gadelha2, Jean-Francois Lalonde1 1Universite Laval, 2Adobe https://lvsn.github.io/GimbalDiffusion 5 2 0 2 9 ] . [ 1 2 1 1 9 0 . 2 1 5 2 : r Figure 1. We propose GIMBALDIFFUSION, framework for absolute camera control in text-to-video generation. Our approach adapts foundational video generation models to accept absolute camera controls, conditioning the entire video on camera parameters expressed in gravity-aligned global coordinate system. This enables the generation of videos with challenging viewpoints, such as low pitch (top) or high roll (bottom), directly from text, something existing methods struggle to achieve. Refer to the supplementary material for the full videos. "

A quantitative framework for agent system scaling using empirical coordination metrics identifies optimal multi-agent strategies based on task properties.  					AI-generated summary 				 Agents, language model (LM)-based systems that are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting are becoming the dominant paradigm for real-world AI applications. Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, all multi-agent variants degraded performance by 39-70%. The framework predicts the optimal coordination strategy for 87% of held-out configurations, providing a predictive principle of agentic scaling based on measurable task properties.

GimbalDiffusion framework enables precise camera control in text-to-video generation using absolute coordinates and gravity as a reference, enhancing controllability and robustness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent progress in text-to-video generation has achieved remarkable realism, yet fine-grained control over camera motion and orientation remains elusive. Existing approaches typically encode camera trajectories through relative or ambiguous representations, limiting explicit geometric control. We introduce GimbalDiffusion, a framework that enables camera control grounded in physical-world coordinates, using gravity as a global reference. Instead of describing motion relative to previous frames, our method defines camera trajectories in an absolute coordinate system, allowing precise and interpretable control over camera parameters without requiring an initial reference frame. We leverage panoramic 360-degree videos to construct a wide variety of camera trajectories, well beyond the predominantly straight, forward-facing trajectories seen in conventional video data. To further enhance camera guidance, we introduce null-pitch conditioning, an annotation strategy that reduces the model's reliance on text content when conflicting with camera specifications (e.g., generating grass while the camera points towards the sky). Finally, we establish a benchmark for camera-aware video generation by rebalancing SpatialVID-HQ for comprehensive evaluation under wide camera pitch variation. Together, these contributions advance the controllability and robustness of text-to-video models, enabling precise, gravity-aligned camera manipulation within generative frameworks.
