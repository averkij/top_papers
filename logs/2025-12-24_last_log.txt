[ 1 3 7 6 9 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r aExisting reinforcement learning (RL) approaches treat large language models (LLMs) as single unified policy, overlooking their internal mechanisms. Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLamas prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training. By aligning training objective at lower layer, BuPO reconstructs foundational reasoning capabilities and achieves superior performance. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. *Equal contribution , Corresponding author 1Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences 2University of Chinese Academy of Sciences 3University of Electronic Science and Technology of China 4Tencent AI Lab.

Introduction Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as key driver in advancing the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Notably, the success of DeepSeek R1 (Guo et al., 2025) has solidified reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as potent post-training paradigm for enhancing LLM policies across diverse domains (Jaech et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025a; Team et al., 2025; Ouyang et al., 2022). To date, most existing RLVR research has predominantly focused on surface algorithmic Bottom-up Policy Optimization: Your Language Model Policy Secretly Contains Internal Policies design, such as reward construction (Shao et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025b;a; Liu et al., 2025b) and entropy regularization (Cui et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025b). Interpretability tools mitigate the opacity of black-box LLMs by unveiling their internal logic (Belrose et al., 2023; Tan et al., 2025a; Gupta et al., 2025). These insights establish feedback loop that is instrumental in guiding the refinement of RL algorithms. For instance, recent works leverage the interpretability tool of attention mechanisms to improve RL algorithm which show surprising effect (Li et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025a). However, they overlook the nature of the language model policy as well as the information latent in the models internal residual stream. The logit lens (nostalgebraist, 2020) framework offers initial insights by employing the unembedding matrix Eu to decode intermediate layer representations into the token space. This approach reveals that the internal residual stream harbors wealth of previously undiscovered information that evolves across layers and modules (Dai et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2025; Lindsey et al., 2025). Moreover, numerous studies have elucidated the mechanisms of self-attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs) and their impact on hidden states (Dai et al., 2022; Yu & Ananiadou, 2023; Jin et al., 2025). Collectively, these internal mechanisms with models offer new perspective for algorithmic optimizations. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of language model policies across layers and modules to facilitate optimization and unravel complex internal reasoning mechanisms. Our formulation is grounded in two key insights. First, the residual stream naturally supports additive decomposition (Zhang et al., 2025; Lindsey et al., 2025), allowing us to isolate the individual roles of each layer and module (Figure 1(a)). Second, we conclude that the samplable policy is intrinsic equivalent to the token distribution derived from the combination of hidden states with unembedding matrix Eu. Based on these, we construct the Internal Layer Policy πl Layer, which captures cumulative reasoning up to layer l, and the Internal Modular Policy πl FFN, which isolates the specific contributions of attention and FFN modules (Figure1(b)). This decomposition allows us to ask: How does internal reasoning evolve through the model? ATTN and πl Through systematic analysis of commonly used Qwen and Llama series (Meta AI, 2024; Yang et al., 2024; 2025a) based on Internal Policy Entropy in policy-centric view, we uncover both universal and critical architectural differences: (1) Consistent internal reasoning structure. All models exhibit universal reasoning structure: early layers maintain high entropy for exploring the solution space, while top layers converge to near-zero entropy for final prediction (Lindsey et al., 2025). (2) Distinct internal reasoning pattern. Despite the shared trend, the pace of convergence differs significantly. Llama exhibits sudden con2 vergence, where the prediction space collapses only with"

Text:"Step-DeepResearch Technical Report Agent-Team StepFun December 24, 2025 Abstract As Large Language Models (LLMs) shift toward autonomous agents, Deep Research has emerged as pivotal metric for assessing the core competitiveness of agents. However, existing works primarily focus on academic multi-hop search tasks with ground truth, such as BrowseComp, which often struggle to satisfy user demands for open-ended research tasks in real-world scenarios. Open-ended research not only demands robust retrieval capabilities but also challenges the agents comprehensive skills in latent intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, multi-turn tool use, logical structuring, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduce Step-DeepResearch, cost-effective, end-to-end deep research agent model. We propose novel Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities, aimed at reinforcing underlying capabilities in planning, information gathering, reflection, and report writing. In terms of the training paradigm, we construct progressive path from agentic mid-training to supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Combined with Checklist-style Judger reward design, this approach significantly improves robustness across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, to address the lack of evaluations reflecting real-world demands in the Chinese domain, we establish ADR-Bench, Chinese benchmark for realistic deep research scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that Step-DeepResearch, with only 32B parameters, achieves high score of 61.4% on the Scale AI Research Rubrics. In expert human evaluations on ADR-Bench, its Elo score significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models such as OpenAI DeepResearch and Gemini DeepResearch. These findings prove that through refined training scheme, medium-sized models can achieve expert-level deep research capabilities. With extremely low deployment and inference costs, Step-DeepResearch stands"

Despite substantial progress in recent years, existing separation models are either domain-specific, designed for fixed categories such as speech or music, or limited in controllability, supporting only single prompting modality such as text. In this work, we present SAM Audio, foundation model for general audio separation that unifies text, visual, and temporal span prompting within single framework. Built on diffusion transformer architecture, SAM Audio is trained with flow matching on large-scale audio data spanning speech, music, and general sounds, and can flexibly separate target sources described by language, visual masks, or temporal spans. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse suite of benchmarks, including general sound, speech, music, and musical instrument separation in both in-the-wild and professionally produced audios, substantially outperforming prior general-purpose and specialized systems. Furthermore, we introduce new real-world separation benchmark with human-labeled multimodal prompts and reference-free evaluation model that correlates strongly with human judgment.

Text:"QUANTIPHY: Quantitative Benchmark Evaluating Physical Reasoning Abilities of Vision-Language Models Li Puyin1,, Tiange Xiang1,, Ella Mao1,, Shirley Wei1, Xinye Chen1, Adnan Masood2 Li Fei-Fei1,, Ehsan Adeli1, 1Stanford University, 2UST *Equal First Authorship Equal Last Authorship Understanding the physical world is essential for generalist AI agents. However, it remains unclear whether state-ofthe-art vision perception models (e.g., large VLMs) can reason physical properties quantitatively. Existing evaluations are predominantly VQA-based and qualitative, offering limited insight into whether these models can infer the kinematic quantities of moving objects from video observations. To address this, we present QuantiPhy, the first benchmark designed to quantitatively measure VLMs physical reasoning ability. Comprising more than 3.3K videotext instances with numerical ground truth, QuantiPhy evaluates VLMs performance on estimating an objects size, velocity, and acceleration at given timestamp, using one of these properties as an input prior. The benchmark standardizes prompts and scoring to assess numerical accuracy, enabling fair comparisons across models. Our experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal consistent gap between their qualitative plausibility and actual numerical correctness. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key factors like background noise, counterfactual priors, and strategic prompting and find that state-of-the-art VLMs lean heavily on pre-trained world knowledge rather than faithfully using the provided visual and textual inputs as references when reasoning kinematic properties quantitatively. QuantiPhy offers the first rigorous, scalable testbed to move VLMs beyond mere verbal plausibility toward numerically grounded physical understanding.

SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy, evaluates and improves spatial abilities in MLLMs across multiple levels, revealing transfer dynamics and proposing an auto-think strategy for consistent performance enhancement.  					AI-generated summary 				 Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

"SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy, evaluates and improves spatial abilities in MLLMs across multiple levels, revealing transfer dynamics and proposing an auto-think strategy for consistent performance enhancement.  					AI-generated summary 				 Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs."

The paper decomposes the policy of large language models into internal layer and modular policies, revealing distinct reasoning patterns across layers and proposing Bottom-up Policy Optimization to enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches treat large language models (LLMs) as a single unified policy, overlooking their internal mechanisms. Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training. By aligning training objective at lower layer, BuPO reconstructs foundational reasoning capabilities and achieves superior performance. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/BuPO.

Step-DeepResearch, an end-to-end agent enhanced with a data synthesis strategy and progressive training, achieves expert-level capabilities in deep research scenarios, outperforming established models.  					AI-generated summary 				 As LLMs shift toward autonomous agents, Deep Research has emerged as a pivotal metric. However, existing academic benchmarks like BrowseComp often fail to meet real-world demands for open-ended research, which requires robust skills in intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduce Step-DeepResearch, a cost-effective, end-to-end agent. We propose a Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities to reinforce planning and report writing, combined with a progressive training path from agentic mid-training to SFT and RL. Enhanced by a Checklist-style Judger, this approach significantly improves robustness. Furthermore, to bridge the evaluation gap in the Chinese domain, we establish ADR-Bench for realistic deep research scenarios. Experimental results show that Step-DeepResearch (32B) scores 61.4% on Scale AI Research Rubrics. On ADR-Bench, it significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals SOTA closed-source models like OpenAI and Gemini DeepResearch.

SAM Audio, a diffusion transformer-based foundation model, achieves superior performance in general audio separation using unified text, visual, and temporal span prompts across various audio types.  					AI-generated summary 				 General audio source separation is a key capability for multimodal AI systems that can perceive and reason about sound. Despite substantial progress in recent years, existing separation models are either domain-specific, designed for fixed categories such as speech or music, or limited in controllability, supporting only a single prompting modality such as text. In this work, we present SAM Audio, a foundation model for general audio separation that unifies text, visual, and temporal span prompting within a single framework. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture, SAM Audio is trained with flow matching on large-scale audio data spanning speech, music, and general sounds, and can flexibly separate target sources described by language, visual masks, or temporal spans. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of benchmarks, including general sound, speech, music, and musical instrument separation in both in-the-wild and professionally produced audios, substantially outperforming prior general-purpose and specialized systems. Furthermore, we introduce a new real-world separation benchmark with human-labeled multimodal prompts and a reference-free evaluation model that correlates strongly with human judgment.

"SAM Audio, a diffusion transformer-based foundation model, achieves superior performance in general audio separation using unified text, visual, and temporal span prompts across various audio types.  					AI-generated summary 				 General audio source separation is a key capability for multimodal AI systems that can perceive and reason about sound. Despite substantial progress in recent years, existing separation models are either domain-specific, designed for fixed categories such as speech or music, or limited in controllability, supporting only a single prompting modality such as text. In this work, we present SAM Audio, a foundation model for general audio separation that unifies text, visual, and temporal span prompting within a single framework. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture, SAM Audio is trained with flow matching on large-scale audio data spanning speech, music, and general sounds, and can flexibly separate target sources described by language, visual masks, or temporal spans. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of benchmarks, including general sound, speech, music, and musical instrument separation in both in-the-wild and professionally produced audios, substantially outperforming prior general-purpose and specialized systems. Furthermore, we introduce a new real-world separation benchmark with human-labeled multimodal prompts and a reference-free evaluation model that correlates strongly with human judgment."

A novel RL framework, SAGE, enhances LLM-based agents' self-improvement capabilities by systematically incorporating skills from a skill library, leading to better performance and efficiency in new environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and multi-turn interactions but struggle to continuously improve and adapt when deployed in new environments. One promising approach is implementing skill libraries that allow agents to learn, validate, and apply new skills. However, current skill library approaches rely primarily on LLM prompting, making consistent skill library implementation challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on AppWorld demonstrate that SAGE, when applied to supervised-finetuned model with expert experience, achieves 8.9% higher Scenario Goal Completion while requiring 26% fewer interaction steps and generating 59% fewer tokens, substantially outperforming existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.

QuantiPhy is a benchmark that quantitatively assesses state-of-the-art vision perception models' ability to reason about physical properties such as size, velocity, and acceleration from video observations, revealing gaps between qualitative plausibility and numerical correctness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Understanding the physical world is essential for generalist AI agents. However, it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art vision perception models (e.g., large VLMs) can reason physical properties quantitatively. Existing evaluations are predominantly VQA-based and qualitative, offering limited insight into whether these models can infer the kinematic quantities of moving objects from video observations. To address this, we present QuantiPhy, the first benchmark designed to quantitatively measure a VLM's physical reasoning ability. Comprising more than 3.3K video-text instances with numerical ground truth, QuantiPhy evaluates a VLM's performance on estimating an object's size, velocity, and acceleration at a given timestamp, using one of these properties as an input prior. The benchmark standardizes prompts and scoring to assess numerical accuracy, enabling fair comparisons across models. Our experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent gap between their qualitative plausibility and actual numerical correctness. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key factors like background noise, counterfactual priors, and strategic prompting and find that state-of-the-art VLMs lean heavily on pre-trained world knowledge rather than faithfully using the provided visual and textual inputs as references when reasoning kinematic properties quantitatively. QuantiPhy offers the first rigorous, scalable testbed to move VLMs beyond mere verbal plausibility toward a numerically grounded physical understanding.
