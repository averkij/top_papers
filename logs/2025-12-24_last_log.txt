We present method for refocusing images using video diffusion models to predict focal stacks, allowing users to select their preferred focus. Trained on large smartphone dataset captured in diverse real-world environments, our model generates realistic defocus effects and performs effectively on real scenes. Focus is cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From single defocused image, our approach generates perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking range of downstream applications. We release large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography.

[24.12.2025 19:17] Claude request. Model: claude-haiku-4-5. Prompt: Read an abstract of the ML paper and return a JSON with fields: 'desc': explanation of the paper in Russian (4 sentences), use correct machine learning terms. 'emoji': emoji that will reflect the theme of an article somehow, only one emoji. 'title': a slogan of a main idea of the article in Russian. Return only JSON and nothing else.

Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography. Code and data are available at www.learn2refocus.github.io

Из одного размытого изображения их подход генерирует последовательность изображений с разными плоскостями фокуса (фокус-стек), представленную как видеоряд. Метод позволяет пользователям интерактивно выбирать нужную точку фокуса и применять различные эффекты размытия. Авторы создали большой датасет фокус-стеков, полученных в реальных условиях работы смартфонов, и показали превосходство своего подхода над существующими методами по качеству и надёжности.",
