Text:"BEDA: Belief Estimation as Probabilistic Constraints for Performing Strategic Dialogue Acts Zhaoxin Yu Institute of Automation, CAS Qi Shen School of Artificial Intelligence, BUPT Hengli Li Institute for Artificial Intelligence, PKU NLCo, BIGAI 5 2 0 2 1 3 ] . [ 1 5 8 8 4 2 . 2 1 5 2 : r Chenxi Li Department of Automation, THU Yipeng Kang NLCo, BIGAI Mengmeng Wang NLCo, BIGAI Yuxuan Wang NLCo, BIGAI Tinglang Wu Yuanpei College, PKU Song-Chun Zhu NLCo, BIGAI Institute for Artificial Intelligence, PKU Department of Automation, THU Zixia Jia NLCo, BIGAI Zilong Zheng NLCo, BIGAI ABSTRACT Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignmentand by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional KeeperBurglar (adversarial), Mutual Friends (cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.

Text:"Geometry-Aware Optimization for Respiratory Sound Classification: Enhancing Sensitivity with SAM-Optimized Audio Spectrogram Transformers Atakan Işı , Selin Vulga Işı , Ahmet Feridun Işı , Mahşuk Tayla2 1 3 nRespiratory sound classification is hindered by the limited size, high noise levels, and severe class imbalance of benchmark datasets like ICBHI 2017. While Transformer-based models offer powerful feature extraction capabilities, they are prone to overfitting and often converge to sharp minima in the loss landscape when trained on such constrained medical data. To address this, we introduce framework that enhances the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) using Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). Instead of merely minimizing the training loss, our approach optimizes the geometry of the loss surface, guiding the model toward flatter minima that generalize better to unseen patients. We also implement weighted sampling strategy to handle class imbalance effectively. Our method achieves state-of-the-art score of 68.10% on the ICBHI 2017 dataset, outperforming existing CNN and hybrid baselines. More importantly, it reaches sensitivity of 68.31%, crucial improvement for reliable clinical screening. Further analysis using t-SNE and attention maps confirms that the model learns robust, discriminative features rather than memorizing background noise. Keywords: Lung Sound Analysis, Audio Spectrogram Transformer, SAM, Imbalanced Learning, ICBHI 2017. INTRODUCTION Respiratory diseases remain leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating accurate and timely diagnosis for effective patient care. While modern imaging techniques like X-ray and CT scans provide detailed anatomical information, pulmonary auscultation retains its status as the most fundamental and accessible diagnostic method[1, 2]. In clinical practice, distinguishing conditions such as pneumonia from heart failure often relies on the subtle characteristics of breath sounds, even when radiological findings are ambiguous. the efficacy of auscultation is heavily dependent on the clinicians hearing sensitivity and However, experience[1]. Sound transmission through the thorax encounters complex biological barriers, including tracheobronchial cartilages and varying tissue densities. Consequently, factors such as muscular hypertrophy or obesity can dampen acoustic signals, making manual detection of pathological sounds specifically crackles and wheezes highly subjective and prone to inter observer variability. To standardize interpretation, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems using Deep Learning (DL) have emerged as powerful tool. Early approaches largely relied on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as ResNet or VGG, trained on spectrogram representations of lung sounds[3, 4]. While CNNs are effective at extracting local features, they often struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies that are crucial for distinguishing continuous respiratory cycles from transient artifacts. Recently, Transformer-based architectures, particularly the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), have demonstrated superior performance in audio tasks by leveraging self-attention mechanisms to model global context[5]. Despite their potential, applying Transformers to respiratory sound analysis presents significant engineering challenge. Benchmark datasets, such as the ICBHI 2017 Challenge dataset, are characterized by limited sample sizes, severe class imbalance, and high levels of background noise, including stethoscope friction, heartbeats, and speech[2]. Transformers, which typically lack the inductive bias of CNNs, require large amounts of data to generalize well. When trained on such constrained medical datasets, they are prone to overfitting and tend to converge to "sharp minima" in the loss landscape[6]. model residing in sharp minimum may perform well on training data but fails drastically when input data varies slightly, common occurrence in clinical settings due to different recording devices or patient physiology. framework that In this study, we bridge the gap between clinical acoustic complexity and deep learning robustness. We propose (AST) with Sharpness-Aware novel Minimization (SAM)[7]. Unlike standard optimization algorithms like SGD or Adam, which solely minimize the training loss value, SAM simultaneously minimizes the loss value and the sharpness of the loss landscape. This geometry-aware approach guides the model toward "flat minima," ensuring that the solution remains robust integrates the Audio Spectrogram Transformer even in the presence of noisy or perturbed inputs. By combining this optimization strategy with weighted sampling technique to handle class imbalance, our framework significantly improves diagnostic performance. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: We introduce robust respiratory sound classification framework that adapts the AST architecture to small and noisy medical datasets using Geometry-Aware Optimization (SAM). We demonstrate that optimizing for loss landscape flatness significantly mitigates overfitting in Transformer models, leading to new state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy of 68.10% on the ICBHI 2017 dataset. Our method achieves sensitivity of 68%, outperforming existing CNN and hybrid baselines[3, 8-10], which is critical for minimizing false negatives in clinical screening. We provide detailed visual analysis using t-SNE and confusion matrix.The automated analysis of respiratory sounds has witnessed paradigm shift from manual feature engineering to end-to-end deep learning architectures. This section critically reviews the evolution of these methods, focusing on CNN-based baselines, advanced augmentation strategies, and the recent surge of Transformer models."

A framework called BEDA uses probabilistic constraints on belief estimation to improve strategic dialogue through formalized adversarial and alignment acts, outperforming baselines across multiple task settings.  					AI-generated summary 				 Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.

Respiratory sound classification is hindered by the limited size, high noise levels, and severe class imbalance of benchmark datasets like ICBHI 2017. While Transformer-based models offer powerful feature extraction capabilities, they are prone to overfitting and often converge to sharp minima in the loss landscape when trained on such constrained medical data. To address this, we introduce a framework that enhances the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) using Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). Instead of merely minimizing the training loss, our approach optimizes the geometry of the loss surface, guiding the model toward flatter minima that generalize better to unseen patients. We also implement a weighted sampling strategy to handle class imbalance effectively. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art score of 68.10% on the ICBHI 2017 dataset, outperforming existing CNN and hybrid baselines. More importantly, it reaches a sensitivity of 68.31%, a crucial improvement for reliable clinical screening. Further analysis using t-SNE and attention maps confirms that the model learns robust, discriminative features rather than memorizing background noise.
