Text:"Youtu-LLM Technical Report Youtu-LLM: Unlocking the Native Agentic Potential for Lightweight Large Language Models Youtu-LLM Team We introduce Youtu-LLM, lightweight yet powerful language model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with native agentic intelligence. Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled "Commonsense-STEM-Agent" Curriculum We curated massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively.

Parameterperformance scaling of base and instruct models on agentic benchmarks. The trend line represents the desired agent performance with the smallest possible number of parameters, among which Youtu-LLM stands out as lightweight yet strong performer. 1 Youtu-LLM Technical Report Figure 2. Multi-field general capability comparison of similarly sized models. Youtu-LLM shows balanced and competitive profile, highlighting its general-purpose performance potential under limited parameter budgets.Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in recent years, steadily advancing toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) [Hendrycks et al., 2025]. By leveraging massive multi-domain corpora, growing parameter scales, and continuously evolving training paradigms, modern LLMs have demonstrated strong capabilities in reasoning, problem solving, and decision making [Guo et al., 2025, Yang et al., 2025]. Notably, recent reasoning-oriented models have achieved phenomenal performance on challenging agentic benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of large-scale training in eliciting complex cognitive behaviors [Plaat et al., 2025]. Despite these successes, current progress is tightly coupled with parameter scaling. State-of-the-art models typically rely on tens or hundreds of billions of parameters, incurring substantial computational, financial, and environmental costs during both training and deployment [Belcak et al., 2025]. These constraints significantly limit accessibility and real-world research and applicability, especially in latency-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. As result, there is renewed interest in developing lightweight large language models that retain strong general-purpose and reasoning capabilities while remaining practical for deployment. More well-known open-source model series are beginning to release models with fewer than 7B, and even fewer than 2B parameter models [Hu et al., 2024, Bakouch et al., 2025]. Existing approaches for improving small models largely rely on distillation, instruction tuning, or architectural simplification [Sharma and Mehta, 2025]. Although effective to some extent, these methods primarily align output behavior rather than systematically cultivating underlying cognitive capabilities. Consequently, lightweight models often lack robustness, generalization, and planning competence. Urgently, with the rapid emergence of complex tasks such as deep research, coding, and tool-augmented workflows, the above mentioned limitations of lightweight LLMs become even more pronounced in realworld agentic scenarios. The general consensus of the community indicates that effective agents require not only strong language understanding but also intrinsic capabilities for planning, tool execution, state perception, and feedback-driven reflection [Luo et al., 2025]. Therefore, recent work has begun exploring these native agentic capabilities in language models, shifting away from purely external agent frameworks 2 Youtu-LLM Technical Report toward internalized reasoning and interaction behaviors [Zeng et al., 2025]. In particular, trajectory-based training and continual pre-training on structured interaction data have shown promise in enhancing planning, reasoning, and tool-use abilities [Li et al., 2025]. Nevertheless, existing studies leave critical open question unanswered: Can lightweight LLMs acquire strong agentic capabilities through pre-training, rather than postaugmentation, such as post-training or agentic frameworks? In this work, we claim that strong agentic performance in lightweight LLMs is achievable when agentoriented signals are injected early and systematically through an agentic pre-training process. Specifically, we introduce Youtu-LLM, 2B-sized lightweight open-source model designed to balance compactness with robust general and agentic performance. Our approach integrates innovations in tokenizer design, data allocation, and multi-stage learning strategies under STEMand agent-centric training principle. Specifically, we propose series of scalable frameworks for constructing high-quality agentic trajectory data for pre-training. These frameworks cover broad range of capabilities, including reasoning, reflection, and planning, across diverse domains such as mathematics, coding, deep research, and general tool use. Through the proposed data pipeline, we obtain over 200B tokens of high-quality agentic trajectory data, providing fuel for ou"

Text:"5 2 0 2 0 3 ] . [ 1 0 1 2 4 2 . 2 1 5 2 : r GR-Dexter Technical ReportVision-language-action (VLA) models have enabled language-conditioned, long-horizon robot manipulation, but most existing systems are limited to grippers. Scaling VLA policies to bimanual robots with high degree-of-freedom (DoF) dexterous hands remains challenging due to the expanded action space, frequent hand-object occlusions, and the cost of collecting real-robot data. We present GR-Dexter, holistic hardware-model-data framework for VLA-based generalist manipulation on bimanual dexterous-hand robot. Our approach combines the design of compact 21-DoF robotic hand, an intuitive bimanual teleoperation system for real-robot data collection, and training recipe that leverages teleoperated robot trajectories together with large-scale visionlanguage and carefully curated cross-embodiment datasets. Across real-world evaluations spanning long-horizon everyday manipulation and generalizable pick-and-place, GR-Dexter achieves strong in-domain performance and improved robustness to unseen objects and unseen instructions. We hope GR-Dexter serves as practical step toward generalist dexterous-hand robotic manipulation. Date: January 1, 2026 Correspondence: wenruoshi@bytedance.com Project Page: https://byte-dexter.github.io/gr-dexterGeneralist manipulation policies powered by vision-language-action (VLA) models have enabled languageconditioned control and long-horizon instruction following in robot manipulation [12, 28, 45, 60]. However, most existing policies are deployed on bimanual robots with gripper-based end effectors. Extending these capabilities to robots equipped with dexterous hands remains underexplored. As robots move toward general-purpose operation in cluttered, human-centered environments, dexterous hands hold greater potential for achieving human-level manipulation. Yet this promise comes with substantial challenges: high degree-of-freedom (DoF) hands expand the control space by dozens of DoFs, while introducing perception difficultiesfrequent occlusions between fingers and between the hand and target objects. Moreover, as data-driven paradigm, VLA performance depends critically on the quality and diversity of robot trajectories for dexterous bimanual manipulation. We present the ByteDexter V2 handa 21-DoF linkage-driven anthropomorphic robotic hand, designed as self-contained, modular end-effector for dexterous manipulation, with space, complexity, and maintainability as key design constraints. Compared with ByteDexter V1 [61] and ILDA hand [29], V2 adds an additional thumb DoF while further reducing overall size. With actuators integrated within the palm, the hand achieves compact form factor (219 mm height, 108 mm width). It also incorporates high-density piezoresistive tactile sensors at the fingertips. 1 Figure 1 GR-Dexter performs dexterous long-horizon daily tasks and generalizes to out-of-domain settings by learning from four data sources: visionlanguage, cross-embodiment, human-trajectory, and robot-trajectory data. We then introduce VLA model GR-Dexter and training recipe tailored to 56-DoF bimanual system equipped with ByteDexter V2 hands. The policy is built on pre-trained VLM [4], and is co-trained on mixture of data sources, including teleoperated robot trajectories, vision-language data, cross-embodiment demonstrations, and human trajectories. Because bimanual arm teleoperation is challenging even with simple grippers, efficient demonstration collection becomes more difficult when each end-effector is 21-DoF dexterous hand. We address this challenge with teleoperation interface comprised of Meta Quest headset and Manus gloves, which retarget tracked human wrist poses and hand motions to joint position commands in real time. Beyond collecting teleoperated robot trajectories, anthropomorphic high-DoF hands also provide promising data-scaling path: the structural similarity between human and robot hands makes it feasible to directly leverage large-scale egocentric hand-object interaction datasets that cover diverse everyday dexterous behaviors [5, 21, 22, 24]. Our teleoperation pipeline then enables efficient collection of small amount of on-robot data for fine-tuning the pretrained models to adapt to the target platform. We evaluate GR-Dexter in real-world experiments across two task categories: (1) long-horizon manipulation, and (2) generalizable pick-and-place. Results show strong performance in both in-domain settings and challenging unseen scenarios, including novel objects and previously unseen language instructions  (Fig. 2)  . This performance stems from co-training with large-scale vision-language data, cross-embodiment data, and human trajectories, which preserves robust grasping behaviors on in-domain sub-tasks while improving generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Moreover, GR-Dexter successfully completes long-horizon everyday tasks, highlighting its practical bimanual dexterity in the real world. 2 (a) GR-Dexter performs long-horizon tasks. (b) GR-Dexter is capable of grasping unseen objects. (c) GR-Dexter follows unseen language instructions. Figure 2 Capabilities. GR-Dexter robustly completes long-horizon daily tasks.

We show the DoF distribution, tactile fingertips, and the thumbs opposition capability.The ByteDexter hand series employ linkage-driven transmission mechanism for its advantages in force transparency, durability, and ease of maintenance. As an upgraded successor to the V1 hand [61], the ByteDexter V2 hand introduces an additional thumb DoF, bringing the total to 21 DoFs, while simultaneously reducing the overall hand size (height: 219mm, width: 108mm). Each finger has four DoFs, and the thumb has five, providing wider range of oppositional motions, illustrated in Fig. 2. We also demonstrate its human-like grasping capability by executing all 33 Feix grasp types [18] (Appendix Fig. 9)."

Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also problem. In this paper, we first introduce Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages visionlanguage model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise PlackettLuce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Comprehensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on the PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2 datasets.

Prior approaches often rely on humandefined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level steps and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying c"

Yet the spirit of agentic crafting reaches beyond code, into broader tooland languagemediated workflows where models must plan, execute, and remain reliable under interaction. Reaching this new regime demands sustained, painstaking effort to build an agentic ecosystem as the foundational bedrock, ultimately culminating in an agent model as the capstone. ROME wasnt built in day. principled, end-to-end agentic ecosystem can streamline the development of the agent LLMs from training to production deployment, accelerating the broader transition into the agent era. However, the opensource community still lacks such an ecosystem, which has hindered both practical development and production adoption of agents. To this end, we introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), foundational infrastructure that optimizes the end-to-end production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three system components. ROLL is post-training framework for weight optimization. ROCK is sandbox environment manager that orchestrates environments for trajectory generation. iFlow CLI is an agent framework that enables configurable and efficient context engineering for environment interaction. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic ModEl), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. In addition, we curate suite of data composition protocols that synthesize data spanning isolated, static snippets to dynamic, complex agentic behaviors, with built-in verification of safety, security, and validity. We further develop an end-to-end training pipeline and propose novel policy optimization algorithm IPA, which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens, improving training stability over long horizons. Empirical evaluations show that ROME achieves strong results across mainstream agentic benchmarks, including 24.72% on Terminal-Bench 2.0 and 57.40% accuracy on SWE-bench Verified, outperforming similarly sized models and rivaling those with over 100B parameters. To enable more rigorous evaluation, we introduce Terminal Bench Pro, benchmark with improved scale, domain coverage, and contamination control. ROME still demonstrates competitive performance among open-source models of similar scale and has been successfully deployed in production, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of the ALE. 5 2 0 2 1 3 ] .

Early efforts largely cast LLMs as one-shot generators, emitting static responses to single prompt (Jiang et al., 2025; Allamanis et al., 2018; Hou et al., 2024). Yet this paradigm provides limited iterative reasoning and lacks grounded feedback loops, rendering it ill-suited for complex, end-to-end workflows. Accordingly, the frontier of LLM-based workflow-driven task (e.g., software engineering) is shifting toward the agentic crafting1 paradigm, which enables LLMs to plan, execute, and self-correct through multi-turn interactions with environments, spanning software repositories, terminals and broader tooland language-mediated workflows in the real world (Ning et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025e; Gao et al., 2023; Novikov et al., 2025).

Youtu-LLM is a lightweight language model optimized for computational efficiency and agentic intelligence through a compact architecture, STEM-focused training curriculum, and scalable mid-training strategies for planning and reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Youtu-LLM, a lightweight yet powerful language model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with native agentic intelligence. Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with a novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled "Commonsense-STEM-Agent" Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented a multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsic agentic capabilities.

GR-Dexter introduces a hardware-model-data framework for bimanual dexterous-hand robot manipulation using vision-language-action models, combining teleoperation data and multimodal datasets to achieve robust generalization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-language-action (VLA) models have enabled language-conditioned, long-horizon robot manipulation, but most existing systems are limited to grippers. Scaling VLA policies to bimanual robots with high degree-of-freedom (DoF) dexterous hands remains challenging due to the expanded action space, frequent hand-object occlusions, and the cost of collecting real-robot data. We present GR-Dexter, a holistic hardware-model-data framework for VLA-based generalist manipulation on a bimanual dexterous-hand robot. Our approach combines the design of a compact 21-DoF robotic hand, an intuitive bimanual teleoperation system for real-robot data collection, and a training recipe that leverages teleoperated robot trajectories together with large-scale vision-language and carefully curated cross-embodiment datasets. Across real-world evaluations spanning long-horizon everyday manipulation and generalizable pick-and-place, GR-Dexter achieves strong in-domain performance and improved robustness to unseen objects and unseen instructions. We hope GR-Dexter serves as a practical step toward generalist dexterous-hand robotic manipulation.

"GR-Dexter introduces a hardware-model-data framework for bimanual dexterous-hand robot manipulation using vision-language-action models, combining teleoperation data and multimodal datasets to achieve robust generalization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-language-action (VLA) models have enabled language-conditioned, long-horizon robot manipulation, but most existing systems are limited to grippers. Scaling VLA policies to bimanual robots with high degree-of-freedom (DoF) dexterous hands remains challenging due to the expanded action space, frequent hand-object occlusions, and the cost of collecting real-robot data. We present GR-Dexter, a holistic hardware-model-data framework for VLA-based generalist manipulation on a bimanual dexterous-hand robot. Our approach combines the design of a compact 21-DoF robotic hand, an intuitive bimanual teleoperation system for real-robot data collection, and a training recipe that leverages teleoperated robot trajectories together with large-scale vision-language and carefully curated cross-embodiment datasets. Across real-world evaluations spanning long-horizon everyday manipulation and generalizable pick-and-place, GR-Dexter achieves strong in-domain performance and improved robustness to unseen objects and unseen instructions. We hope GR-Dexter serves as a practical step toward generalist dexterous-hand robotic manipulation."

SpaceTimePilot is a video diffusion model enabling independent control of spatial viewpoint and temporal motion through a time-embedding mechanism, temporal-warping training, and a synthetic dataset for precise space-time disentanglement.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

High-stakes decision making involves reasoning under uncertainty about the future. In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.

An unsupervised framework using sparse auto-encoders identifies and controls interpretable reasoning behaviors in large language models through disentangled latent vectors.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite the growing reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), their internal mechanisms during the reasoning process remain underexplored. Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space. These findings underscore the potential of unsupervised latent discovery for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs.

The Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE) introduces a principled infrastructure for agent development, combining post-training optimization, sandbox environments, and policy alignment to enhance long-horizon training stability and performance in real-world tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.

"The Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE) introduces a principled infrastructure for agent development, combining post-training optimization, sandbox environments, and policy alignment to enhance long-horizon training stability and performance in real-world tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure."

Complex reasoning problems often involve implicit spatial, geometric, and structural relationships that are not explicitly encoded in text. While recent reasoning models have achieved strong performance across many domains, purely text-based reasoning struggles to represent global structural constraints in complex settings. In this paper, we introduce FIGR, which integrates active visual thinking into multi-turn reasoning via end-to-end reinforcement learning. FIGR externalizes intermediate structural hypotheses by constructing visual representations during problem solving. By adaptively regulating when and how visual reasoning should be invoked, FIGR enables more stable and coherent reasoning over global structural properties that are difficult to capture from text alone. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FIGR outperforms strong text-only chain-of-thought baselines. In particular, FIGR improves the base model by 13.12% on AIME 2025 and 11.00% on BeyondAIME, highlighting the effectiveness of figure-guided multimodal reasoning in enhancing the stability and reliability of complex reasoning.

We present PFP, a neural network structure to compress long videos into short contexts, with an explicit pretraining objective to preserve the high-frequency details of single frames at arbitrary temporal positions. The baseline model can compress a 20-second video into a context at about 5k length, where random frames can be retrieved with perceptually preserved appearances. Such pretrained models can be directly fine-tuned as memory encoders for autoregressive video models, enabling long history memory with low context cost and relatively low fidelity loss. We evaluate the framework with ablative settings and discuss the trade-offs of possible neural architecture designs.
