(Bottom) Qualitative comparison with existing methods, including 3DGS [28], FSGS [117], Difix3D [81], and GuidedVD-3DGS [114]. Previous approaches suffer from holes, ghosting, or inconsistent geometry when trained with sparse inputs. In contrast, our method effectively mitigates these artifacts and achieves superior image quality.Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and priorbased techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometryaware Multi-view Outpainter), framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which 1 inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multiview conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-theart reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving 25 speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes. Project page: https://yichuanh.github.io/GaMO/ 1. Introduction Reconstructing complete 3D scenes from limited input views is fundamental problem with numerous tangible applications, ranging from virtual property tours to immersive telepresence. However, it remains notoriously difficult, often resulting in broken geometry and visible visual artifacts. Previous approaches attempted to address the sparsity of input views through regularization, semantic priors, or geometric constraints [22, 33, 54, 71, 97, 117]. These methods remain limited in handling unobserved regions. Recently, diffusion-based approaches [1, 81, 83, 85, 114] have generated novel views to improve the reconstruction quality for sparse observations. Nevertheless, these methods show three fundamental limitations: (1) novel view generation mainly focuses on enhancing angular coverage of existing geometry and often overlooks the extension beyond the periphery, leaving persistent holes and ghostings in the reconstruction; (2) geometric and photometric inconsistencies across novel and input views inevitably become prominent as view overlap increases due to internal diffusion variations; (3) novel view generation requires elaborate trajectory planning and camera pose sampling, making the process time-consuming. Fig. 2 shows that when using multi-view diffusion models [3], adding more diffusion-generated novel views degrades reconstruction quality, suggesting that sparse views alone can yield robust results. Increasing the number of novel views from 3 to 11 counterintuitively worsens both geometric accuracy (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS) by introducing inconsistencies and artifacts into the reconstructed scene. We observe that outpainting, rather than novel view generation, offers more suitable paradigm for enhancing sparseview 3D reconstruction. By generating missing content around existing input views, outpainting naturally preserves geometric consistency and avoids multi-view alignment challenges. We propose GaMO (Geometry-aware Multiview Outpainting) to address the aforementioned limitations: (1) it expands the field of view(FOV) to cover unobserved regions, reducing holes and edge blur; (2) it utilizes existing viewpoints for content expansion rather than fusing information Figure 2. Motivation: Outpainting vs. novel view generation. Using multi-view diffusion [3], we train 3DGS [28] with three strategies: interpolated novel views (green), 3-view baseline (blue), and outpainting (orange). Top: Visual comparison shows interpolating additional novel views (311 total) introduces inconsistencies and artifacts. Bottom: Quantitative metrics (SSIM, LPIPS) show that adding novel views degrades quality due to inconsistencies, while outpainting consistently improves both geometric and perceptual quality. from multiple novel views in 3D space, preventing misalignment and ghosting artifacts; and (3) it completes reconstruction efficiently in single outpainting pass without complex trajectory planning, achieving 25 speedup over video diffusion-based methods. Following [114, 115], we evaluate on Replica [63] and ScanNet++ [102] with improvements across all metrics. We summarize our contributions as follows: We establish outpainting as superior paradigm for sparseview reconstruction, eliminating common issues including holes, ghosting artifacts, and geometric inconsistencies. We develop geometry-aware outpainting approach with novel conditioning and denoising strategies in zero-shot manner without finetuning. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on Replica and ScanNet++ across 3, 6, and 9 input views, with substantial gains in geometric accuracy and perceptual quality, while reducing reconstruction time to under 10 minutes. 2. Related Work Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS [28] achieves remarkable quality with dense inputs, sparseview reconstruction remains challenging, particularly for indoor scenes [34]. Recent methods employ depth regularization [10, 33], proximity-guided unpooling [117], dualfield co-regularization [110], and robust handling "

Recent research on autonomous agents has increasingly focused on designing efficient memory workflows by drawing on cognitive neuroscience. However, constrained by interdisciplinary barriers, existing works struggle to assimilate the essence of human memory mechanisms. To bridge this gap, this survey systematically synthesizes interdisciplinary knowledge of memory, connecting insights from cognitive neuroscience with LLM-driven agents. Specifically, we first elucidate the definition and function of memory along progressive trajectory from cognitive neuroscience through LLMs to agents. We then provide comparative analysis of memory taxonomy, storage mechanisms, and the complete management lifecycle from both biological and artificial perspectives. Subsequently, we review the mainstream benchmarks for evaluating agent memory. Additionally, we explore memory security from dual perspectives of attack and defense. Finally, we envision future research directions, with focus on multimodal memory systems and skill acquisition.

GaMO enhances sparse-view 3D reconstruction by using geometry-aware multi-view outpainting to improve scene coverage and consistency, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational cost.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a 25times speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

Memory serves as the pivotal nexus bridging past and future, providing both humans and AI systems with invaluable concepts and experience to navigate complex tasks. Recent research on autonomous agents has increasingly focused on designing efficient memory workflows by drawing on cognitive neuroscience. However, constrained by interdisciplinary barriers, existing works struggle to assimilate the essence of human memory mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we systematically synthesizes interdisciplinary knowledge of memory, connecting insights from cognitive neuroscience with LLM-driven agents. Specifically, we first elucidate the definition and function of memory along a progressive trajectory from cognitive neuroscience through LLMs to agents. We then provide a comparative analysis of memory taxonomy, storage mechanisms, and the complete management lifecycle from both biological and artificial perspectives. Subsequently, we review the mainstream benchmarks for evaluating agent memory. Additionally, we explore memory security from dual perspectives of attack and defense. Finally, we envision future research directions, with a focus on multimodal memory systems and skill acquisition.
