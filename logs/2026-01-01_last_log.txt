[ 1 6 0 2 2 2 . 2 1 5 2 : r CosineGate: Semantic Dynamic Routing via Cosine Incompatibility in Residual Networks Yogeswar Reddy Thota yogeswarreddy.thota@utdallas.edu Abstract Modern deep residual networks perform substantial redundant computation by evaluating all residual blocks for every input, even when identity mappings suffice. We introduce CosineGate, an end-to-end differentiable architecture for dynamic routing in residual networks that uses cosine incompatibility between identity and residual feature representations as self-supervised skip signal. CosineGate measures semantic redundancy through the Cosine Incompatibility Ratio (CIR), defined as 1 cos(x, (x)), and uses Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to enable persample, per-block gating during training. progressive FLOPs regularization term controls average compute usage without destabilizing optimization. On CIFAR-10, CosineGate systematically spans the accuracyefficiency Pareto frontier: an aggressive configuration achieves 89.9% accuracy with 24.1% FLOPs savings, balanced configuration achieves 91.3% accuracy with 28.5% savings at epoch 160, and conservative configuration reaches peak of 93.2% accuracy with minimal compute reduction. These results match or exceed ResNet-20 (91.3%) while reducing computation, without auxiliary supervision, distillation, or task-specific heuristics. Our results demonstrate that simple geometric measures of feature incompatibility provide principled and effective signal for dynamic residual routing. Residual networks (ResNets) [1] form the backbone of modern deep learning systems due to their ability to train deep architectures using identity shortcut connections. Each residual block computes = + (x; ), (1) where denotes the block input and (x) represents learned residual transformation. This formulation stabilizes optimization by enabling gradient flow through identity paths and guarantees that the trivial solution (x) = 0 always exists. However, this architectur"
