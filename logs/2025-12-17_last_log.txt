[ 1 1 5 0 4 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r OpenDataArena: Fair and Open Arena for Benchmarking Post-Training Dataset Value OpenDataArena Team1 1Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, OpenDataLab The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is predicated on the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. However, critical dichotomy persists: while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data fueling them remains black boxcharacterized by opaque composition, uncertain provenance, and lack of systematic evaluation. This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) unified trainingevaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODAcovering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data pointsreveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets. We release all results, tools, and configurations to democratize access to high-quality data evaluation. Rather than merely expanding leaderboard, ODA envisions shift from trial-and-error data curation to principled science of Data-Centric AI, paving the way for rigorous "

Medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to recover highquality medical images from their low-quality counterparts. Recent advancements in MedIR have focused on All-in-One models capable of simultaneously addressing multiple different MedIR tasks. However, due to significant differences in both modality and degradation types, using shared model for these diverse tasks requires careful consideration of two critical inter-task relationships: task interference, which occurs when conflicting gradient update directions arise across tasks on the same parameter, and task imbalance, which refers to uneven optimization caused by varying learning difficulties inherent to each task. To address these challenges, we propose task-adaptive Transformer (TAT), novel framework that dynamically adapts to different tasks through two key innovations. First, task-adaptive weight generation strategy is introduced to mitigate task interference by generating task-specific weight parameters for each task, thereby eliminating potential gradient conflicts on shared weight parameters. Second, task-adaptive loss balancing strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust loss weights based on task-specific learning difficulties, preventing task domination or undertraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed TAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedI"

This sparse labelset is then propagated using Sparse-To-Dense Distillation, aided by Temporal DropLoss. Finally, we train our model on the resulting dense labelset and demonstrate state-of-the-art results.In recent years, the state-of-the-art in unsupervised video instance segmentation has heavily relied on synthetic video data, generated from object-centric image datasets such as ImageNet. However, video synthesis by artificially shifting and scaling image instance masks fails to accurately model realistic motion in videos, such as perspective changes, movement by parts of one or multiple instances, or camera motion. To tackle this issue, we propose an unsupervised video instance segmentation model trained exclusively on real video data. We start from unsupervised instance segmentation masks on individual video frames. However, these single-frame segmentations exhibit temporal noise and their quality varies through the video. Therefore, we establish temporal coherence by identifying high-quality keymasks in the video by leveraging deep motion priors. The sparse keymask pseudo-annotations are then used to train segmentation model for implicit mask propagation, for which we propose Sparse-To-Dense Distillation approach aided by Temporal DropLoss. After training the final model on the resulting dense labelset, our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art across various benchmarks. Project Page: leonsick.github.io/s2d 1. Introduction Video instance segmentation is key task in perceptive computer vision, empowering range of applications, such as autonomous driving, AR/VR applications, and video editing. Compared to image instance segmentation, video instance segmentation though is fundamentally more challenging. To segment videos, models must learn temporal dynamics and maintain identity-preserving masks, while instances may appear, disappear and undergo occlusions. In recent years, range of supervised Video Instance Segmentation models have advanced rapidly [4, 34, 36, 41, 43], steadily increasing segmentation accuracy. However, many of these models rely on per-frame human annotations, which require immense annotation efforts and thus result 1 in high costs. For example, the largest video segmentation dataset yet, SA-V [23], contains 190K manual annotations, for which the authors employed large group of crowdworkers. Such costly efforts have sparked the field of Unsupervised Video Instance Segmentation. This research area follows the same core motivation as unsupervised image segmentation: Enabling segmentation without task-specific or any other human annotations, therefore removing entirely the need for human labeling anywhere in the pipeline [1, 10, 11, 25, 26, 32, 33]. Wang et al. [33] have proposed VideoCutLER, video segmenter trained on synthesized sequences of shifting instances through object-centric images from ImageNet [7]. Critically, their training data models only single-object translational movement examples, that lack the complexity of multiple dynamic objects in real-world videos. To overcome this limitation, we enable our model to learn complex temporal dynamics, involving multi-instance motion, from real-world videos without requiring human annotations. Specifically, we propose S2D, an approach for training video instance segmentation model to make dense predictions by training on sparse set of temporally-coherent, high-quality keymasks, predicted by an unsupervised image instance segmenter. We achieve this relying on three key insights. First, we can extract high-confidence masks for certain frames with existing image unsupervised instance segmentation models. Second, we can identify which frames contain reliable masks by inspecting their temporal coherence. Lastly, we can train video instance segmentation model on sparse image annotations via Sparse-To-Dense distillation to achieve mask propagation. Our proposed pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1. In the first step, our Keymask Discovery algorithm identifies the quality of frame-wise image masks without human supervision by leveraging point tracks as deep motion prior. The resulting masks are identified as keymasks of the video, i.e., temporally-coherent instance masks. We predict single-frame masks using an off-the-shelf unsupervised image instance segmentation model. By tracking each single-frame mask over the entire video sequence, we identify when appearances and disappearances occur. Performing this analysis for all single-frame masks yields visibility groupings, which contain instance masks whose proxypropagations, i.e., point tracks, appear and disappear together. Following, we determine which of the simultaneously visible masks correspond to each other by applying our temporal correspondence matching. Using the overlap of proxy-propagations and per-frame instance masks, we subdivide the visibility groups into clusters that share temporal and spatial correspondence. This process yields sparse video annotations, i.e., the video instances have annotations for some frames where high-quality masks could be identified. However, our method aims to obtain mask annotations for video instances in every frame where they are visible, i.e., dense annotation set. To achieve this, we demonstrate that VideoMask2Former [4] can be trained as an implicit mask propagation & object discovery model. We propose novel approach for training this model on sparse annotations to complete the missing video instance masks. First, we waive the loss penalty for missing instance annotations by proposing Temporal DropLoss. Second, we propose Sparse-To-Dense Distillation, where we train student model to learn dense predictions, guided by teacher model. Sparse-To-Dense Distillation results in dense video annotation set, which we further refine in another round of training. Since our process to generate pseudolabelsets is applicable to any video dataset, we experiment with scaling the training video data beyond the in-domain data and find that this yields strong zero-shot performance. In summary, we propose the following contributions: 1. We propose Keymask Discovery algorithm to construct sparse pseudo-labelset of hig"

OpenDataArena (ODA) is an open platform that benchmarks post-training datasets for Large Language Models (LLMs) using a unified pipeline, multi-dimensional scoring, and data lineage exploration to enhance reproducibility and understanding of data impacts on model behavior.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is predicated on the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. However, a critical dichotomy persists: while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data fueling them remains a black box--characterized by opaque composition, uncertain provenance, and a lack of systematic evaluation. This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), a holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes a comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) a unified training-evaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) a multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) a fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODA--covering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data points--reveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets. We release all results, tools, and configurations to democratize access to high-quality data evaluation. Rather than merely expanding a leaderboard, ODA envisions a shift from trial-and-error data curation to a principled science of Data-Centric AI, paving the way for rigorous studies on data mixing laws and the strategic composition of foundation models.

A framework aggregates weak predictions to recover semantic structure, enabling coherent SVG animations and improving VLM interactions with vector graphics.  					AI-generated summary 				 Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are central to modern web design, and the demand to animate them continues to grow as web environments become increasingly dynamic. Yet automating the animation of vector graphics remains challenging for vision-language models (VLMs) despite recent progress in code generation and motion planning. VLMs routinely mis-handle SVGs, since visually coherent parts are often fragmented into low-level shapes that offer little guidance of which elements should move together. In this paper, we introduce a framework that recovers the semantic structure required for reliable SVG animation and reveals the missing layer that current VLM systems overlook. This is achieved through a statistical aggregation of multiple weak part predictions, allowing the system to stably infer semantics from noisy predictions. By reorganizing SVGs into semantic groups, our approach enables VLMs to produce animations with far greater coherence. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains over existing approaches, suggesting that semantic recovery is the key step that unlocks robust SVG animation and supports more interpretable interactions between VLMs and vector graphics.

A task-adaptive Transformer (TAT) framework addresses challenges in medical image restoration by dynamically adjusting task-specific weights and loss balances, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to recover high-quality medical images from their low-quality counterparts. Recent advancements in MedIR have focused on All-in-One models capable of simultaneously addressing multiple different MedIR tasks. However, due to significant differences in both modality and degradation types, using a shared model for these diverse tasks requires careful consideration of two critical inter-task relationships: task interference, which occurs when conflicting gradient update directions arise across tasks on the same parameter, and task imbalance, which refers to uneven optimization caused by varying learning difficulties inherent to each task. To address these challenges, we propose a task-adaptive Transformer (TAT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts to different tasks through two key innovations. First, a task-adaptive weight generation strategy is introduced to mitigate task interference by generating task-specific weight parameters for each task, thereby eliminating potential gradient conflicts on shared weight parameters. Second, a task-adaptive loss balancing strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust loss weights based on task-specific learning difficulties, preventing task domination or undertraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed TAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks--PET synthesis, CT denoising, and MRI super-resolution--both in task-specific and All-in-One settings.

Zoom-Zero, a coarse-to-fine framework, enhances grounded video question answering by improving temporal grounding and answer accuracy through a zoom-in accuracy reward and token-selective credit assignment.  					AI-generated summary 				 Grounded video question answering (GVQA) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in videos and generate accurate answers to a given question; however, large video-language models (LVLMs) exhibit limited temporal awareness. Although existing approaches based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) attempt to improve temporal grounding, they still struggle to faithfully ground their answers in the relevant video evidence, leading to temporal mislocalization and hallucinations. In this work, we present Zoom-Zero, a coarse-to-fine framework that first localizes query-relevant segments and then temporally zooms into the most salient frames for finer-grained visual verification. Our method addresses the limits of GRPO for the GVQA task with two key innovations: (i) a zoom-in accuracy reward that validates the fidelity of temporal grounding prediction and facilitates fine-grained visual verification on grounded frames; (ii) token-selective credit assignment, which attributes rewards to the tokens responsible for temporal localization or answer generation, mitigating GRPO's issue in handling multi-faceted reward signals. Our proposed method advances grounded video question answering, improving temporal grounding by 5.2\% on NExT-GQA and 4.6\% on ReXTime, while also enhancing average answer accuracy by 2.4\%. Additionally, the coarse-to-fine zoom-in during inference further benefits long-form video understanding by preserving critical visual details without compromising global context, yielding an average improvement of 6.4\% on long-video benchmarks.

Cascaded domain-wise reinforcement learning (Cascade RL) is proposed to enhance general-purpose reasoning models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and outperforming the teacher model in coding competitions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Building general-purpose reasoning models with reinforcement learning (RL) entails substantial cross-domain heterogeneity, including large variation in inference-time response lengths and verification latency. Such variability complicates the RL infrastructure, slows training, and makes training curriculum (e.g., response length extension) and hyperparameter selection challenging. In this work, we propose cascaded domain-wise reinforcement learning (Cascade RL) to develop general-purpose reasoning models, Nemotron-Cascade, capable of operating in both instruct and deep thinking modes. Departing from conventional approaches that blend heterogeneous prompts from different domains, Cascade RL orchestrates sequential, domain-wise RL, reducing engineering complexity and delivering state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, RLHF for alignment, when used as a pre-step, boosts the model's reasoning ability far beyond mere preference optimization, and subsequent domain-wise RLVR stages rarely degrade the benchmark performance attained in earlier domains and may even improve it (see an illustration in Figure 1). Our 14B model, after RL, outperforms its SFT teacher, DeepSeek-R1-0528, on LiveCodeBench v5/v6/Pro and achieves silver-medal performance in the 2025 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). We transparently share our training and data recipes.

An unsupervised video instance segmentation model using real video data and deep motion priors outperforms existing methods by establishing temporal coherence and using sparse-to-dense distillation.  					AI-generated summary 				 In recent years, the state-of-the-art in unsupervised video instance segmentation has heavily relied on synthetic video data, generated from object-centric image datasets such as ImageNet. However, video synthesis by artificially shifting and scaling image instance masks fails to accurately model realistic motion in videos, such as perspective changes, movement by parts of one or multiple instances, or camera motion. To tackle this issue, we propose an unsupervised video instance segmentation model trained exclusively on real video data. We start from unsupervised instance segmentation masks on individual video frames. However, these single-frame segmentations exhibit temporal noise and their quality varies through the video. Therefore, we establish temporal coherence by identifying high-quality keymasks in the video by leveraging deep motion priors. The sparse keymask pseudo-annotations are then used to train a segmentation model for implicit mask propagation, for which we propose a Sparse-To-Dense Distillation approach aided by a Temporal DropLoss. After training the final model on the resulting dense labelset, our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art across various benchmarks.
