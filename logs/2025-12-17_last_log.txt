[ 1 1 4 9 2 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r AbstractBuilding extraction from remote sensing images is challenging task due to the complex structure variations of the buildings. Existing methods employ convolutional or self-attention blocks to capture the multi-scale features in the segmentation models, while the inherent gap of the feature pyramids and insufficient global-local feature integration leads to inaccurate, ambiguous extraction results. To address this issue, in this paper, we present an Uncertainty-Aggregated GlobalLocal Fusion Network (UAGLNet), which is capable to exploit high-quality global-local visual semantics under the guidance of uncertainty modeling. Specifically, we propose novel cooperative encoder, which adopts hybrid CNN and transformer layers at different stages to capture the local and global visual semantics, respectively. An intermediate cooperative interaction block (CIB) is designed to narrow the gap between the local and global features when the network becomes deeper. Afterwards, we propose Global-Local Fusion (GLF) module to complementarily fuse the global and local representations. Moreover, to mitigate the segmentation ambiguity in uncertain regions, we propose an Uncertainty-Aggregated Decoder (UAD) to explicitly estimate the pixel-wise uncertainty to enhance the segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Dstate/UAGLNet.

Afterwards, we propose Global-Local Fusion (GLF) module to complementarily fuse the global and local representations. Moreover, to mitigate the segmentation ambiguity in uncertain regions, we propose an Uncertainty-Aggregated Decoder (UAD) to explicitly estimate the pixel-wise uncertainty to enhance the segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Dstate/UAGLNet.

We construct complementary local and global representations of the buildings under the guidance of uncertainty modeling in dual branches, which enforces the model to focus on the ambiguous regions for high-quality building extraction. efficiently extract the buildings from aerial images has gained significant attention in the research community. Over the past few decades, numerous approaches have been proposed to extract the buildings from high-resolution RS images. Early works apply hand-crafted descriptors, e.g. texture [5], geometrical shape [6] and neighboring connection [7] to identify the pixels. Despite the intuitive simplicity, the manually extracted features are not effective in handling complex structure variations of the buildings. resulting in unsatisfying accuracy and limited generalization capability. Inspired by the significant successes of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), series of CNN based building extraction methods have emerged [1], [8], [9], [10]. These methods employ local convolution kernels to capture the discriminative features via forward-backward propagation, allowing the models to construct hierarchical semantic representation of the foreground buildings by large-scale model training. Unfortunately, as the CNN based architecture relies on stacking multiple convolutional layers/blocks with limited reception fields, it fails to capture the long-range relationship in different regions. In most recent years, the vision transformers (ViTs) have been applied in building extraction task [11], [12], [13]. The ViTs based approaches utilize non-local self-attention to capture the long-range dependencies, thus being able to excavate the informative global contexts for dense prediction. The most advanced approach GraphGST [14] aggregates the local-toglobal correlations by integrating graph structural information into the Transformer architecture. The positional encoder in 2 Kernel Feature Modulator (MKFM) is designed to extract the features with different reception fields, which is combined with the standard Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) in an intermediate cooperative interaction block (CIB). The features obtained by the CIB module in the third stage exhibits stronger discriminability while preserving local details. Second, to overcome the insufficient global-local feature integration, we design Global-Local Fusion (GLF) module. This module complementarily leverages the CIB outputs to compensate the local features and global features via efficient interaction. Finally, to enforce the models discriminative capability in challenging regions, these interacted global-local features are passed into Uncertainty Aggregated Decoder (UAD), which suppresses the low-confidence uncertain region and alleviate the segmentation uncertainties eventually. In conclusion, our contributions can be summarized as follows: We design Cooperative Encoder, which captures local/global information using intermediate cooperative interaction block (CIB) with hybrid convolutional and selfattention operators, allowing the model to narrow the inherent gap of the feature pyramids. We propose Global-Local Fusion (GLF) module t"

UAGLNet addresses building extraction challenges by integrating global and local features through a hybrid CNN and transformer cooperative encoder, intermediate interaction block, and uncertainty-aggregated decoder.  					AI-generated summary 				 Building extraction from remote sensing images is a challenging task due to the complex structure variations of the buildings. Existing methods employ convolutional or self-attention blocks to capture the multi-scale features in the segmentation models, while the inherent gap of the feature pyramids and insufficient global-local feature integration leads to inaccurate, ambiguous extraction results. To address this issue, in this paper, we present an Uncertainty-Aggregated Global-Local Fusion Network (UAGLNet), which is capable to exploit high-quality global-local visual semantics under the guidance of uncertainty modeling. Specifically, we propose a novel cooperative encoder, which adopts hybrid CNN and transformer layers at different stages to capture the local and global visual semantics, respectively. An intermediate cooperative interaction block (CIB) is designed to narrow the gap between the local and global features when the network becomes deeper. Afterwards, we propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) module to complementarily fuse the global and local representations. Moreover, to mitigate the segmentation ambiguity in uncertain regions, we propose an Uncertainty-Aggregated Decoder (UAD) to explicitly estimate the pixel-wise uncertainty to enhance the segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Dstate/UAGLNet

The paper focuses on advancing neural network architecture design and training methods for building extraction from remote sensing images. The key contributions involve optimization of feature integration through novel architectural components (cooperative encoder, interaction blocks, and uncertainty-aggregated decoder), which falls under optimization of model design and performance. While the paper mentions code availability on GitHub, it is not primarily a contribution to open-source projects but rather a research paper that happens to release code.
