Given reference image and text prompt, our model generates character-consistent videos that preserve visual details across diverse scenes, while prior methods struggle to retain all elements from the reference.

Green boxes indicate regions where these details are faithfully preserved, whereas red boxes mark inconsistencies, such as the collar mismatch in the lower left. Many other inconsistencies are omitted for simplicity.fail identity but Text-to-video (T2V) generation has advanced rapidly, yet maintaining consistent character identities across scenes remains major challenge. Existing personalization methods often focus on facial to preserve broader contextual cues such as hairstyle, outfit, and body shape, which are critical for visual coherence. We propose ContextAnyone, context-aware diffusion framework that achieves character-consistent video generation from text and single reference image. Our method jointly reconstructs the reference image and generates new video frames, enabling the model to fully perceive and utilize reference information. Reference information is effectively integrated into DiT-based diffusion backbone through novel Emphasize-Attention module that selectively reinforces reference-aware features and prevents identity drift across frames. dual-guidance loss combines diffusion and reference reconstruction objectives to enhance appearance fidelity, while the proposed Gap-RoPE positional embedding separates reference and video tokens to stabilize temporal modeling. Experiments demonstrate that ContextAnyone outperforms existing referenceto-video methods in identity consistency and visual quality, generating coherent and context-preserving character videos across diverse motions and scenes.

Introduction Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation[5, 6, 15, 23, 3335, 41] have enabled realistic and temporally coherent videos from natural language descriptions. However, generating characters that remain visually consistent across scenes and motions remains challenging. In real-world storytelling and film production, character is defined not only by facial identity but also by visual context such as hairstyle, outfit, and body shape. Preserving this context is essential for narrative continuity and visual coherence. As shown in the second and third rows of Figure 1, failing to preserve context leads to inconsistent clothing, causing perceptual discontinuity and reduced realism. Although recent diffusion-based models have improved fidelity and motion coherence, many personalization methods [24, 42, 43, 45] focus on identity transfer by injecting face features from face encoders. These approaches often capture only partial identity cues while neglecting contextual appearance. Recent works [10, 11, 20, 25] move beyond traditional identity-injection frameworks by introducing pixel-level [10] or channel-level [11] fusion to enhance contextual and subject consistency. However, such fusion does not ensure full utilization of reference information, and the model may still suffer from identity drift with complex visual structures, as shown in Figure 1. Furthermore, conventional cross-attention in video diffusion models offers limited control over how reference information influences temporal tokens, often causing unstable identity transfer during denoising. We present ContextAnyone, context-aware diffusion framework designed to generate character-consistent videos from text and single reference image. Our approach simultaneously reconstructs the reference image and generates new video frames. Reconstructing the reference image enables the model to fully perceive and understand all visual cues of the reference identity. Meanwhile, the reconstructed result can also serve as an anchor that provides detailed appearance inforamtion for subsequent video generation. To efficiently inject this anchor information into newly generated frames, we propose an attention modulation strategy, including an Emphasize-Attention module that selectively reinforces reference-aware information during denoising. To avoid the temporal collapse caused by reconstructing the reference image and generating new video frames simultaneously, we introduce Gap-RoPE to explicitly separate the positional embeddings of reference and video tokens for stable temporal modeling. In addition, we introduce dual encoders that extract complementary semantic and fine-grained features. Together, these components enable our model to produce coherent, identity-consistent, and context-preserving character videos under complex motions and scene variations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ContextAnyone achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art reference-to-video methods under the same parameter scale. As shown in Figure 1, our model generates realistic and temporally stable videos that preserve visual context and identity fidelity across diverse scenes. Quantitative results confirm higher identity consistency and visual quality, while ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of the various designs. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: We propose ContextAnyone, context-aware framework that jointly reconstructs the reference image and generates new frames, enabling comprehensive identity transferring. We introduce an attention modulation strategy with Emphasize-Attention to efficiently inject reference information and reinforce reference-aware cues. We design Gap-RoPE to explicitly separate positional embeddings of reference and video tokens for improved temporal stability, and employ dual encoders to capture complementary semantic and fine-grained visual features. Our method achieve SOTA performance among others under same parameter scale. 2. Related Works Diffusion Models for Video Generation Diffusion models have recently driven major advances in text-to-video (T2V) synthesis. Early methods [1, 12, 21, 31] extend pretrained image diffusion frameworks such as Stable Diffusion [30] by inserting lightweight temporal attention or motion adapter layers [16]. These extensions reuse strong spatial priors learned from large image datasets, enabling short video g"

A bilevel differentiable approach for evolving reward functions in reinforcement learning enhances agent performance across various domains by capturing task structure through reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 The design of effective reward functions presents a central and often arduous challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when developing autonomous agents for complex reasoning tasks. While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the "meta-gradient" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention.

"A bilevel differentiable approach for evolving reward functions in reinforcement learning enhances agent performance across various domains by capturing task structure through reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 The design of effective reward functions presents a central and often arduous challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when developing autonomous agents for complex reasoning tasks. While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the "meta-gradient" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention."

ContextAnyone uses a diffusion framework with emphasis attention and gap-rope positional embeddings to generate consistent character videos from text and a single reference image.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-video (T2V) generation has advanced rapidly, yet maintaining consistent character identities across scenes remains a major challenge. Existing personalization methods often focus on facial identity but fail to preserve broader contextual cues such as hairstyle, outfit, and body shape, which are critical for visual coherence. We propose ContextAnyone, a context-aware diffusion framework that achieves character-consistent video generation from text and a single reference image. Our method jointly reconstructs the reference image and generates new video frames, enabling the model to fully perceive and utilize reference information. Reference information is effectively integrated into a DiT-based diffusion backbone through a novel Emphasize-Attention module that selectively reinforces reference-aware features and prevents identity drift across frames. A dual-guidance loss combines diffusion and reference reconstruction objectives to enhance appearance fidelity, while the proposed Gap-RoPE positional embedding separates reference and video tokens to stabilize temporal modeling. Experiments demonstrate that ContextAnyone outperforms existing reference-to-video methods in identity consistency and visual quality, generating coherent and context-preserving character videos across diverse motions and scenes.
