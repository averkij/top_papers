Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results.

This task has traditionally been subset of semi-supervised video object segmentation, where the clue of target object is provided through means such as mask, scribble, or sentence in the first frame. Existing datasets in this context, such as DAVIS16-RVOS [3] and Refer-YouTube-VOS [4], typically encompass videos featuring isolated and salient objects with evident static characteristics. The corresponding expressions frequently contain static attributes like the objects color and shape, which can be identified from single frame. Consequently, motion properties of videos are less pronounced in these expressions, and methods designed for referring image segmentation can effectively be applied to referring video segmentation, yielding favorable performance [3], [5], [6], [7]. The motivation of this work is to emphasize the importance of temporal motion characteristics in videos and explore the feasibility of employing motion-related expressions to identify and segment objects within video content. To this end, we propose new large-scale dataset named Motion expressions Video Segmentation (MeViS). Some samples of MeViS are shown in Fig. 1. The MeViS dataset contains 2,006 videos with total of 8,171 distinct objects. In the conference version, MeViSv1 [1], 28,570 motion-related expressions are provided for referring and delineating these objects, focusing on direct motion descriptions Henghui Ding, Kaining Ying, and Yu-Gang Jiang are with Fudan University, China 200433.

Compared to MeViSv1 [1], the updated MeViSv2 in this work significantly expands the dataset with more challenging motion expressions, adding audio format expressions, providing tracking annotations, and supporting more tasks. First, the updated dataset includes 4,502 new challenging expressions, bringing the total to 33,072 expressionsthe largest in the field of referring video. These additions include motion reasoning expressions, which involve implicit queries requiring complex reasoning, and no-target expressions, which are deceptive motion descriptions that relate to the video but do not refer to any actual object, as shown in Fig. 3. In addition to text expressions, the updated MeViSv2 further provides above 150,000 seconds audio expressions, facilitating the study of audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) and multi-modal referring expressions. Furthermore, we provide tracking annotations in MeViSv2, establishing it as the largest referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) dataset. Beyond perception tasks, we introduce new task based on MeViS: Referring Motion Expression Generation (RMEG). This task aims to generate an unambiguous and concise motion expression for the selected objects in given video. In the construction of the MeViS dataset, several steps are undertaken to highlight the temporal motions inherent to videos. First, an assortment of videos is selected with the criterion that they showcase multiple interacting objects in motion, deliberately excluding low-quality videos where isolated objects could be easily described through static attributes alone. Second, the dataset prioritizes language expressions that focus on motion clues (e.g., walking, moving) rather than static clues (e.g., color, shape). These rules distinguish our MeViS from earlier datasets like [3], [4], [8], which contain salient targets in their videos or include obvious static clues in their sentence annotations.

A dataset for referring motion expression video segmentation, MeViS, is introduced to explore motion expression-guided video understanding and benchmarking.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper proposes a large-scale multi-modal dataset for referring motion expression video segmentation, focusing on segmenting and tracking target objects in videos based on language description of objects' motions. Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our dataset provides a platform that facilitates the development of motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex video scenes. The proposed MeViS dataset and the method's source code are publicly available at https://henghuiding.com/MeViS/
