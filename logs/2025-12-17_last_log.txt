Text:"REPO: Language Models with Context Re-Positioning Huayang Li 1 2 Tianyu Zhao 1 Richard Sproat 1 5 2 0 2 6 1 ] . [ 1 1 9 3 4 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r aIn-context learning is fundamental to modern Large Language Models (LLMs); however, prevailing architectures impose rigid and fixed contextual structure by assigning linear or constant positional indices. Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we argue that this uninformative structure increases extraneous cognitive load, consuming finite working memory capacity that should be allocated to deep reasoning and attention allocation. To address this, we propose REPO, novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, REPO utilizes differentiable module, fϕ, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pretraining on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that REPO significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general shortcontext tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that REPO successfully allocate higher attention to distant but relevant information, assign positions in dense and non-linear space, and capture the intrinsic structure of the input context. Our code is available at https://github.com/SakanaAI/repo. 1. Introduction The emergence of large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020) has enabled wide range of applications, including few-shot learning (Brown et al., 2020), retrievalaugmented generation (Lewis et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2023), and agentic systems (Schick et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023). At the core of these applications is in-context learning (Shen et al., 2024), form analogous to human working memory, 1Sakana AI, Japan 2Nara Institute of Science and Technology to: Huayang Li <li.huayang.lh6@is.naist.jp>, Tianyu Zhao <tianyu@sakana.ai>, Richard Sproat <rws@sakana.ai>. Correspondence (NAIST), Japan. Preprint. December 17, 2025. 1 Figure 1. Overall performance on four evaluation dimensions. where information within limited context window is temporarily stored and processed to solve task. Consequently, exploring how to effectively utilize context information has become fundamental research line in the LLM era (Wei et al., 2022; Weston & Sukhbaatar, 2023; Chen et al., 2023). Recent studies show that an LLMs ability to leverage contextual information is strongly influenced by its position encoding scheme (Vaswani et al., 2017; Press et al., 2021; Su et al., 2024). Most LLMs impose fixed contextual structure by assigning tokens consecutive integer indices from 0 to 1 (Vaswani et al., 2017) or constant index for all tokens (Kazemnejad et al., 2023). These indices are then integrated into model through position encoding functions, enforcing rigid organization of context. Although fixed position assignments have become the de facto standard, they deviate from how human working memory processes information. According to Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), the capacity of working memory during problem solving can be consumed by costs arising from how information is organized and presented, referred to as extraneous load (Sweller, 1994; Paas et al., 2003). CLT studies suggest that humans can actively reduce this extraneous load by reorganizing context, e.g., grouping related information into meaningful chunks (Miller, 1956) or removing irrelevant details from instructions (Sweller, 1994). Since working memory capacity is fixed, the capacity saved through such reorganization can be reallocated to deeper reasoning REPO : Language Models with Context Re-Positioning processes associated with the the germane load, thereby improving problem-solving performance (Sweller, 1994). However, the critical ability to reorganize and restructure contextual information (Vaswani et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2025a; Dubey et al., 2024) is absent from the architectural design of modern LLMs. From the perspective of CLT (Sweller, 1994; Paas et al., 2003), rigid linear or constant position structures can be interpreted as introducing additional extraneous load, which in turn impairs attention allocation and deeper contextual reasoning (i.e., germane processing). As consequence, tasks that require strong long-range or fine-grained contextual dependencies, e.g., needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) problems (Kamradt, 2023) or question answering under highly diluted contexts (Hsieh et al.), exhibit notable performance degradation, mirroring the effects predicted by CLT under high extraneous load. Moreover, from probabilistic standpoint, these position assignment strategies, essentially uniform distributions over fixed integer ranges, are the least informative organizations of context and therefore limit representational efficiency. We propose an internal mechanism for LLMs to reduce extraneous load by re-organizing the positions of tokens. We formalize this process, termed context Re-Positioning (REPO), as learning non-constrained position values based on information relevance of tokens, instead of using the fixed linear positions in prior work. To this end, we introduce differentiable module fϕ, which assigns position value in continuous space for each token based on its hidden state. The fϕ can be independently learned for each attention head of an LLM. Trained on general data, fϕ learns to re-position tokens free from conventional constraints like monotonicity or integer values. The continuity of modern position encoding functions, e.g., RoPE (Su et al., 2024) and ALiBi (Press et al., 2021) methods, is key to the end-to-end optimization of fϕ, as it allows these assigned positions to be integrated in differentiable manner. We find that LLMs using the REPO method achieve consistent performance gains on tasks involving noisy context, structured data, and longer context. In our experiments, we continually pre-trained LLMs with the REPO method and several baselines based on the OLMo-2 1B model. Within the training context length, our REPO method outperforms other baselines by at least 6.24 and 1.16 points on noisy context and structured data tasks, respectively. In addition, when extending the testing context length to 16K tokens using the YaRN (Peng et al., 2024) method, our REPO method outperforms other baselines by at least 13.25 EM points on the QA and Needle-in-the-haystack (NIAH) tasks and 5.48 points on LongBench (Bai et al., 2"

At the core of our method is a compressed set of structured spacetime latents. Specifically, (1) To address the scarcity of 4D training data, we build on a pre-trained single-image-to-3D model, preserving strong spatial consistency. (2) Temporal consistency is enforced by introducing dedicated temporal layers that reason across frames.

EVOLVE-VLA, a test-time training framework for Vision-Language-Action models, enables continuous adaptation through environmental interaction with minimal task-specific demonstrations, achieving significant improvements in performance and generalization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Achieving truly adaptive embodied intelligence requires agents that learn not just by imitating static demonstrations, but by continuously improving through environmental interaction, which is akin to how humans master skills through practice. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by leveraging large language models, yet remain fundamentally limited by Supervised Finetuning (SFT): requiring hundreds of demonstrations per task, rigidly memorizing trajectories, and failing to adapt when deployment conditions deviate from training. We introduce EVOLVE-VLA, a test-time training framework enabling VLAs to continuously adapt through environment interaction with minimal or zero task-specific demonstrations. The key technical challenge is replacing oracle reward signals (unavailable at test time) with autonomous feedback. We address this through a learned progress estimator providing dense feedback, and critically, we design our framework to ``tame'' this inherently noisy signal via two mechanisms: (1) an accumulative progress estimation mechanism smoothing noisy point-wise estimates, and (2) a progressive horizon extension strategy enabling gradual policy evolution. EVOLVE-VLA achieves substantial gains: +8.6\% on long-horizon tasks, +22.0\% in 1-shot learning, and enables cross-task generalization -- achieving 20.8\% success on unseen tasks without task-specific demonstrations training (vs. 0\% for pure SFT). Qualitative analysis reveals emergent capabilities absent in demonstrations, including error recovery and novel strategies. This work represents a critical step toward VLAs that truly learn and adapt, moving beyond static imitation toward continuous self-improvements.

We address this through a learned progress estimator providing dense feedback, and critically, we design our framework to ``tame'' this inherently noisy signal via two mechanisms: (1) an accumulative progress estimation mechanism smoothing noisy point-wise estimates, and (2) a progressive horizon extension strategy enabling gradual policy evolution. EVOLVE-VLA achieves substantial gains: +8.6\% on long-horizon tasks, +22.0\% in 1-shot learning, and enables cross-task generalization -- achieving 20.8\% success on unseen tasks without task-specific demonstrations training (vs. 0\% for pure SFT). Qualitative analysis reveals emergent capabilities absent in demonstrations, including error recovery and novel strategies. This work represents a critical step toward VLAs that truly learn and adapt, moving beyond static imitation toward continuous self-improvements."

Sparse-LaViDa accelerates Masked Discrete Diffusion Models by dynamically truncating masked tokens during inference, maintaining quality and achieving up to a 2x speedup across various tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Masked Discrete Diffusion Models (MDMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks, including image understanding, generation, and editing. However, their inference speed remains suboptimal due to the need to repeatedly process redundant masked tokens at every sampling step. In this work, we propose Sparse-LaViDa, a novel modeling framework that dynamically truncates unnecessary masked tokens at each inference step to accelerate MDM sampling. To preserve generation quality, we introduce specialized register tokens that serve as compact representations for the truncated tokens. Furthermore, to ensure consistency between training and inference, we design a specialized attention mask that faithfully matches the truncated sampling procedure during training. Built upon the state-of-the-art unified MDM LaViDa-O, Sparse-LaViDa achieves up to a 2x speedup across diverse tasks including text-to-image generation, image editing, and mathematical reasoning, while maintaining generation quality.

RePo, a novel context re-positioning mechanism in LLMs, reduces extraneous cognitive load by differentiably assigning token positions, enhancing performance on noisy and long contexts without compromising short-context tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 In-context learning is fundamental to modern Large Language Models (LLMs); however, prevailing architectures impose a rigid and fixed contextual structure by assigning linear or constant positional indices. Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we argue that this uninformative structure increases extraneous cognitive load, consuming finite working memory capacity that should be allocated to deep reasoning and attention allocation. To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, f_φ, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that RePo successfully allocate higher attention to distant but relevant information, assign positions in dense and non-linear space, and capture the intrinsic structure of the input context.

A novel vision-language model framework improves task success rates for mobile GUI agents by using semantic world models instead of pixel-based predictions.  					AI-generated summary 				 World models have shown great utility in improving the task performance of embodied agents. While prior work largely focuses on pixel-space world models, these approaches face practical limitations in GUI settings, where predicting complex visual elements in future states is often difficult. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of world modeling for GUI agents, where state transitions are described in natural language rather than predicting raw pixels. First, we introduce MobileWorldBench, a benchmark that evaluates the ability of vision-language models (VLMs) to function as world models for mobile GUI agents. Second, we release MobileWorld, a large-scale dataset consisting of 1.4M samples, that significantly improves the world modeling capabilities of VLMs. Finally, we propose a novel framework that integrates VLM world models into the planning framework of mobile agents, demonstrating that semantic world models can directly benefit mobile agents by improving task success rates. The code and dataset is available at https://github.com/jacklishufan/MobileWorld

"A novel vision-language model framework improves task success rates for mobile GUI agents by using semantic world models instead of pixel-based predictions.  					AI-generated summary 				 World models have shown great utility in improving the task performance of embodied agents. While prior work largely focuses on pixel-space world models, these approaches face practical limitations in GUI settings, where predicting complex visual elements in future states is often difficult. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of world modeling for GUI agents, where state transitions are described in natural language rather than predicting raw pixels. First, we introduce MobileWorldBench, a benchmark that evaluates the ability of vision-language models (VLMs) to function as world models for mobile GUI agents. Second, we release MobileWorld, a large-scale dataset consisting of 1.4M samples, that significantly improves the world modeling capabilities of VLMs. Finally, we propose a novel framework that integrates VLM world models into the planning framework of mobile agents, demonstrating that semantic world models can directly benefit mobile agents by improving task success rates. The code and dataset is available at https://github.com/jacklishufan/MobileWorld"
