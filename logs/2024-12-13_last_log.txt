Synthetic data constitutes the bulk of the training data for phi-4 and is generated using diverse array of techniques, including multi-agent prompting, self-revision workflows, and instruction reversal. These methods enable the construction of datasets that induce stronger reasoning and problem-solving abilities in the model, addressing some of the weaknesses in traditional unsupervised datasets. Synthetic data in phi-4 also plays crucial role in post-training, where techniques such as rejection sampling and novel approach to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are employed to refine the models outputs. The development of phi-4 is guided by three core pillars: 1. Synthetic Data for Pretraining and Midtraining: High-quality synthetic datasets are designed to prioritize reasoning and problem-solving, carefully generated to ensure diversity and 1 Small models Large models phi-4 14b phi-3 14b Qwen 2.5 14b instruct GPT 4o-mini Llama-3.3 70b instruct Qwen 2.5 72b instruct GPT 4o v - m MMLU GPQA MATH HumanEval MGSM SimpleQA DROP MMLUPro HumanEval+ ArenaHard LiveBench IFEval PhiBench (internal) 84.8 56.1 80.4 82.6 80.6 3.0 75.5 70.4 82.8 75.4 47.6 63.0 77.9 31.2 44.6 67.8 53.5 7.6 68.3 51.3 69.2 45.8 28.1 57.9 56. 43.9 79.9 42.9 75.6 72.1 79.6 5.4 85.5 63.2 79.1 70.2 46.6 78.7 49.8 81.8 40.9 73.0 86.2 86.5 9.9 79.3 63.4 82.0 76.2 48.1 80. 58.7 86.3 49.1 66.31 78.91 89.1 20.9 90.2 64.4 77.9 65.5 57.6 89.3 57.1 85.3 49.0 80.0 80.4 87.3 10.2 76.7 69.6 78.4 78.4 55.3 85. 64.6 88.1 50.6 74.6 90.6 90.4 39.4 80.9 73.0 88.0 75.6 57.6 84.8 72.4 Table 1: Performance of phi-4 on set of standard benchmarks. The first set of benchmarks uses OpenAIs simple-evals framework [Ope24b], specifying the prompts/extraction/temperature=0.5. We compare to small models of similar inference cost, as well as to larger models. relevance. We change our training curriculum and create new pretraining and midtraining data mixtures to increase the allocation of synthetic tokens, compared to older generations of phi. 2. Curation and Filtering of High-Quality Organic Data: We meticulously curate and filter organic2 data sources, including web content, licensed books, and code repositories to extract seeds for the synthetic data pipeline that encourage high-depth reasoning and prioritize educational value (to the model). These seeds form the foundation of the synthetic generation pipeline. To complement these synthetic datasets, we also filter the web for high-quality data (in terms of knowledge and reasoning) to use directly in pretraining. 3. Post-Training: We further advance the post-training recipe in phi-4 by creating new refined versions of SFT datasets, as well as by developing new technique to create DPO pairs, based on pivotal token search. With these innovations, the performance of phi-4 on reasoning-related tasks is comparable to or surpasses much larger models. For example, its performance on many widely used reasoning-related benchmarks meets or exceeds that of Llama-3.1-405B. In Table 1 we compare the performance of our model on academic benchmarks to several contemporary foundation models. We find that phi4 significantly exceeds its teacher GPT-4o on the GPQA (graduate-level STEM Q&A) and MATH (math competition) benchmarks. 1These scores are lower than those reported by Meta, perhaps because simple-evals has strict formatting requirement that Llama models have particular trouble following. We use the simple-evals framework because it is reproducible, but Meta reports 77 for MATH and 88 for HumanEval on Llama-3.3. 2We use organic to refer to human-generated or otherwise non-synthetic data. Figure 1: Average performance of different models on the November 2024 AMC-10 and AMC-12 tests. This is the average score (with maximum score 150) over the four tests on 100 runs with temperature = 0.5. We chose = 0.5 to follow simple-evals [Ope24b]. Error bars are 2σ of the estimate. On competition math, phi-4 scores well above its weight-class even compared to nonopen-weight models.Decontamination: One pitfall of foundation models is overfitting to benchmarks, such as through the leakage of benchmark test sets via the web corpus. We improved the data decontamination process for phi-4 compared to previous Phi models to ensure no unfair influence on evaluation results. More details of the decontamination method are given in Appendix B. AMC Benchmark: The surest way to guard against overfitting to the test set is to test on fresh data. We tested our model on the November 2024 AMC-10 and AMC-12 math competitions [Com24], which occurred after all our training data was collected, and we only measured our performance after choosing all the hyperparameters in training our final model. These contests are the entry points to the Math Olympiad track"

We present phi-4, a 14-billion parameter language model developed with a training recipe that is centrally focused on data quality. Unlike most language models, where pre-training is based primarily on organic data sources such as web content or code, phi-4 strategically incorporates synthetic data throughout the training process. While previous models in the Phi family largely distill the capabilities of a teacher model (specifically GPT-4), phi-4 substantially surpasses its teacher model on STEM-focused QA capabilities, giving evidence that our data-generation and post-training techniques go beyond distillation. Despite minimal changes to the phi-3 architecture, phi-4 achieves strong performance relative to its size -- especially on reasoning-focused benchmarks -- due to improved data, training curriculum, and innovations in the post-training scheme.

  "desc": "Статья представляет phi-4 - языковую модель с 14 миллиардами параметров, разработанную с акцентом на качество данных. В отличие от большинства моделей, phi-4 стратегически использует синтетические данные на протяжении всего процесса обучения. Модель превосходит своего учителя GPT-4 в задачах вопросов-ответов по STEM-тематике, что свидетельствует о эффективности методов генерации данных и пост-обучения. Несмотря на минимальные изменения в архитектуре, phi-4 достигает высокой производительности благодаря улучшенным данным, учебной программе и инновациям в схеме пост-обучения.",
