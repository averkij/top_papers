[ 1 7 3 7 8 0 . 2 1 4 2 : r Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress in recent years, yet continue to struggle with low-level visual perception (LLVP)particularly the ability to accurately describe the geometric details of an image. This capability is crucial for applications in areas such as robotics, medical image analysis, and manufacturing. In this paper, we first introduce Geoperception, benchmark designed to evaluate an MLLMs ability to accurately transcribe 2D geometric information from an image. Using this benchmark, we demonstrate the limitations of leading MLLMs, and then conduct comprehensive empirical study to explore strategies for improving their performance on geometric tasks. Our findings highlight the benefits of certain model architectures, training techniques, and data strategies, including the use of high-fidelity synthetic data and multi-stage training with data curriculum. Notably, we find that data curriculum enables models to learn challenging geometry understanding tasks which they fail to learn from scratch. Leveraging these insights, we develop Euclid, family of models specifically optimized for strong low-level geometric perception. Although purely trained on synthetic multimodal data, Euclid shows strong generalization ability to novel geometry shapes. For instance, Euclid outperforms the best closed-source model, Gemini-1.5-Pro, by up to 58.56% on certain Geoperception benchmark tasks and 10.65% on average across all tasks.

Text:"4 2 0 2 2 1 ] . e [ 1 5 0 4 9 0 . 2 1 4 2 : r a Dan Jacobellis and Neeraja J. Yadwadkar University of Texas at Austin Austin, TX, 78712, USA danjacobellis@utexas.edu neeraja@austin.utexas.edu Abstract Modern sensors produce increasingly rich streams of high-resolution data. Due to resource constraints, machine learning systems discard the vast majority of this information via resolution reduction. Compressed-domain learning allows models to operate on compact latent representations, allowing higher effective resolution for the same budget. However, existing compression systems are not ideal for compressed learning. Linear transform coding and end-to-end learned compression systems reduce bitrate, but do not uniformly reduce dimensionality; thus, they do not meaningfully increase efficiency. Generative autoencoders reduce dimensionality, but their adversarial or perceptual objectives lead to significant information loss. To address these limitations, we introduce WaLLoC (Wavelet Learned Lossy Compression), neural codec architecture that combines linear transform coding with nonlinear dimensionality-reducing autoencoders. WaLLoC sandwiches shallow, asymmetric autoencoder and entropy bottleneck between an invertible wavelet packet transform. Across several key metrics, WaLLoC outperforms the autoencoders used in state-of-the-art latent diffusion models. WaLLoC does not require perceptual or adversarial losses to represent high-frequency detail, providing compatibility with modalities beyond RGB images and stereo audio. WaLLoCs encoder consists almost entirely of linear operations, making it exceptionally efficient and suitable for mobile computing, remote sensing, and learning directly from compressed data. We demonstrate WaLLoCs capability for compressed-domain learning across several tasks, including image classification, colorization, document understanding, and music source separation.

Significant achievements in personalization of diffusion models have been witnessed. Conventional tuning-free methods mostly encode multiple reference images by averaging their image embeddings as the injection condition, but such an image-independent operation cannot perform interaction among images to capture consistent visual elements within multiple references. Although the tuning-based Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively extract consistent elements within multiple images through the training process, it necessitates specific finetuning for each distinct image group. This paper introduces EasyRef, a novel plug-and-play adaptation method that enables diffusion models to be conditioned on multiple reference images and the text prompt. To effectively exploit consistent visual elements within multiple images, we leverage the multi-image comprehension and instruction-following capabilities of the multimodal large language model (MLLM), prompting it to capture consistent visual elements based on the instruction. Besides, injecting the MLLM's representations into the diffusion process through adapters can easily generalize to unseen domains, mining the consistent visual elements within unseen data. To mitigate computational costs and enhance fine-grained detail preservation, we introduce an efficient reference aggregation strategy and a progressive training scheme. Finally, we introduce MRBench, a new multi-reference image generation benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate EasyRef surpasses both tuning-free methods like IP-Adapter and tuning-based methods like LoRA, achieving superior aesthetic quality and robust zero-shot generalization across diverse domains.

Modern sensors produce increasingly rich streams of high-resolution data. Due to resource constraints, machine learning systems discard the vast majority of this information via resolution reduction. Compressed-domain learning allows models to operate on compact latent representations, allowing higher effective resolution for the same budget. However, existing compression systems are not ideal for compressed learning. Linear transform coding and end-to-end learned compression systems reduce bitrate, but do not uniformly reduce dimensionality; thus, they do not meaningfully increase efficiency. Generative autoencoders reduce dimensionality, but their adversarial or perceptual objectives lead to significant information loss. To address these limitations, we introduce WaLLoC (Wavelet Learned Lossy Compression), a neural codec architecture that combines linear transform coding with nonlinear dimensionality-reducing autoencoders. WaLLoC sandwiches a shallow, asymmetric autoencoder and entropy bottleneck between an invertible wavelet packet transform. Across several key metrics, WaLLoC outperforms the autoencoders used in state-of-the-art latent diffusion models. WaLLoC does not require perceptual or adversarial losses to represent high-frequency detail, providing compatibility with modalities beyond RGB images and stereo audio. WaLLoC's encoder consists almost entirely of linear operations, making it exceptionally efficient and suitable for mobile computing, remote sensing, and learning directly from compressed data. We demonstrate WaLLoC's capability for compressed-domain learning across several tasks, including image classification, colorization, document understanding, and music source separation. Our code, experiments, and pre-trained audio and image codecs are available at https://ut-sysml.org/walloc

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models are typically trained on datasets with limited exposure to Scientific, Technical and Educational domains. Translation models thus, in general, struggle with tasks that involve scientific understanding or technical jargon. Their performance is found to be even worse for low-resource Indian languages. Finding a translation dataset that tends to these domains in particular, poses a difficult challenge. In this paper, we address this by creating a multilingual parallel corpus containing more than 2.8 million rows of English-to-Indic and Indic-to-Indic high-quality translation pairs across 8 Indian languages. We achieve this by bitext mining human-translated transcriptions of NPTEL video lectures. We also finetune and evaluate NMT models using this corpus and surpass all other publicly available models at in-domain tasks. We also demonstrate the potential for generalizing to out-of-domain translation tasks by improving the baseline by over 2 BLEU on average for these Indian languages on the Flores+ benchmark. We are pleased to release our model and dataset via this link: https://huggingface.co/SPRINGLab.

"Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models are typically trained on datasets with limited exposure to Scientific, Technical and Educational domains. Translation models thus, in general, struggle with tasks that involve scientific understanding or technical jargon. Their performance is found to be even worse for low-resource Indian languages. Finding a translation dataset that tends to these domains in particular, poses a difficult challenge. In this paper, we address this by creating a multilingual parallel corpus containing more than 2.8 million rows of English-to-Indic and Indic-to-Indic high-quality translation pairs across 8 Indian languages. We achieve this by bitext mining human-translated transcriptions of NPTEL video lectures. We also finetune and evaluate NMT models using this corpus and surpass all other publicly available models at in-domain tasks. We also demonstrate the potential for generalizing to out-of-domain translation tasks by improving the baseline by over 2 BLEU on average for these Indian languages on the Flores+ benchmark. We are pleased to release our model and dataset via this link: https://huggingface.co/SPRINGLab."
