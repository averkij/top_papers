Text:"5 2 0 2 1 2 ] . [ 1 3 6 7 5 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r Intern-S1 Technical Report INTERN-S1: SCIENTIFIC MULTIMODAL FOUNDATION MODEL Intern-S1 Team, Shanghai AI LaboratoryIn recent years, plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged, achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between open-source models and closedsource models in these scientific domains. To mitigate this gap and explore step further toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we introduce InternS1, specialized generalist equipped with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze multiple science modal data. InternS1 is multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters, continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and training systems, Intern-S1 achieved toptier performance in online RL training. On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at https://huggingface.co/internlm/Intern-S1.Scientific research, recognized as one of the ultimate goals in the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) due to its potential to drive fundamental breakthroughs in human society, imposes uniquely stringent demands on AI systems. It requires models not only to understand and capture the intrinsic laws underlying diverse but low-resource distributed scientific modalitiesranging from molecular structures to time-series signalsbut also perform long-term, rigorous reasoning processes, such as hypothesis validation and experimental design optimization. These requirements collectively necessitate the development of multimodal large reasoning model capable of comprehending scientific modalities, serving as foundational tool to accelerate scientific discovery. Over the past few years, open-source multimodal large models, primarily centered on visionlanguage modalities, and large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved rapid progress. Notably, in areas of widespread public attentionsuch as natural image understanding, mathematical problemsolving, and code generationthese open-source models (Zhu et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025a; Yang et al., 2025) have approached or even partially surpassed their closed-source counterparts (OpenAI et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2025; Anthropic, 2025; DeepMind, 2025). This advancement has sparked growing expectations for their application in the more challenging science domains. However, in high-value yet more challenging scientific scenarios, the progress of open-source foundation models lags significantly behind their development in popular domains such as mathematics and code. Moreover, substantial gap remains between open-source and closed-source models (OpenAI, 2025; 1 Intern-S1 Technical Report xAI, 2025; DeepMind, 2025) in these scientific areas, limiting the former to contribute meaningfully to cutting-edge research. Figure 1: Performance comparison among open-source and close-source models on Image-text and Text-only Benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Intern-S1 has top-tier general reasoning capability among open-source models and outperforms closed-source models in scientific domains. General benchmarks: MMLU-Pro (text-only), GPQA (text-only), AIME2025 (text-only), MMMU, MMStar Science benchmarks: SmolInstruct (text-only), ChemBech (text-only), MatBench (text-only), SFE, Physics To bridge this gap in scientific understanding and reasoning capabilities between open-source and closed-source models, and to propel open-source models one step closer to AGI, in this report, we share our experience and key findings from building Intern-S1, an open-source scientific multimodal model designed for solving complex scientific tasks, which is capable of processing images, text, and scientific data, including non-natural visual data, molecular structures, and time-series signals. As shown in the Figure 1, Intern-S1 outperforms both open-source and close-source models on image-text or text-only scientific tasks. Besides presenting strong model, Intern-S1 represents step forward in our exploration of finding viable path toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Figure 2 shows that while recent models have made significant improvements in math and general reasoning, they still struggle in science domains that have relatively fewer data. Even if the community can further accelerate the advance of open-source models, their capabilities do not grow evenly across different domains, its challenging to develop an intelligence system in general domains. Figure 2: Performance trend of LLMs across popular and low-resource (science) tasks. The X-axis is the average of three popular general benchmarks, MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME2025. The Y-axis is the average of three benchmarks in science domain, SmolInstruct, ChemBench, MatBench. Although the top-tier open-source LLMs raised their performance on popular tasks rapidly, their performance on science tasks does not increase. We believe its important to discuss the problem, How can we enhance models capability to tackle low-resource tasks in scalable way? Note that the scalability is essential. Unlike in popular domains, we can not heavily rely on heuristics and priors for every low-resource task. Thus, we tackle this problem from more scalable perspectives in pre-training and post-training stages, respectively. 2 Intern-S1 Technical Report In the pre-training stage, the key challenge is to prepare larg"

Text:"Fin-PRM: Domain-Specialized Process Reward Model for Financial Reasoning in Large Language Models Yuanchen Zhou1*, Shuo Jiang1,2*, Jie Zhu1, Junhui Li3, Lifan Guo1, Feng Chen1, Chi Zhang1 1Qwen DianJin Team, Alibaba Cloud Computing 2Osaka University 3Soochow University 5 2 0 2 1 2 ] . [ 1 2 0 2 5 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r Abstract Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as promising framework for supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce Fin-PRM, domainspecialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i) selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time. Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains of 12.9% in supervised learning, 5.2% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1% in test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domainspecialized reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expertlevel financial reasoning.

AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting. However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think with Confidence (DeepConf), a simple yet powerful method that enhances both reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series. Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full parallel thinking.

SceneGen generates multiple 3D assets from a single scene image using a novel framework that integrates local and global scene information, enabling efficient and robust 3D content creation.  					AI-generated summary 				 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture. Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval; (ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of 3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass; (iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation, potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code and model will be publicly available at: https://mengmouxu.github.io/SceneGen.

Fin-PRM, a domain-specialized reward model for finance, enhances intermediate reasoning in LLMs through step-level and trajectory-level supervision, improving performance in supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and test-time inference.  					AI-generated summary 				 Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce Fin-PRM, a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i) selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time. Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning.
