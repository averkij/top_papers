Text:"5 2 0 2 1 2 ] . [ 1 1 6 7 5 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r WAVER: WAVE YOUR WAY TO LIFELIKE VIDEO GENERATIONWe present Waver, high-performance foundation model for unified image and video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging from 5 to 10 seconds at native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V), imageto-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within single, integrated framework. We introduce Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data quality, we establish comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably, it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art commercial solutions. We hope this technical report will help the community more efficiently train high-quality video generation models and accelerate progress in video generation technologies.

Text:"ATLAS: Decoupling Skeletal and Shape Parameters for Expressive Parametric Human Modeling Jinhyung Park1,2 Yichen Xu1 Javier Romero1 Federica Bogo1 Shunsuke Saito1 Shoou-I Yu1 Kris Kitani1,2 Rawal Khirodkar1 Fabian Prada1 Takaaki Shiratori 5 2 0 2 1 2 ] . [ 1 7 6 7 5 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r 1Meta 2Carnegie Mellon University https://jindapark.github.io/projects/atlas Figure 1. ATLAS enables precise, decoupled control of skeletal and surface attributes. Here, we customize mesh to reduce shoulder width and increase body weight. This level of control is difficult to accomplish in prior work [39] due to undesirable correlations between joints and vertices, e.g. adjusting shoulder width affects the entire body and increasing weight reverses the shoulder adjustment. With ATLASs decoupled skeleton and shape, this customization is simple two-step deterministic edit. Abstract Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by learning basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes the external body surface using linear basis, then regresses internal skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present ATLAS, high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity, fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting indepen"

INTRODUCTION With the exponential growth of video data, video understanding has become central focus in multimodal research. In tasks such as question answering and caption generation, there is growing demand for fine-grained modeling of when, where, and who is doing what within video. Unlike static long videos span extended durations and contain images, JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 2 dynamic, time-evolving content. Effective understanding requires not only recognizing spatial semantics but also capturing temporal dependencies, tracking object trajectories, and reasoning about the timing and location of specific events. This involves addressing challenges such as redundant frames, frequent scene changes, multi-entity interactions, and longrange temporal dependencies. Designing unified videolanguage framework with strong temporal modeling, precise object perception, and robust tracking remains key research problem. Recent Video-LLMs have attempted to bridge the gap between visual perception and temporal reasoning by adapting static vision-language frameworks with video-specific enhancements. These methods typically rely on frame sampling and image encoders to extract appearance features, followed by token compression or projection modules that interface with frozen LLMs. In addition, some models enhance temporal awareness through positional encodings, discrete timestamp tokens, or external prompts, while others attach segmentation masks or object anchors post-generation for entity visualization. Although these strategies improve basic temporal sensitivity and visual grounding, they often fail to explicitly model temporal evolution. First, temporal modeling is usually delegated to positional cues, lacking learnable latent variables that evolve over time. Second, segmentation and tracking are typically applied after language modeling, preventing early attention alignment and weakening reasoning consistency in multi-object scenarios. Third, token-level reasoning over time remains limited, as temporal structures are neither disentangled nor explicitly incorporated into the language modeling pipeline. To address the aforementioned limitations in long-video understanding, we propose Diffusion-Grounded VideoLLM, unified and lightweight framework that integrates structured temporal and entity-aware information prior to language modeling. This framework redefines the role of diffusion models in video understandingnot as generative models, but as efficient temporal feature extractors that capture dynamic changes across frames via conditional denoising. In parallel, we incorporate semantic segmentationbased object representations and apply cross-frame tracking to explicitly model the evolution of entities over time. To support joint reasoning, we design mixed-token input layout that encodes temporal, spatial, and linguistic information into unified sequence, providing the language model with structured and time-sensitive context. The overall architecture maintains high scalability and inference efficiency, significantly enhancing the models ability to localize key events, track entities, and reason about temporal relationships in long videos. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We introduce diffusion-based video encoder to capture inter-frame dynamics and temporal structures, generating differentiable temporal latent tokens that serve as informative inputs to the LLM. (2) Semantic segmentation is incorporated before language modeling, enabling object-level representation and crossframe consistency to support robust multi-entity tracking and grounding. (3) We design unified mixed-token input structure that encodes visual, textual, temporal, and object-level information into single sequence, enabling joint spatiotemporal reasoning in an end-to-end manner. (4) Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-video understanding benchmarks, including NExTQA and ActivityNet-Captions. II. RELATED WORK A.

Waver, a high-performance foundation model, generates high-quality videos and images using a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture, excelling in text-to-video, image-to-video, and text-to-image tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V), image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single, integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably, it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art commercial solutions. We hope this technical report will help the community more efficiently train high-quality video generation models and accelerate progress in video generation technologies.

ATLAS is a high-fidelity body model that decouples shape and skeleton bases, improving pose accuracy and shape expressivity using 600k high-resolution scans.  					AI-generated summary 				 Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity, fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture complex poses compared to linear models.

Geo-Visual Agents integrate geospatial images and GIS data to answer nuanced visual-spatial inquiries about the world.  					AI-generated summary 				 Interactive digital maps have revolutionized how people travel and learn about the world; however, they rely on pre-existing structured data in GIS databases (e.g., road networks, POI indices), limiting their ability to address geo-visual questions related to what the world looks like. We introduce our vision for Geo-Visual Agents--multimodal AI agents capable of understanding and responding to nuanced visual-spatial inquiries about the world by analyzing large-scale repositories of geospatial images, including streetscapes (e.g., Google Street View), place-based photos (e.g., TripAdvisor, Yelp), and aerial imagery (e.g., satellite photos) combined with traditional GIS data sources. We define our vision, describe sensing and interaction approaches, provide three exemplars, and enumerate key challenges and opportunities for future work.

A systematic review of large language model benchmarks identifies issues such as data contamination, cultural biases, and lack of process credibility, and proposes a design paradigm for future improvements.  					AI-generated summary 				 In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories: general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning; domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination, unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

Grounded VideoDiT addresses temporal perception and entity interaction in videos through a Diffusion Temporal Latent encoder, object grounded representations, and mixed token scheme, achieving state-of-the-art results on VideoQA benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity, and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA benchmarks.
