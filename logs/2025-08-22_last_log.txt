Text:"5 2 0 2 1 2 ] . [ 1 1 6 7 5 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r WAVER: WAVE YOUR WAY TO LIFELIKE VIDEO GENERATIONWe present Waver, high-performance foundation model for unified image and video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging from 5 to 10 seconds at native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V), imageto-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within single, integrated framework. We introduce Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data quality, we establish comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably, it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art commercial solutions. We hope this technical report will help the community more efficiently train high-quality video generation models and accelerate progress in video generation technologies.

Figure 1: Left: Human evaluation win rates (GSB) of Waver compared to Veo3, Kling2.0, and Wan2.1 on the Waver-bench 1.0 Text-to-Video (T2V) dataset across three dimensions: motion quality, visual quality, and prompt following.

Right: Human evaluation win rates (GSB) on the Hermes Motion Testset across three dimensions: motion quality, visual quality, and prompt following.

While recent Video-LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are encoded only implicitly, frame-level features are weak in capturing continuity, and languagevision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In this paper, we present GroundedVideoDiT, Video-LLM designed to overcome these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, Diffusion Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains temporal consistency. Second, object-grounded representations explicitly bind query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp modeling, enabling fine-grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs equip Grounded-VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by state-of-the-art results on Charades-STA, NExTGQA, and multiple VideoQA benchmarks. I. INTRODUCTION With the exponential growth of video data, video understanding has become central focus in multimodal research. In tasks such as question answering and caption generation, there is growing demand for fine-grained modeling of when, where, and who is doing what within video. Unlike static long videos span extended durations and contain images, JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 2 dynamic, time-evolving content. Effective understanding requires not only recognizing spatial semantics but also capturing temporal dependencies, tracking object trajectories, and reasoning about the timing and location of specific events. This involves addressing challenges such as redundant frames, frequent scene changes, multi-entity interactions, and longrange temporal dependencies. Designing unified videolanguage framework with strong temporal modeling, precise object perception, and robust tracking remains key research problem. Recent Video-LLMs have attempted to bridge the gap between visual perception and temporal reasoning by adapting static vision-language frameworks with video-specific enhancements. These methods typically rely on frame sampling and image encoders to extract appearance features, followed by token compression or projection modules that interface with frozen LLMs. In addition, some models enhance temporal awareness through positional encodings, discrete timestamp tokens, or external prompts, while others attach segmentation masks or object anchors post-generation for entity visualization. Although these strategies improve basic temporal sensitivity and visual grounding, they often fail to explicitly model temporal evolution. First, temporal modeling is usually delegated to positional cues, lacking learnable latent variables that evolve over time. Second, segmentation and tracking are typically applied after language modeling, preventing early attention alignment and weakening reasoning consistency in multi-object scenarios. Third, token-level reasoning over time remains limited, as temporal structures are neither disentangled nor explicitly incorporated into the language modeling pipeline. To address the aforementioned limitations in long-video understanding, we propose Diffusion-Grounded VideoLLM, unified and lightweight framework that integrates structured temporal and entity-aware information prior to language modeling. This framework redefines the role of diffusion models in video understandingnot as generative models, but as efficient temporal feature extractors that capture dynamic changes across frames via conditional denoising. In parallel, we incorporate semantic segmentationbased object representations and apply cross-frame tracking to explicitly model the evolution of entities over time. To support joint reasoning, we design mixed-token input layout that encodes temporal, spatial, and linguistic information into unified sequence, providing the language model with structured and time-sensitive context. The overall architecture maintains high scalability and inference efficiency, significantly enhancing the models ability to localize key events, track entities, and reason about temporal relationships in long videos. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We introduce diffusion-based video encoder to capture inter-frame dynamics and temporal structures, generating differentiable temporal latent tokens that serve as informative inputs to the LLM. (2) Semantic segmentation is incorporated before language modeling, enabling object-level representation and crossframe consistency to support robust multi-entity tracking and grounding. (3) We design unified mixed-token input structure that encodes visual, textual, temporal, and object-level information into single sequence, enabling joint spatiotemporal reasoning in an end-to-end manner. (4) Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-video understanding benchmarks, including NExTQA and ActivityNet-Captions. II. RELATED WORK A.
