[ 1 3 7 2 0 2 . 2 0 6 2 : r Large language models (LLMs) have been reported to linearly encode truthfulness, yet recent work questions this findings generality. We reconcile these views with the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: the representational space contains directions ranging from broadly domain-general to narrowly domain-specific. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate probe generalization across five truth types (definitional, empirical, logical, fictional, and ethical), sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying, and existing honesty benchmarks. Linear probes generalize well across most domains but fail on sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying. Yet training on all domains jointly recovers strong performance, confirming that domain-general directions exist despite poor pairwise transfer. The geometry of probe directions explains these patterns: Mahalanobis cosine similarity between probes nearperfectly predicts cross-domain generalization (R2=0.98). Concept-erasure methods further isolate truth directions that are (1) domain-general, (2) domain-specific, or (3) shared only across particular domain subsets. Causal interventions reveal that domain-specific directions steer more effectively than domain-general ones. Finally, posttraining reshapes truth geometry, pushing sycophantic lying further from other truth types, suggesting representational basis for chat models sycophantic tendencies. Together, our results support the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: truth directions of varying generality coexist in representational space, with post-training reshaping their geometry.1 1Department of Psychology, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 2New York University, New York, NY 3Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 4Stanford University, Stanford, CA 5Schmidt Sciences, New York, NY. Correspondence to: Zhuofan Josh Ying <zy2559@columbia.edu>. Preprint. February 25, 2026. 1Code for all experiments is provided in https://github. com/zfying/truth spec. Large language models (LLMs) often generate false or misleading information that, by all appearances, they know to be untrue (Pan et al., 2023; Scheurer et al., 2023; Abdulhai et al., 2025). While we cannot always verify the truthfulness of model generations, we can probe them to detect when models themselves represent their generations to be false (Goldowsky-Dill et al., 2025). Therefore, understanding how LLMs internally represent truthfulness has become critical challenge for their safe deployment. Recent work suggests that LLMs develop linear representation of truthfulness that can be extracted via probing (Marks & Tegmark, 2023). If such representations are sufficiently general, they should enable reliable detection of model falsehoods regardless of domain, and potentially allow interventions to improve honesty (Li et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Turner et al., 2023; Cundy & Gleave, 2025; Ravfogel et al., 2025). Although some works show that these truth directions exhibit remarkable generalization across various domains and strategic deception scenarios (Burns et al., 2023; Azaria & Mitchell, 2023; Marks & Tegmark, 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Burger et al., 2024; Goldowsky-Dill et al., 2025), others show that probes fail to generalize in some cases and argue that LLMs encode multiple, distinct notions of truth (Levinstein & Herrmann, 2024; Sky et al., 2024; Azizian et al., 2025; Orgad et al., 2025). We argue that these seemingly contradictory findings can be reconciled. Prior work has treated cross-domain generalization failure and geometric dissimilarity between probes as evidence against domain-general truth encoding. However, this inference is flawed: generalization may fail not because domain-general directions do not exist, but because we fail to discover them. Conversely, high probe generalization performance and high probe direction similarity do not preclude the existence of highly domain-specific directions. We propose the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: rather than exhibiting either single domain-general truth direction or entirely separate domain-specific directions, LLMs encode truthfulness along spectrum of generality, with directions at varying levels of generality coexisting in the representational space (Figure 1). At one end lies fully domain-general direction; at the other, fully domain-specific directions share no common structure; in between, direcThe Truthfulness Spectrum Hypothesis Figure 1. Truth representations in LLMs are graded in generality and reshaped by post-training. Left: Different truth types share partially overlapping but distinct sets of truth directions. These directions lie on spectrum from domain-general to domain-specific. The geometry of truth representations changes through post-training, pushing sycophancy into more distant subspace from other truth types. This reorganization causes probes trained on factual truth to fail on sycophancy detection, and vice versa (X). However, training on all domains still yields domain-general direction (X). Right: Concept erasure analysis further reveals the full spectrum of truth directions. tions generalize across some domains but not others. probe trained on one domain may capture superposition of these directions, combining domain-specific and more general features. The distribution of models truth representations along this spectrum has important implications for lie detection and alignment interventions. Our experiments are based on our FLEED dataset, large set of carefully controlled truthfulness datasets spanning five fundamental truth types: definitional, empirical, logical, fictional, and ethical. We additionally construct two novel deception datasets: sycophantic lying dataset where models alter their answers to align with user-stated beliefs, and an expectation-inverted dataset where the user expects models to make false claims, making true generations violate the user expectation and count as lies. We also evaluate on prior honesty benchmarks (Scheurer et al., 2023; Benton et al., 2024; Goldowsky-Dill et al., 2025). Our findings support the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis. Linear probes generalize well across our five fundamental truth types and most honesty benchmarks, yet fail almost entirely on sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying (AUROC 0.55). At t"

Abstract Large language models contain truth directions ranging from domain-general to domain-specific in their representational space, with linear probes showing varying generalization capabilities and causal interventions revealing differential effectiveness of these directions.  					AI-generated summary Large language models (LLMs) have been reported to linearly encode truthfulness, yet recent work questions this finding's generality. We reconcile these views with the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: the representational space contains directions ranging from broadly domain-general to narrowly domain-specific. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate probe generalization across five truth types (definitional, empirical, logical, fictional, and ethical), sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying, and existing honesty benchmarks. Linear probes generalize well across most domains but fail on sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying. Yet training on all domains jointly recovers strong performance, confirming that domain-general directions exist despite poor pairwise transfer. The geometry of probe directions explains these patterns: Mahalanobis cosine similarity between probes near-perfectly predicts cross-domain generalization (R^2=0.98). Concept-erasure methods further isolate truth directions that are (1) domain-general, (2) domain-specific, or (3) shared only across particular domain subsets. Causal interventions reveal that domain-specific directions steer more effectively than domain-general ones. Finally, post-training reshapes truth geometry, pushing sycophantic lying further from other truth types, suggesting a representational basis for chat models' sycophantic tendencies. Together, our results support the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: truth directions of varying generality coexist in representational space, with post-training reshaping their geometry. Code for all experiments is provided in https://github.com/zfying/truth_spec.
