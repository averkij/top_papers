Text:"From Statics to Dynamics: Physics-Aware Image Editing with Latent Transition Priors Liangbing Zhao 1 Le Zhuo 2 3 Sayak Paul 4 Hongsheng Li 2 Mohamed Elhoseiny 1 6 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 8 7 7 1 2 . 2 0 6 2 : r aInstruction-based image editing has achieved in semantic alignment, remarkable success yet state-of-the-art models frequently fail to render physically plausible results when editing involves complex causal dynamics, such as refraction or material deformation. We attribute this limitation to the dominant paradigm that treats editing as discrete mapping between image pairs, which provides only boundary transition dynamics conditions and leaves underspecified. To address this, we reformulate physics-aware editing as predictive physical state transitions and introduce PhysicTran38K, large-scale video-based dataset comprising 38K transition trajectories across five physical domains, constructed via two-stage filtering and constraint-aware annotation pipeline. Building on this supervision, we propose PhysicEdit, an endto-end framework equipped with textual-visual dual-thinking mechanism. It combines frozen Qwen2.5-VL for physically grounded reasoning with learnable transition queries that provide timestep-adaptive visual guidance to diffusion backbone. Experiments show that PhysicEdit improves over Qwen-Image-Edit by 5.9% in physical realism and 10.1% in knowledgegrounded editing, setting new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, while remaining competitive with leading proprietary models.

Bridging semantic alignment and physical plausibility. (Top) Despite high semantic fidelity, existing editing models frequently violate physical principles. (Bottom) Traditional image editing treats editing as black box, learning discrete mapping with underspecified constraints. Our approach reformulates editing as Physical State Transition, leveraging continuous dynamics to constrain the state transition space from unreal hallucinations to physically valid trajectories. to do visual creation much more easily. As user demands evolve from simple style transfer or object replacement to more complex scenarios involving hypothetical or counterfactual changes, the focus has shifted toward reasoningbased editing (Huang et al., 2024; He et al., 2025; Zhuo et al., 2025b). This demand has contributed to the emergence of unified multi-modal models (UMMs), such as Bagel (Deng et al., 2025) and Nano Banana (Google, 2025), which leverage the inherent textual reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLMs) to bridge the gap between abstract user intent and visual execution. While these unified frameworks have established new backbone for image editing, their reasoning modules operate primarily at the semantic level rather than physical causality. Consequently, despite high semantic fidelity, state-of-the-art models frequently hallucinate artifacts that violate fundamental physical principles, as they prioritize object matching over physical plausibility. This drawback becomes particularly apparent in scenarios governed by strict physical interactions. Consider common scenario: inserting straw into transparent glass of water. As shown in Figure 1, while existing models can correctly Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2026 identify the object (straw) and the location (in the glass of water), they frequently fail to render the optical refraction phenomenon, where the straw should appear disjointed or bent at the water surface. Instead, they tend to generate naive straws position, maintaining geometric rigidity while violating optical physical laws. This discrepancy reveals fundamental limitation: current models maximize semantic alignment at the cost of physical plausibility. To bridge this gap, we argue that the next frontier in visual creation lies in physics-aware image editing: paradigm where generated content must rigidly adhere to the causal rules of the physical world. To achieve this goal, we propose fundamental shift in problem formulation: the editing process should not be viewed as static mapping between independent images, but rather as predictive physical state transition. Under this formulation, the source image represents an initial state, and the edit instruction specifies an external interaction or trigger that drives the scene toward subsequent state under physical laws. central challenge is that standard paired images supervision in image editing provides only boundary conditions, leaving the transition itself underspecified. By contrast, temporal sequences show intermediate evidence of how states evolve, making video natural source of supervision for learning transition priors. Therefore, we construct PhysicTran38K, large-scale video-based dataset tailored to physical state transitions. Unlike existing benchmarks that predominantly emphasize semantic operations (e.g., add/remove/replace), PhysicTran38K is organized around interaction-driven triggers and law-governed transitions. We design hierarchical physics categories covering five major physical domains, 16 intermediate sub-domains, and spanning 46 distinct transition types. By employing two-stage filtering pipeline, we finally get and annotate 38,000 highquality transition data, providing explicit supervision for how physical states evolve over time. However, leveraging video data introduces practical mismatch: while videos supervise training, intermediate states are unavailable during inference. We address this train-test discrepancy by introducing PhysicEdit, physics-aware editing framework built on Qwen-Image-Edit (Wu et al., 2025a) that learns from video trajectories while remaining compatible with the single-image inference workflow. We propose textual-visual dual-thinking mechanism that decouples physical understanding into two branches. First, physicallygrounded reasoning branch uses frozen Qwen2.5-VL7B (Bai et al., 2025) to produce structured physical constraints as textual context. Second, an implicit visual thinking branch introduces learnable transition queries that are trained to"

Abstract PhysicEdit enhances image editing by incorporating physical state transitions through a dual-thinking mechanism combining frozen vision-language models with learnable transition queries in a diffusion framework.  					AI-generated summary Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable success in semantic alignment, yet state-of-the-art models frequently fail to render physically plausible results when editing involves complex causal dynamics, such as refraction or material deformation. We attribute this limitation to the dominant paradigm that treats editing as a discrete mapping between image pairs, which provides only boundary conditions and leaves transition dynamics underspecified. To address this, we reformulate physics-aware editing as predictive physical state transitions and introduce PhysicTran38K, a large-scale video-based dataset comprising 38K transition trajectories across five physical domains, constructed via a two-stage filtering and constraint-aware annotation pipeline. Building on this supervision, we propose PhysicEdit, an end-to-end framework equipped with a textual-visual dual-thinking mechanism. It combines a frozen Qwen2.5-VL for physically grounded reasoning with learnable transition queries that provide timestep-adaptive visual guidance to a diffusion backbone. Experiments show that PhysicEdit improves over Qwen-Image-Edit by 5.9% in physical realism and 10.1% in knowledge-grounded editing, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, while remaining competitive with leading proprietary models.
