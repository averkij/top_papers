Text:"VecGlypher: Unified Vector Glyph Generation with Language Models Xiaoke Huang1,2,, Bhavul Gauri1, Kam Woh Ng1, Tony Ng1, Mengmeng Xu1, Zhiheng Liu1, Weiming Ren1, Zhaochong An1, Zijian Zhou1, Haonan Qiu1, Yuyin Zhou2, Sen He1, Ziheng Wang1, Tao Xiang1, Xiao Han1 1Meta AI, 2UC, Santa Cruz Work done at Meta Vector glyphs are the atomic units of digital typography, yet most learning-based pipelines still depend on carefully curated exemplar sheets and raster-to-vector postprocessing, which limits accessibility and editability. We introduce VecGlypher, single multimodal language model that generates high-fidelity vector glyphs directly from text descriptions or image exemplars. Given style prompts or reference glyph images, and target character, VecGlypher autoregressively emits SVG path tokens, avoiding raster intermediates and producing editable, watertight outlines in one pass. typography-aware data and training recipe makes this possible: (i) large-scale continuation stage on 39K noisy Envato fonts to master SVG syntax and long-horizon geometry, followed by (ii) posttraining on 2.5K expert-annotated Google Fonts with descriptive tags and exemplars to align language and imagery with geometry; preprocessing normalizes coordinate frames, canonicalizes paths, deduplicates families, and quantizes coordinates for stable long-sequence decoding. On cross-family OOD evaluation, VecGlypher substantially outperforms both general-purpose LLMs and specialized vector-font baselines for text-only generation, while image-referenced generation reaches state-ofthe-art performance, with marked gains over DeepVecFont-v2 and DualVector. Ablations show that model scale and the two-stage recipe are critical and that absolute-coordinate serialization yields the best geometry. VecGlypher lowers the barrier to font creation by letting users design with words or exemplars, and provides scalable foundation for future multimodal design tools.

AI-generated summary Vector glyphs are the atomic units of digital typography, yet most learning-based pipelines still depend on carefully curated exemplar sheets and raster-to-vector postprocessing, which limits accessibility and editability. We introduce VecGlypher, a single multimodal language model that generates high-fidelity vector glyphs directly from text descriptions or image exemplars. Given a style prompt, optional reference glyph images, and a target character, VecGlypher autoregressively emits SVG path tokens, avoiding raster intermediates and producing editable, watertight outlines in one pass. A typography-aware data and training recipe makes this possible: (i) a large-scale continuation stage on 39K noisy Envato fonts to master SVG syntax and long-horizon geometry, followed by (ii) post-training on 2.5K expert-annotated Google Fonts with descriptive tags and exemplars to align language and imagery with geometry; preprocessing normalizes coordinate frames, canonicalizes paths, de-duplicates families, and quantizes coordinates for stable long-sequence decoding. On cross-family OOD evaluation, VecGlypher substantially outperforms both general-purpose LLMs and specialized vector-font baselines for text-only generation, while image-referenced generation reaches a state-of-the-art performance, with marked gains over DeepVecFont-v2 and DualVector. Ablations show that model scale and the two-stage recipe are critical and that absolute-coordinate serialization yields the best geometry. VecGlypher lowers the barrier to font creation by letting users design with words or exemplars, and provides a scalable foundation for future multimodal design tools.

  "desc": "VecGlypher — это мультимодальная языковая модель, которая генерирует векторные глифы высокого качества прямо из текстовых описаний или изображений, минуя традиционные процессы растеризации. Модель автарегрессивно производит токены SVG-путей, создавая редактируемые контуры в один проход без промежуточных растровых представлений. Авторы использовали специальный рецепт обучения: предварительное обучение на 39 тысячах шрифтов с целью овладения синтаксисом SVG, затем дополнительное обучение на 2,5 тысячах аннотированных шрифтов Google для выравнивания языка и изображений с геометрией. Модель существенно превосходит как универсальные LLM, так и специализированные базовые модели при генерации из текста и достигает лучших результатов при генерации из изображений.",
