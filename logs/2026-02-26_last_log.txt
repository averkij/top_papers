This gap stems from two limitations in the open-source ecosystem: shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often hurts grounding accuracy, and (ii) step-wise RLVR-tyle training faces partial verifiability, where multiple actions can be correct at given state but only single demonstrated action is used for verification. This causes reward ambiguity and makes offline step-wise metrics weak predictors of online task success during RL training. In this work, we present GUI-Libra, systematic study and tailored training recipe that addresses these challenges. First, to mitigate the scarcity of action-aligned reasoning data, we introduce data construction and filtering pipeline and release curated 81K GUI reasoning dataset. Second, to reconcile reasoning with grounding, we propose action-aware supervised fine-tuning that mixes reasoning-then-action and direct-action supervision, and reweights tokens to emphasize action and grounding. Third, to stabilize RL under partial verifiability, we identify the overlooked importance of KL regularization and show, both theoretically and empirically, that "

Text:"NanoKnow: How to Know What Your Language Model Knows Nour Jedidi University of Waterloo Waterloo, ON, Canada njedidi@uwaterloo.ca Lingwei Gu University of Waterloo Waterloo, ON, Canada lingwei.gu@uwaterloo.ca Jimmy Lin University of Waterloo Waterloo, ON, Canada jimmylin@uwaterloo.ca 6 2 0 2 3 2 ] . [ 1 2 2 1 0 2 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract How do large language models (LLMs) know what they know? Answering this question has been difficult because pre-training data is often black box unknown or inaccessible. The recent release of nanochat family of small LLMs with fully open pretraining data addresses this as it provides transparent view into where models parametric knowledge comes from. Towards the goal of understanding how knowledge is encoded by LLMs, we release NanoKnow, benchmark dataset that partitions questions from Natural Questions and SQuAD into splits based on whether their answers are present in nanochats pre-training corpus. Using these splits, we can now properly disentangle the sources of knowledge that LLMs rely on when producing an output. To demonstrate NanoKnows utility, we conduct experiments using eight nanochat checkpoints. Our findings show: (1) closed-book accuracy is strongly influenced by answer frequency in the pretraining data, (2) providing external evidence can mitigate this frequency dependence, (3) even with external evidence, models are more accurate when answers were seen during pre-training, demonstrating that parametric and external knowledge are complementary, and (4) non-relevant information is harmful, with accuracy decreasing based on both the position and the number of non-relevant contexts. We release all NanoKnow artifacts at https://github.com/castorini/NanoKnow. Knowledge expressed by LLMs can originate from various, potentially entangled, sources. There exists knowledge stored within their parameters [19], which can be probed via closed-book question answering [8], but this only tells us what LLMs know, not necessarily how tha"

Abstract GUI-Libra addresses limitations in open-source GUI agents through specialized training methods that improve reasoning-grounding alignment and reinforcement learning under partial verifiability, demonstrating enhanced task completion across web and mobile platforms.  					AI-generated summary Open-source native GUI agents still lag behind closed-source systems on long-horizon navigation tasks. This gap stems from two limitations: a shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard SFT with CoT reasoning often hurts grounding, and (ii) step-wise RLVR-tyle training faces partial verifiability, where multiple actions can be correct but only a single demonstrated action is used for verification. This makes offline step-wise metrics weak predictors of online task success. In this work, we present GUI-Libra, a tailored training recipe that addresses these challenges. First, to mitigate the scarcity of action-aligned reasoning data, we introduce a data construction and filtering pipeline and release a curated 81K GUI reasoning dataset. Second, to reconcile reasoning with grounding, we propose action-aware SFT that mixes reasoning-then-action and direct-action data and reweights tokens to emphasize action and grounding. Third, to stabilize RL under partial verifiability, we identify the overlooked importance of KL regularization in RLVR and show that a KL trust region is critical for improving offline-to-online predictability; we further introduce success-adaptive scaling to downweight unreliable negative gradients. Across diverse web and mobile benchmarks, GUI-Libra consistently improves both step-wise accuracy and end-to-end task completion. Our results suggest that carefully designed post-training and data curation can unlock significantly stronger task-solving capabilities without costly online data collection. We release our dataset, code, and models to facilitate further research on data-efficient post-training for reasoning-capable GUI agents.

"Abstract GUI-Libra addresses limitations in open-source GUI agents through specialized training methods that improve reasoning-grounding alignment and reinforcement learning under partial verifiability, demonstrating enhanced task completion across web and mobile platforms.  					AI-generated summary Open-source native GUI agents still lag behind closed-source systems on long-horizon navigation tasks. This gap stems from two limitations: a shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard SFT with CoT reasoning often hurts grounding, and (ii) step-wise RLVR-tyle training faces partial verifiability, where multiple actions can be correct but only a single demonstrated action is used for verification. This makes offline step-wise metrics weak predictors of online task success. In this work, we present GUI-Libra, a tailored training recipe that addresses these challenges. First, to mitigate the scarcity of action-aligned reasoning data, we introduce a data construction and filtering pipeline and release a curated 81K GUI reasoning dataset. Second, to reconcile reasoning with grounding, we propose action-aware SFT that mixes reasoning-then-action and direct-action data and reweights tokens to emphasize action and grounding. Third, to stabilize RL under partial verifiability, we identify the overlooked importance of KL regularization in RLVR and show that a KL trust region is critical for improving offline-to-online predictability; we further introduce success-adaptive scaling to downweight unreliable negative gradients. Across diverse web and mobile benchmarks, GUI-Libra consistently improves both step-wise accuracy and end-to-end task completion. Our results suggest that carefully designed post-training and data curation can unlock significantly stronger task-solving capabilities without costly online data collection. We release our dataset, code, and models to facilitate further research on data-efficient post-training for reasoning-capable GUI agents."

Abstract NanoKnow benchmark enables analysis of knowledge sources in LLMs by partitioning questions based on pre-training data presence, revealing how parametric and external knowledge interact in model responses.  					AI-generated summary How do large language models (LLMs) know what they know? Answering this question has been difficult because pre-training data is often a "black box" -- unknown or inaccessible. The recent release of nanochat -- a family of small LLMs with fully open pre-training data -- addresses this as it provides a transparent view into where a model's parametric knowledge comes from. Towards the goal of understanding how knowledge is encoded by LLMs, we release NanoKnow, a benchmark dataset that partitions questions from Natural Questions and SQuAD into splits based on whether their answers are present in nanochat's pre-training corpus. Using these splits, we can now properly disentangle the sources of knowledge that LLMs rely on when producing an output. To demonstrate NanoKnow's utility, we conduct experiments using eight nanochat checkpoints. Our findings show: (1) closed-book accuracy is strongly influenced by answer frequency in the pre-training data, (2) providing external evidence can mitigate this frequency dependence, (3) even with external evidence, models are more accurate when answers were seen during pre-training, demonstrating that parametric and external knowledge are complementary, and (4) non-relevant information is harmful, with accuracy decreasing based on both the position and the number of non-relevant contexts. We release all NanoKnow artifacts at https://github.com/castorini/NanoKnow.

Используя открытые данные предобучения семейства моделей nanochat, авторы исследуют, как параметрические знания (закодированные в весах модели) и внешние знания (из контекста) взаимодействуют при генерации ответов. Экспериментальные результаты показывают, что точность закрытого типа вопросов сильно зависит от частоты ответов в обучающих данных, но внешние доказательства могут снизить эту зависимость. При этом параметрические и внешние знания являются дополняющими друг друга источниками информации, и наличие нерелевантной информации негативно влияет на качество ответов модели.",
