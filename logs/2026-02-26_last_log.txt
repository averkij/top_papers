Text:"6 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 8 4 5 1 2 . 2 0 6 2 : r DualPath: Breaking the Storage Bandwidth Bottleneck in Agentic LLM Inference Yongtong Wu1,3 Shaoyuan Chen2,3 Yinmin Zhong1,3 Rilin Huang1 Yixuan Tan3 Wentao Zhang3 Liyue Zhang3 Shangyan Zhou3 Yuxuan Liu3 Shunfeng Zhou3 Mingxing Zhang2 Xin Jin1 Panpan Huang3 1School of Computer Science, Peking University 2Tsinghua University 3DeepSeek-AI ABSTRACT The performance of multi-turn, agentic LLM inference is increasingly dominated by KV-Cache storage I/O rather than computation. In prevalent disaggregated architectures, loading the massive KV-Cache from external storage creates fundamental imbalance: storage NICs on prefill engines become bandwidth-saturated, while those on decoding engines remain idle. This asymmetry severely constrains overall system throughput. We present DualPath, an inference system that breaks this bottleneck by introducing dual-path KV-Cache loading. Beyond the traditional storage-to-prefill path, DualPath enables novel storage-to-decode path, in which the KV-Cache is loaded into decoding engines and then efficiently transferred to prefill engines via RDMA over the compute network. DualPath combines this optimized data path which inherently avoids network congestion and avoids interference with latency-critical model execution communications with global scheduler that dynamically balances load across prefill and decode engines. Our evaluation on three models with production agentic workloads demonstrates that DualPath improves offline inference throughput by up to 1.87 on our in-house inference system. It can also improve online serving throughput by an average factor of 1.96 without violating SLO. Figure 1: Existing bottleneck (left) and DualPath (right). This paradigm shift in applications has driven significant transformation in LLM inference workloads: from traditional human-LLM interaction to human-LLM-environment interaction, called the agentic paradigm. The typical pattern of human-model interaction "

Text:"Yor-Sarc: gold-standard dataset for sarcasm detection in low-resource African language Toheeb A. Jimoh 1, Tabea De Wille 1, and Nikola S. Nikolov 1 1Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, University of Limerick, Castletroy, V94 T9PX, Limerick, Ireland Abstract Sarcasm detection poses fundamental challenge in computational semantics, requiring models to resolve disparities between literal and intended meaning. The challenge is amplified in lowresource languages where annotated datasets are scarce or nonexistent. We present Yor-Sarc, the first gold-standard dataset for sarcasm detection in Yor`uba, tonal Niger-Congo language spoken by over 50 million people. The dataset comprises 436 instances annotated by three native speakers from diverse dialectal backgrounds using an annotation protocol specifically designed for Yor`uba sarcasm by taking culture into account. This protocol incorporates context-sensitive interpretation and community-informed guidelines and is accompanied by comprehensive analysis of inter-annotator agreement to support replication in other African languages. Substantial to almost perfect agreement was achieved (Fleiss κ = 0.7660; pairwise Cohens κ = 0.67320.8743), with 83.3% unanimous consensus. One annotator pair achieved almost perfect agreement (κ = 0.8743; 93.8% raw agreement), exceeding number of reported benchmarks for English sarcasm research works. The remaining 16.7% majority-agreement cases are preserved as soft labels for uncertaintyaware modelling. Yor-Sarc1 is expected to facilitate research on semantic interpretation and culturally informed NLP for low-resource African languages.

Abstract MolHIT presents a hierarchical discrete diffusion model for molecular graph generation that achieves superior chemical validity and property-guided synthesis compared to existing 1D and graph-based approaches.  					AI-generated summary Molecular generation with diffusion models has emerged as a promising direction for AI-driven drug discovery and materials science. While graph diffusion models have been widely adopted due to the discrete nature of 2D molecular graphs, existing models suffer from low chemical validity and struggle to meet the desired properties compared to 1D modeling. In this work, we introduce MolHIT, a powerful molecular graph generation framework that overcomes long-standing performance limitations in existing methods. MolHIT is based on the Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model, which generalizes discrete diffusion to additional categories that encode chemical priors, and decoupled atom encoding that splits the atom types according to their chemical roles. Overall, MolHIT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSES dataset with near-perfect validity for the first time in graph diffusion, surpassing strong 1D baselines across multiple metrics. We further demonstrate strong performance in downstream tasks, including multi-property guided generation and scaffold extension.

Abstract DualPath addresses KV-cache storage I/O bottlenecks in multi-turn LLM inference by introducing dual-path loading and dynamic load balancing across prefill and decode engines.  					AI-generated summary The performance of multi-turn, agentic LLM inference is increasingly dominated by KV-Cache storage I/O rather than computation. In prevalent disaggregated architectures, loading the massive KV-Cache from external storage creates a fundamental imbalance: storage NICs on prefill engines become bandwidth-saturated, while those on decoding engines remain idle. This asymmetry severely constrains overall system throughput.   We present DualPath, an inference system that breaks this bottleneck by introducing dual-path KV-Cache loading. Beyond the traditional storage-to-prefill path, DualPath enables a novel storage-to-decode path, in which the KV-Cache is loaded into decoding engines and then efficiently transferred to prefill engines via RDMA over the compute network. DualPath combines this optimized data path -- which inherently avoids network congestion and avoids interference with latency-critical model execution communications -- with a global scheduler that dynamically balances load across prefill and decode engines.   Our evaluation on three models with production agentic workloads demonstrates that DualPath improves offline inference throughput by up to 1.87times on our in-house inference system. It can also improve online serving throughput by an average factor of 1.96times without violating SLO.

Abstract A new gold-standard dataset for sarcasm detection in Yorùbá is introduced with high inter-annotator agreement and soft labels for uncertainty-aware modeling.  					AI-generated summary Sarcasm detection poses a fundamental challenge in computational semantics, requiring models to resolve disparities between literal and intended meaning. The challenge is amplified in low-resource languages where annotated datasets are scarce or nonexistent. We present Yor-Sarc, the first gold-standard dataset for sarcasm detection in Yorùbá, a tonal Niger-Congo language spoken by over 50 million people. The dataset comprises 436 instances annotated by three native speakers from diverse dialectal backgrounds using an annotation protocol specifically designed for Yorùbá sarcasm by taking culture into account. This protocol incorporates context-sensitive interpretation and community-informed guidelines and is accompanied by a comprehensive analysis of inter-annotator agreement to support replication in other African languages. Substantial to almost perfect agreement was achieved (Fleiss' κ= 0.7660; pairwise Cohen's κ= 0.6732--0.8743), with 83.3% unanimous consensus. One annotator pair achieved almost perfect agreement (κ= 0.8743; 93.8% raw agreement), exceeding a number of reported benchmarks for English sarcasm research works. The remaining 16.7% majority-agreement cases are preserved as soft labels for uncertainty-aware modelling. Yor-Sarchttps://github.com/toheebadura/yor-sarc is expected to facilitate research on semantic interpretation and culturally informed NLP for low-resource African languages.

Авторы разработали специально адаптированный протокол аннотирования, учитывающий культурные особенности и контекстные интерпретации йоруба, достигнув высокого согласия между аннотаторами (κ = 0.7660 по Fleiss, 83.3% полного консенсуса). Для оставшихся случаев с неполным согласием используются мягкие метки (soft labels), которые позволяют моделям учитывать неопределённость при обучении. Этот датасет служит фундаментом для развития семантически чувствительных NLP-систем и culturally-informed моделей для низкоресурсных африканских языков.",
