[ 1 0 3 0 5 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aWe introduce the Sphere Encoder, an efficient generative framework capable of producing images in single forward pass and competing with manystep diffusion models using fewer than five steps. Our approach works by learning an encoder that maps natural images uniformly onto spherical latent space, and decoder that maps random latent vectors back to the image space. Trained solely through image reconstruction losses, the model generates an image by simply decoding random point on the sphere. Our architecture naturally supports conditional generation, and looping the encoder/decoder few times can further enhance image quality. Across several datasets, the sphere encoder approach yields performance competitive with state of the art diffusions, but with small fraction of the inference cost. Project page is available at sphere-encoder.github.io. 1. Introduction Most generative image models rely on either diffusion (Ho et al., 2020; Lipman et al., 2022) or autoregressive nexttoken prediction (Tian et al., 2024). With either paradigm, image generation is extremely slow and costly, requiring many forward passes to produce single image. We propose an alternative paradigm that is capable of generating sharp images with as little as one forward pass. Our approach, which we call sphere encoder, works by training two complementary models: an encoder model that maps the distribution of natural images uniformly onto the sphere, and decoder that maps points on the sphere back to natural images (Figure 2). The term aligns with the autoencoder convention, reflecting its encoder-decoder architecture. At test time, an image is generated quickly by sampling random point on the sphere and passing it through the decoder. Although the sphere encoder does not employ diffusion processes explicitly, it supports several key capabilities commonly associated with its diffusion-based cousins (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Rombach et al., 2022; Esser et al., 2024). Equal contribution. 1Meta 2University of Maryland. Figure 1. Selected images generated by the Sphere Encoder in one-step for CIFAR-10 (32 32) and Animal-Faces, two-steps for Oxford-Flowers, and four-steps for ImageNet (256 256). These include conditional generation using AdaLN (Perez et al., 2018; Peebles & Xie, 2023), classifier-free guidance (CFG) (Ho & Salimans, 2022), and few-step iteration to enhance sample quality (Goodfellow et al., 2014; KingmaFigure 2. sphere encoder maps the natural image distribution uniformly onto global sphere S. The decoder then generates realistic image by decoding random point on the sphere. & Dhariwal, 2018; Song et al., 2023). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive one-step generation, and state-of-the-art performance in few-step regimes (e.g., fewer than 5 steps) on range of datasets.Autoencoders (LeCun, 1987; Bourlard & Kamp, 1988; Hinton & Zemel, 1993) have been widely used in representation learning and generative modeling. lower-dimensional latent bottleneck between the encoder and decoder forces the model to learn an undercomplete representation of the input (Goodfellow et al., 2016). To regularize the latent space, variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2013; 2019; Tolstikhin et al., 2018; Davidson et al., 2018; Ke & Xue, 2025) minimize the divergence between the latent distribution and (typically) Gaussian prior. Unfortunately, in the standard VAE formulation, the divergence loss and image reconstruction loss are at odds with one another; zero divergence loss cannot be achieved simultaneously with perfect image reconstruction. As result, the learned posterior fails to strongly match the prior an issue known as the posterior hole problem (Makhzani et al., 2015; Rezende & Viola, 2018; Tomczak & Welling, 2018; Dai & Wipf, 2019; Ghosh et al., 2020; Aneja et al., 2021). Direct samples from the Gaussian prior fail to yield valid images. Realistic images are currently possible only by decoding samples from the posterior (i.e., adding noise to latents derived from real images), as illustrated in Figure 3. Our approach does not suffer from this problem. Like classical VAE, our approach relies on an autoencoder. Unlike the VAE, which tries to force the latent vectors into Gaussian distribution, we instead force latents to be uniformly distributed on sphere. Due to the bounded and rotationally symmetric nature of the sphere, this can be achieved simply by forcing embeddings of natural images away from one another, causing them to spread throughout the sphere. Moreover, this objective is not in contradiction with the image reconstruction objective; we can achieve 2 Figure 3. Posterior hole problem in VAEs. Columns: (1) Input images; (2) Autoencoder reconstructions; (3) Samples from standard Gaussian prior; and (4) Samples from estimated Gaussian posterior on Animal-Faces training set. Unlike modern FLUX.1/2 (Labs et al., 2025) and SD-VAE (Podell et al., 2024), our sphere encoder produces realistic images by decoding random points sampled from the sphere. both uniformity and accurate reconstruction simultaneously. Many contemporary state-of-the-art diffusion models are actually latent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022; Peebles & Xie, 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2024; Esser et al., 2024; Podell et al., 2024; Wan et al., 2025) hybrid models built on top of VAEs. The VAE partially Gaussianizes the image distribution, but not well enough to be sampled. diffusion pipeline picks up the slack in the VAE, going the last mile of producing valid latent sample for the decoder. Concurrent works have shown that more powerful representation encoders (Yu et al., 2024; Tong et al., 2026), and even spherical manifold encoders (Zheng et al., 2025), result in faster training of the diffusion layer. In our work, we show that spherical latent space1 can be learned so precisely that the expensive diffusion step is irrelevant. 2. Method 2.1. Spherical Latent Space We employ an encoder based on Transformer (Dosovitskiy, 2020; Vaswani et al., 2017) to map an input image RHW 3 into latent representation Rhwd. The latent resolution is determined by the patch size , such that = H/P and = W/P , with denoting the channel depth. To construct global spherical latent space, we define spherifying function, denoted as . This function flattens into vector of dimension = and then projects 1In contrast to prior vMF-bas"

Abstract The Sphere Encoder is an efficient generative model that produces images in a single forward pass by mapping images to a spherical latent space and decoding from random points on that sphere, achieving diffusion-like quality with significantly reduced inference costs.  					AI-generated summary We introduce the Sphere Encoder, an efficient generative framework capable of producing images in a single forward pass and competing with many-step diffusion models using fewer than five steps. Our approach works by learning an encoder that maps natural images uniformly onto a spherical latent space, and a decoder that maps random latent vectors back to the image space. Trained solely through image reconstruction losses, the model generates an image by simply decoding a random point on the sphere. Our architecture naturally supports conditional generation, and looping the encoder/decoder a few times can further enhance image quality. Across several datasets, the sphere encoder approach yields performance competitive with state of the art diffusions, but with a small fraction of the inference cost.

**Justification:**

- **DIFFUSION**: The paper explicitly discusses a generative model that competes with diffusion models and achieves "diffusion-like quality." The core contribution is an alternative to diffusion-based image generation.

- **OPTIMIZATION**: The paper focuses on reducing inference costs and computational efficiency ("significantly reduced inference costs," "fewer than five steps," "small fraction of the inference cost"), which is a key optimization concern for generative models.

Abstract Spectral-Evolution-Aware Cache (SeaCache) improves diffusion model inference speed by using spectrally aligned representations to optimize intermediate output reuse, achieving better latency-quality trade-offs than previous methods.  					AI-generated summary Diffusion models are a strong backbone for visual generation, but their inherently sequential denoising process leads to slow inference. Previous methods accelerate sampling by caching and reusing intermediate outputs based on feature distances between adjacent timesteps. However, existing caching strategies typically rely on raw feature differences that entangle content and noise. This design overlooks spectral evolution, where low-frequency structure appears early and high-frequency detail is refined later. We introduce Spectral-Evolution-Aware Cache (SeaCache), a training-free cache schedule that bases reuse decisions on a spectrally aligned representation. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we derive a Spectral-Evolution-Aware (SEA) filter that preserves content-relevant components while suppressing noise. Employing SEA-filtered input features to estimate redundancy leads to dynamic schedules that adapt to content while respecting the spectral priors underlying the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on diverse visual generative models and the baselines show that SeaCache achieves state-of-the-art latency-quality trade-offs.
