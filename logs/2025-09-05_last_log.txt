Text:"Video-MTR: Reinforced Multi-Turn Reasoning for Long Video Understanding Yuan Xie1,3, Tianshui Chen2*, Zheng Ge3, Lionel Ni1 1The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) 2Guangdong University of Technology 3StepFun AI yxie688@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn tianshuichen@gmail.com 5 2 0 2 8 2 ] . [ 1 8 7 4 0 2 . 8 0 5 2 : r Abstract Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal dependencies and multiple events, remains challenge. Existing methods often rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose VideoMTR, reinforced multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning pipeline, which generate predictions in single turn, Video-MTR performs reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current question. This iterative process allows for more refined and contextually aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we introduce novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU, and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video understanding. Introduction As foundational computer vision task, video understanding finds widespread applications in numerous domains, ranging from intelligent surveillance, content-based retrieval, to autonomous driving. With the explosive grow"
