Abstract Generating high-fidelity human videos that match userspecified identities is important yet challenging in the field of generative AI. Existing methods often rely on an excessive number of training parameters and lack compatibility with other AIGC tools. In this paper, we propose StandIn, lightweight and plug-and-play framework for identity preservation in video generation.

Identity control is achieved through restricted self-attentions with conditional position mapping, and can be learned quickly with only 2000 pairs.

An Empirical Study Mahdi Dhaini (cid:0)[0000000278313141], Juraj Vladika[0000000249419166], Ege Erdogan[0000000161703541], Zineb Attaoui[0009000339909588], and Gjergji Kasneci[0000000231237268] Technical University of Munich, School of Computation, Information and Technology, Department of Computer Science, Munich, Germany firstname.lastname@tum.de Abstract. In the rapidly evolving field of Explainable Natural Language Processing (NLP), textual explanations, i.e., human-like rationales, are pivotal for explaining model predictions and enriching datasets with interpretable labels. Traditional approaches rely on human annotation, which is costly, labor-intensive, and impedes scalability. In this work, we present an automated framework that leverages multiple state-ofthe-art large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality textual explanations. We rigorously assess the quality of these LLM-generated explanations using comprehensive suite of Natural Language Generation (NLG) metrics. Furthermore, we investigate the downstream impact of these explanations on the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and LLMs across natural language inference tasks on two diverse benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that automated explanations exhibit highly competitive effectiveness compared to human-annotated explanations in improving model performance. Our findings underscore promising avenue for scalable, automated LLMbased textual explanation generation for extending NLP datasets and enhancing model performance. Keywords: Explainable natural language processing Natural language explanations Natural language inference Large language models. Recent NLP advancements are driven by PLMs and LLMs, achieving state-ofthe-art results across various tasks [2]. However, their black-box nature limits understanding of their predictions, prompting"

Automated generation of textual explanations using large language models improves model performance in natural language inference tasks, offering a scalable alternative to human annotation.  					AI-generated summary 				 In the rapidly evolving field of Explainable Natural Language Processing (NLP), textual explanations, i.e., human-like rationales, are pivotal for explaining model predictions and enriching datasets with interpretable labels. Traditional approaches rely on human annotation, which is costly, labor-intensive, and impedes scalability. In this work, we present an automated framework that leverages multiple state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality textual explanations. We rigorously assess the quality of these LLM-generated explanations using a comprehensive suite of Natural Language Generation (NLG) metrics. Furthermore, we investigate the downstream impact of these explanations on the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and LLMs across natural language inference tasks on two diverse benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that automated explanations exhibit highly competitive effectiveness compared to human-annotated explanations in improving model performance. Our findings underscore a promising avenue for scalable, automated LLM-based textual explanation generation for extending NLP datasets and enhancing model performance.
