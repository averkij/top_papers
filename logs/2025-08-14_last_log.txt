Text:"5 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 3 1 1 8 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r AimBot: Simple Auxiliary Visual Cue to Enhance Spatial Awareness of Visuomotor Policies Yinpei Dai, Jayjun Lee, Yichi Zhang, Ziqiao Ma, Jianing Yang Amir Zadeh, Chuan Li, Nima Fazeli, Joyce Chai Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Michigan Robotics Department, University of Michigan Lambda Labs Equal Contribution Equal Advising {daiyp, jayjun, nfz, chaijy}@umich.edu Abstract: In this paper, we propose AimBot, lightweight visual augmentation technique that provides explicit spatial cues to improve visuomotor policy learning in robotic manipulation. AimBot overlays shooting lines and scope reticles onto multi-view RGB images, offering auxiliary visual guidance that encodes the endeffectors state. The overlays are computed from depth images, camera extrinsics, and the current end-effector pose, explicitly conveying spatial relationships between the gripper and objects in the scene. AimBot incurs minimal computational overhead (less than 1 ms) and requires no changes to model architectures, as it simply replaces original RGB images with augmented counterparts. Despite its simplicity, our results show that AimBot consistently improves the performance of various visuomotor policies in both simulation and real-world settings, highlighting the benefits of spatially grounded visual feedback. Codes and videos can be found at https://aimbot-reticle.github.io/ Keywords: Robotic Manipulation, Visuomotor Policy, Imitation Learning Figure 1: Overview of AimBot, lightweight visual guidance method that adds spatial cues onto RGB images for visuomotor policy learning. Given the robots end-effector pose, camera extrinsic and depth image, AimBot computes shooting lines and reticle overlay to highlight the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects of interest. The augmented RGB images are used as input to visuomotor policies for closed-loop control, enhancing task performance with minimal overhead. Robotic man"

AimBot, a lightweight visual augmentation technique, improves visuomotor policy learning in robotic manipulation by overlaying spatial cues onto RGB images, enhancing performance in both simulation and real-world settings.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we propose AimBot, a lightweight visual augmentation technique that provides explicit spatial cues to improve visuomotor policy learning in robotic manipulation. AimBot overlays shooting lines and scope reticles onto multi-view RGB images, offering auxiliary visual guidance that encodes the end-effector's state. The overlays are computed from depth images, camera extrinsics, and the current end-effector pose, explicitly conveying spatial relationships between the gripper and objects in the scene. AimBot incurs minimal computational overhead (less than 1 ms) and requires no changes to model architectures, as it simply replaces original RGB images with augmented counterparts. Despite its simplicity, our results show that AimBot consistently improves the performance of various visuomotor policies in both simulation and real-world settings, highlighting the benefits of spatially grounded visual feedback.

AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we propose AimBot, a lightweight visual augmentation technique that provides explicit spatial cues to improve visuomotor policy learning in robotic manipulation. AimBot overlays shooting lines and scope reticles onto multi-view RGB images, offering auxiliary visual guidance that encodes the end-effector's state. The overlays are computed from depth images, camera extrinsics, and the current end-effector pose, explicitly conveying spatial relationships between the gripper and objects in the scene. AimBot incurs minimal computational overhead (less than 1 ms) and requires no changes to model architectures, as it simply replaces original RGB images with augmented counterparts. Despite its simplicity, our results show that AimBot consistently improves the performance of various visuomotor policies in both simulation and real-world settings, highlighting the benefits of spatially grounded visual feedback."

StableAvatar, an end-to-end video diffusion transformer, synthesizes infinite-length high-quality audio-driven avatar videos with natural synchronization and identity consistency using a Time-step-aware Audio Adapter and Audio Native Guidance Mechanism.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to synthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity consistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video diffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos without post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio, StableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable infinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing existing models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They typically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio embeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via cross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related priors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation across video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to drift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this, StableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents error accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose a novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio synchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the infinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy that fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.
