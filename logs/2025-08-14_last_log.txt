Text:"ASM-UNet: Adaptive Scan Mamba Integrating Group Commonalities and Individual Variations for Fine-Grained Segmentation Bo Wang, Mengyuan Xu, Yue Yan, Yuqun Yang*, Member, IEEE, Kechen Shu, Wei Ping, Xu Tang, Senior Member, IEEE, Wei Jiang, Zheng You 1 5 2 0 2 0 1 ] . [ 1 7 3 2 7 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r aPrecise lesion resection depends on accurately identifying fine-grained anatomical structures. While many coarse-grained segmentation (CGS) methods have been successful in large-scale segmentation (e.g., organs), they fall short in clinical scenarios requiring fine-grained segmentation (FGS), which remains challenging due to frequent individual variations in small-scale anatomical structures. Although recent Mamba-based models have advanced medical image segmentation, they often rely on fixed manually-defined scanning orders, which limit their adaptability to individual variations in FGS. To address this, we propose ASM-UNet, novel Mamba-based architecture for FGS. It introduces adaptive scan scores to dynamically guide the scanning order, generated by combining group-level commonalities and individual-level variations. Experiments on two public datasets (ACDC and Synapse) and newly proposed challenging biliary tract FGS dataset, namely BTMS, demonstrate that ASM-UNet achieves superior performance in both CGS and FGS tasks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/YqunYang/ASM-UNet. Medical image segmentation, Mamba, fine-grained segmentation, anatomical variations.I. INTRODUCTION REcently, precise resection of the lesion has garnered increasing attention, with the goal of completely removing the lesion while preserving as much healthy tissue as possible. This approach promotes faster and more effective postoperative recovery and reduces the risk of long-term complications [1], [2]. To enable precise resection, artificial intelligence technology is employed to automatically segment medical images and construct 3D models, assisting clinicians in accurately identifying the optimal starting point for resection and predicting the extent of lesion and surrounding vessels [3][5]. This ultimately facilitates greater surgical precision in the resection of the lesion. In CT image segmentation of organs such as the heart, liver, and lungs, the large size of the imaging area contributes to high segmentation accuracy in terms of total volume [6][8]. This supports surgical planning for resection procedures involving larger anatomical regions. However, such coarse-grained segmentation (CGS) is insufficient for precise resection. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, the biliary tract system can be further refined into multiple anatomical structures. During gallbladder resection, it is crucial to accurately distinguish the common hepatic duct (CHD), right hepatic duct (RHD), and common bile duct (CBD) at fine-grained level to prevent surgical errors. Therefore, achieving accurate fine-grained segmentation (FGS) of medical images has become critical topic in precision surgery. Nevertheless, individual anatomical variation remains major challenge in FGS. As illustrated in the left part of Fig. 2, group-level commonality, such as the general distribution patterns of most organs, is consistently observed across individuals of different ages and sexes, which facilitates large-scale CGS. In contrast, when the anatomical scale is reduced from the entire thoracoabdominal cavity to single organs or functional systems, inter-individual differences become more pronounced. Taking the biliary system as Corresponding author: Yuqun Yang (email: yqunyang@163.com). 2 Fig. 1. Illustration of fine-grained anatomical structures within the biliary tract system under the coarse-grained organ segmentation. It consists of multiple anatomical structures, including gallbladder (GB), cystic duct (CD) and others. The definitions of all abbreviations are provided in Table I. Illustration of six common anatomical variants of the biliary tract system. Beyond these, numerous undefined variants also occur in Fig. 2. clinical practice. an example, it can be classified into six common types [9], [10], as shown in the right part of Fig. 2, along with other undefined variants. These variations correspond to different distributions of anatomical structures such as RHD and CHD, which are critical components for precise resection. Moreover, such variations often occur at small anatomical scale. For example, the CHD typically has diameter of less than 10 mm. Therefore, although achieving accurate FGS is essential for precision surgery, it remains challenging task due to significant individual anatomical variations. Among the various approaches proposed for medical image segmentation, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models have become the dominant paradigm [11]. In particular, U-Net [12] and its variants [13][15] have achieved encouraging performance, benefiting from their encoderdecoder architecture and multi-scale feature fusion. However, CNNs inherently struggle to capture long-range dependencies, 3 limiting their effectiveness in segmenting complex anatomical structures. To address this issue, researchers have introduced the Transformer architecture [16]. With its self-attention mechanism, the Transformer excels at modeling global context and long-range dependencies, making it particularly well-suited for tasks that require holistic understanding of medical images [17]. As result, many Transformer-involved methods [18][20] have been proposed, achieving promising accuracy across variety of medical image segmentation tasks. Recently, to address the high computational complexity of Transformers, which scales quadratically with input length (O(n2)), Mamba [21] has been introduced. Mamba leverages selective state space model (SSM) and linear-time (O(n)) operations, enabling efficient parallel processing while preserving the capability to model long-range dependencies. Building on these advantages, researchers have adopted the Mamba architecture to develop medical image segmentation models [22][24], achieving both effective and efficient performance. However, challenges remain in applying these models to medical imaging tasks. Unlike text, which follows one-dimensional sequential order (e.g., forward or backward), medical image data is inherently three-dimensional and can be scanned in multiple directions, such as horizontal, vertical, or diagonal [25] [27]. Although scanning-based feature extraction can effectively emphasize"

ASM-UNet, a Mamba-based architecture with adaptive scan scores, enhances fine-grained segmentation by dynamically adjusting scanning orders to accommodate individual anatomical variations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Precise lesion resection depends on accurately identifying fine-grained anatomical structures. While many coarse-grained segmentation (CGS) methods have been successful in large-scale segmentation (e.g., organs), they fall short in clinical scenarios requiring fine-grained segmentation (FGS), which remains challenging due to frequent individual variations in small-scale anatomical structures. Although recent Mamba-based models have advanced medical image segmentation, they often rely on fixed manually-defined scanning orders, which limit their adaptability to individual variations in FGS. To address this, we propose ASM-UNet, a novel Mamba-based architecture for FGS. It introduces adaptive scan scores to dynamically guide the scanning order, generated by combining group-level commonalities and individual-level variations. Experiments on two public datasets (ACDC and Synapse) and a newly proposed challenging biliary tract FGS dataset, namely BTMS, demonstrate that ASM-UNet achieves superior performance in both CGS and FGS tasks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/YqunYang/ASM-UNet.
