Large language models (LLMs) struggle to follow instructions with complex constraints in format, length, etc. Following the conventional instruction-tuning practice, previous works conduct post-training on complex instruction-response pairs generated by feeding complex instructions to advanced LLMs. However, even advanced LLMs cannot follow complex instructions well, thus limiting the quality of generated data. In this work, we find that existing datasets inherently contain implicit complex constraints and propose a novel data generation technique, constraint back-translation. Specifically, we take the high-quality instruction-response pairs in existing datasets and only adopt advanced LLMs to add complex constraints already met by the responses to the instructions, which naturally reduces costs and data noise. In the experiments, we adopt Llama3-70B-Instruct to back-translate constraints and create a high-quality complex instruction-response dataset, named CRAB. We present that post-training on CRAB improves multiple backbone LLMs' complex instruction-following ability, evaluated on extensive instruction-following benchmarks. We further find that constraint back-translation also serves as a useful auxiliary training objective in post-training. Our code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to process long contexts, yet a notable gap remains in generating long, aligned outputs. This limitation stems from a training gap where pre-training lacks effective instructions for long-text generation, and post-training data primarily consists of short query-response pairs. Current approaches, such as instruction backtranslation and behavior imitation, face challenges including data quality, copyright issues, and constraints on proprietary model usage. In this paper, we introduce an innovative iterative training framework called Self-Lengthen that leverages only the intrinsic knowledge and skills of LLMs without the need for auxiliary data or proprietary models. The framework consists of two roles: the Generator and the Extender. The Generator produces the initial response, which is then split and expanded by the Extender. This process results in a new, longer response, which is used to train both the Generator and the Extender iteratively. Through this process, the models are progressively trained to handle increasingly longer responses. Experiments on benchmarks and human evaluations show that Self-Lengthen outperforms existing methods in long-text generation, when applied to top open-source LLMs such as Qwen2 and LLaMA3. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QwenLM/Self-Lengthen.
