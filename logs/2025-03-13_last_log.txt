Visualization of AE and LDM latent shift experiments. Top: we shift the input of an 8 upsampling VAE decoder by 1/8 pixel in each step. The intermediate output images from Stable Diffusion (SD) VAE appear increasingly blurry. Bottom: we shift the noisy latent of LDM by 1/8 pixel in each step. Without cross-frame attention, SD struggles to generate consistent results; even with it, we can observe bouncing effect, where textures initially stick but suddenly shift in subsequent steps. In contrast, our alias-free SD (AF-SD) produces shift-equivariant results in both experiments, maintaining consistency and clarity across steps. "

Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are known to have an unstable generation process, where even small perturbations or shifts in the input noise can lead to significantly different outputs. This hinders their applicability in applications requiring consistent results. In this work, we redesign LDMs to enhance consistency by making them shift-equivariant. While introducing anti-aliasing operations can partially improve shift-equivariance, significant aliasing and inconsistency persist due to the unique challenges in LDMs, including 1) aliasing amplification during VAE training and multiple U-Net inferences, and 2) self-attention modules that inherently lack shift-equivariance. To address these issues, we redesign the attention modules to be shift-equivariant and propose an equivariance loss that effectively suppresses the frequency bandwidth of the features in the continuous domain. The resulting alias-free LDM (AF-LDM) achieves strong shift-equivariance and is also robust to irregular warping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AF-LDM produces significantly more consistent results than vanilla LDM across various applications, including video editing and image-to-image translation.

Conditional motion generation has been extensively studied in computer vision, yet two critical challenges remain. First, while masked autoregressive methods have recently outperformed diffusion-based approaches, existing masking models lack a mechanism to prioritize dynamic frames and body parts based on given conditions. Second, existing methods for different conditioning modalities often fail to integrate multiple modalities effectively, limiting control and coherence in generated motion. To address these challenges, we propose Motion Anything, a multimodal motion generation framework that introduces an Attention-based Mask Modeling approach, enabling fine-grained spatial and temporal control over key frames and actions. Our model adaptively encodes multimodal conditions, including text and music, improving controllability. Additionally, we introduce Text-Music-Dance (TMD), a new motion dataset consisting of 2,153 pairs of text, music, and dance, making it twice the size of AIST++, thereby filling a critical gap in the community. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Motion Anything surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, achieving a 15% improvement in FID on HumanML3D and showing consistent performance gains on AIST++ and TMD.

"Conditional motion generation has been extensively studied in computer vision, yet two critical challenges remain. First, while masked autoregressive methods have recently outperformed diffusion-based approaches, existing masking models lack a mechanism to prioritize dynamic frames and body parts based on given conditions. Second, existing methods for different conditioning modalities often fail to integrate multiple modalities effectively, limiting control and coherence in generated motion. To address these challenges, we propose Motion Anything, a multimodal motion generation framework that introduces an Attention-based Mask Modeling approach, enabling fine-grained spatial and temporal control over key frames and actions. Our model adaptively encodes multimodal conditions, including text and music, improving controllability.
