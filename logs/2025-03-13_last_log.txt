The development of video diffusion models unveils a significant challenge: the substantial computational demands. To mitigate this challenge, we note that the reverse process of diffusion exhibits an inherent entropy-reducing nature. Given the inter-frame redundancy in video modality, maintaining full frame rates in high-entropy stages is unnecessary. Based on this insight, we propose TPDiff, a unified framework to enhance training and inference efficiency. By dividing diffusion into several stages, our framework progressively increases frame rate along the diffusion process with only the last stage operating on full frame rate, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. To train the multi-stage diffusion model, we introduce a dedicated training framework: stage-wise diffusion. By solving the partitioned probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODE) of diffusion under aligned data and noise, our training strategy is applicable to various diffusion forms and further enhances training efficiency. Comprehensive experimental evaluations validate the generality of our method, demonstrating 50% reduction in training cost and 1.5x improvement in inference efficiency.

We introduce Reangle-A-Video, a unified framework for generating synchronized multi-view videos from a single input video. Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on static view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video surpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video generation. We will publicly release our code and data. Project page: https://hyeonho99.github.io/reangle-a-video/

"We introduce Reangle-A-Video, a unified framework for generating synchronized multi-view videos from a single input video. Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on static view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video surpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video generation. We will publicly release our code and data. Project page: https://hyeonho99.github.io/reangle-a-video/"

Reinforcement learning with verifiable outcome rewards (RLVR) has effectively scaled up chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its efficacy in training vision-language model (VLM) agents for goal-directed action reasoning in visual environments is less established. This work investigates this problem through extensive experiments on complex card games, such as 24 points, and embodied tasks from ALFWorld. We find that when rewards are based solely on action outcomes, RL fails to incentivize CoT reasoning in VLMs, instead leading to a phenomenon we termed thought collapse, characterized by a rapid loss of diversity in the agent's thoughts, state-irrelevant and incomplete reasoning, and subsequent invalid actions, resulting in negative rewards. To counteract thought collapse, we highlight the necessity of process guidance and propose an automated corrector that evaluates and refines the agent's reasoning at each RL step. This simple and scalable GTR (Guided Thought Reinforcement) framework trains reasoning and action simultaneously without the need for dense, per-step human labeling. Our experiments demonstrate that GTR significantly enhances the performance and generalization of the LLaVA-7b model across various visual environments, achieving 3-5 times higher task success rates compared to SoTA models with notably smaller model sizes.

Human daily activities can be concisely narrated as sequences of routine events (e.g., turning off an alarm) in video streams, forming an event vocabulary. Motivated by this, we introduce VLog, a novel video understanding framework that define video narrations as vocabulary, going beyond the typical subword vocabularies in existing generative video-language models. Built on the lightweight language model GPT-2, VLog feature three key innovations: (i) A generative retrieval model, marrying language model's complex reasoning capabilities with contrastive retrieval's efficient similarity search. (ii) A hierarchical vocabulary derived from large-scale video narrations using our narration pair encoding algorithm, enabling efficient indexing of specific events (e.g., cutting a tomato) by identifying broader scenarios (e.g., kitchen) with expressive postfixes (e.g., by the left hand). (iii) A vocabulary update strategy leveraging generative models to extend the vocabulary for novel events encountered during inference. To validate our approach, we introduce VidCap-Eval, a development set requiring concise narrations with reasoning relationships (e.g., before and after). Experiments on EgoSchema, COIN, and HiREST further demonstrate the effectiveness of VLog, highlighting its ability to generate concise, contextually accurate, and efficient narrations, offering a novel perspective on video understanding.
