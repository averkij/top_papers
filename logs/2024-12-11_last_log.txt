Text:"4 2 0 2 9 ] . [ 1 4 7 6 6 0 . 2 1 4 2 : r IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE EMOv2: Pushing 5M Vision Model Frontier Jiangning Zhang, Teng Hu, Haoyang He, Zhucun Xue, Yabiao Wang, Chengjie Wang, Yong Liu, Xiangtai Li, Dacheng Tao AbstractThis work focuses on developing parameter-efficient and lightweight models for dense predictions while trading off parameters, FLOPs, and performance. Our goal is to set up the new frontier of the 5M magnitude lightweight model on various downstream tasks. Inverted Residual Block (IRB) serves as the infrastructure for lightweight CNNs, but no counterparts have been recognized by attention-based design. Our work rethinks the lightweight infrastructure of efficient IRB and practical components in Transformer from unified perspective, extending CNN-based IRB to attention-based models and abstracting one-residual Meta Mobile Block (MMBlock) for lightweight model design. Following neat but effective design criterion, we deduce modern Improved Inverted Residual Mobile Block (i2RMB) and improve hierarchical Efficient MOdel (EMOv2) with no elaborate complex structures. Considering the imperceptible latency for mobile users when downloading models under 4G/5G bandwidth and ensuring model performance, we investigate the performance upper limit of lightweight models with magnitude of 5M. Extensive experiments on various vision recognition, dense prediction, and image generation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our EMOv2 over state-of-the-art methods, e.g., EMOv2-1M/2M/5M achieve 72.3, 75.8, and 79.4 Top-1 that surpass equal-order CNN-/Attention-based models significantly. At the same time, EMOv2-5M equipped RetinaNet achieves 41.5 mAP for object detection tasks that surpasses the previous EMO-5M by +2.6. When employing the more robust training recipe, our EMOv2-5M eventually achieves 82.9 Top-1 accuracy, which elevates the performance of 5M magnitude models to new level.

However, recent studies demonstrate that information exchanged during FL is subject to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIA) and, consequently, variety of privacy-preserving methods have been integrated into FL to thwart such attacks, such as Secure Multi-party Computing (SMC), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Differential Privacy (DP). Despite their ability to protect data privacy, these approaches inherently involve substantial privacyutility trade-offs. By revisiting the key to privacy exposure in FL under GIA, which lies in the frequent sharing of model gradients that contain private data, we take new perspective by designing novel privacy preserve FL framework that effectively breaks the direct connection between the shared parameters and the local private data to defend against GIA. Specifically, we propose Hypernetwork Federated Learning (HyperFL) framework that utilizes hypernetworks to generate the parameters of the local model and only the hypernetwork parameters are uploaded to the server for aggregation. Theoretical analyses demonstrate the convergence rate of the proposed HyperFL, while extensive experimental results show the privacy-preserving capability and comparable performance o"

Story visualization, the task of creating visual narratives from textual descriptions, has seen progress with text-to-image generation models. However, these models often lack effective control over character appearances and interactions, particularly in multi-character scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a new task: customized manga generation and introduce DiffSensei, an innovative framework specifically designed for generating manga with dynamic multi-character control. DiffSensei integrates a diffusion-based image generator with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that acts as a text-compatible identity adapter. Our approach employs masked cross-attention to seamlessly incorporate character features, enabling precise layout control without direct pixel transfer. Additionally, the MLLM-based adapter adjusts character features to align with panel-specific text cues, allowing flexible adjustments in character expressions, poses, and actions. We also introduce MangaZero, a large-scale dataset tailored to this task, containing 43,264 manga pages and 427,147 annotated panels, supporting the visualization of varied character interactions and movements across sequential frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSensei outperforms existing models, marking a significant advancement in manga generation by enabling text-adaptable character customization.

"Story visualization, the task of creating visual narratives from textual descriptions, has seen progress with text-to-image generation models. However, these models often lack effective control over character appearances and interactions, particularly in multi-character scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a new task: customized manga generation and introduce DiffSensei, an innovative framework specifically designed for generating manga with dynamic multi-character control. DiffSensei integrates a diffusion-based image generator with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that acts as a text-compatible identity adapter. Our approach employs masked cross-attention to seamlessly incorporate character features, enabling precise layout control without direct pixel transfer. Additionally, the MLLM-based adapter adjusts character features to align with panel-specific text cues, allowing flexible adjustments in character expressions, poses, and actions. We also introduce MangaZero, a large-scale dataset tailored to this task, containing 43,264 manga pages and 427,147 annotated panels, supporting the visualization of varied character interactions and movements across sequential frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSensei outperforms existing models, marking a significant advancement in manga generation by enabling text-adaptable character customization.

This work focuses on developing parameter-efficient and lightweight models for dense predictions while trading off parameters, FLOPs, and performance. Our goal is to set up the new frontier of the 5M magnitude lightweight model on various downstream tasks. Inverted Residual Block (IRB) serves as the infrastructure for lightweight CNNs, but no counterparts have been recognized by attention-based design. Our work rethinks the lightweight infrastructure of efficient IRB and practical components in Transformer from a unified perspective, extending CNN-based IRB to attention-based models and abstracting a one-residual Meta Mobile Block (MMBlock) for lightweight model design. Following neat but effective design criterion, we deduce a modern Improved Inverted Residual Mobile Block (i2RMB) and improve a hierarchical Efficient MOdel (EMOv2) with no elaborate complex structures. Considering the imperceptible latency for mobile users when downloading models under 4G/5G bandwidth and ensuring model performance, we investigate the performance upper limit of lightweight models with a magnitude of 5M. Extensive experiments on various vision recognition, dense prediction, and image generation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our EMOv2 over state-of-the-art methods, e.g., EMOv2-1M/2M/5M achieve 72.3, 75.8, and 79.4 Top-1 that surpass equal-order CNN-/Attention-based models significantly. At the same time, EMOv2-5M equipped RetinaNet achieves 41.5 mAP for object detection tasks that surpasses the previous EMO-5M by +2.6. When employing the more robust training recipe, our EMOv2-5M eventually achieves 82.9 Top-1 accuracy, which elevates the performance of 5M magnitude models to a new level.

This study aims to achieve more precise and versatile object control in image-to-video (I2V) generation. Current methods typically represent the spatial movement of target objects with 2D trajectories, which often fail to capture user intention and frequently produce unnatural results. To enhance control, we present ObjCtrl-2.5D, a training-free object control approach that uses a 3D trajectory, extended from a 2D trajectory with depth information, as a control signal. By modeling object movement as camera movement, ObjCtrl-2.5D represents the 3D trajectory as a sequence of camera poses, enabling object motion control using an existing camera motion control I2V generation model (CMC-I2V) without training. To adapt the CMC-I2V model originally designed for global motion control to handle local object motion, we introduce a module to isolate the target object from the background, enabling independent local control. In addition, we devise an effective way to achieve more accurate object control by sharing low-frequency warped latent within the object's region across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ObjCtrl-2.5D significantly improves object control accuracy compared to training-free methods and offers more diverse control capabilities than training-based approaches using 2D trajectories, enabling complex effects like object rotation. Code and results are available at https://wzhouxiff.github.io/projects/ObjCtrl-2.5D/.

Recent advances in text-to-image generation have enabled the creation of high-quality images with diverse applications. However, accurately describing desired visual attributes can be challenging, especially for non-experts in art and photography. An intuitive solution involves adopting favorable attributes from the source images. Current methods attempt to distill identity and style from source images. However, "style" is a broad concept that includes texture, color, and artistic elements, but does not cover other important attributes such as lighting and dynamics. Additionally, a simplified "style" adaptation prevents combining multiple attributes from different sources into one generated image. In this work, we formulate a more effective approach to decompose the aesthetics of a picture into specific visual attributes, allowing users to apply characteristics such as lighting, texture, and dynamics from different images. To achieve this goal, we constructed the first fine-grained visual attributes dataset (FiVA) to the best of our knowledge. This FiVA dataset features a well-organized taxonomy for visual attributes and includes around 1 M high-quality generated images with visual attribute annotations. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a fine-grained visual attribute adaptation framework (FiVA-Adapter), which decouples and adapts visual attributes from one or more source images into a generated one. This approach enhances user-friendly customization, allowing users to selectively apply desired attributes to create images that meet their unique preferences and specific content requirements.

Federated Learning (FL) aims to protect data privacy by enabling clients to collectively train machine learning models without sharing their raw data. However, recent studies demonstrate that information exchanged during FL is subject to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIA) and, consequently, a variety of privacy-preserving methods have been integrated into FL to thwart such attacks, such as Secure Multi-party Computing (SMC), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Differential Privacy (DP). Despite their ability to protect data privacy, these approaches inherently involve substantial privacy-utility trade-offs. By revisiting the key to privacy exposure in FL under GIA, which lies in the frequent sharing of model gradients that contain private data, we take a new perspective by designing a novel privacy preserve FL framework that effectively ``breaks the direct connection'' between the shared parameters and the local private data to defend against GIA. Specifically, we propose a Hypernetwork Federated Learning (HyperFL) framework that utilizes hypernetworks to generate the parameters of the local model and only the hypernetwork parameters are uploaded to the server for aggregation. Theoretical analyses demonstrate the convergence rate of the proposed HyperFL, while extensive experimental results show the privacy-preserving capability and comparable performance of HyperFL.

The field of video generation has made remarkable advancements, yet there remains a pressing need for a clear, systematic recipe that can guide the development of robust and scalable models. In this work, we present a comprehensive study that systematically explores the interplay of model architectures, training recipes, and data curation strategies, culminating in a simple and scalable text-image-conditioned video generation method, named STIV. Our framework integrates image condition into a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) through frame replacement, while incorporating text conditioning via a joint image-text conditional classifier-free guidance. This design enables STIV to perform both text-to-video (T2V) and text-image-to-video (TI2V) tasks simultaneously. Additionally, STIV can be easily extended to various applications, such as video prediction, frame interpolation, multi-view generation, and long video generation, etc. With comprehensive ablation studies on T2I, T2V, and TI2V, STIV demonstrate strong performance, despite its simple design. An 8.7B model with 512 resolution achieves 83.1 on VBench T2V, surpassing both leading open and closed-source models like CogVideoX-5B, Pika, Kling, and Gen-3. The same-sized model also achieves a state-of-the-art result of 90.1 on VBench I2V task at 512 resolution. By providing a transparent and extensible recipe for building cutting-edge video generation models, we aim to empower future research and accelerate progress toward more versatile and reliable video generation solutions.

In this work, we present a comprehensive study that systematically explores the interplay of model architectures, training recipes, and data curation strategies, culminating in a simple and scalable text-image-conditioned video generation method, named STIV. Our framework integrates image condition into a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) through frame replacement, while incorporating text conditioning via a joint image-text conditional classifier-free guidance. This design enables STIV to perform both text-to-video (T2V) and text-image-to-video (TI2V) tasks simultaneously. Additionally, STIV can be easily extended to various applications, such as video prediction, frame interpolation, multi-view generation, and long video generation, etc. With comprehensive ablation studies on T2I, T2V, and TI2V, STIV demonstrate strong performance, despite its simple design. An 8.7B model with 512 resolution achieves 83.1 on VBench T2V, surpassing both leading open and closed-source models like CogVideoX-5B, Pika, Kling, and Gen-3. The same-sized model also achieves a state-of-the-art result of 90.1 on VBench I2V task at 512 resolution. By providing a transparent and extensible recipe for building cutting-edge video generation models, we aim to empower future research and accelerate progress toward more versatile and reliable video generation solutions."
