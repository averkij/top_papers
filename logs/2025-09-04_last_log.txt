[ 1 8 2 4 0 0 . 9 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Mixture of Global and Local Experts with Diffusion Transformer (Face-MoGLE) is unified and flexible framework for high-quality and controllable face generation. It supports text-to-face synthesis (left), mask-to-face synthesis (right), and multimodal face generation guided jointly by text and masks (middle). By harmonizing global context modeling with local detail refinement, Face-MoGLE produces highly photorealistic results with enhanced semantic consistency and visual fidelity. Abstract Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This paper introduces Face-MoGLE, novel framework featuring: (1) Semanticdecoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) mixture of global and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics for fine-grained controllability; (3) dynamic gating network producing time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial locations. Face-MoGLE provides powerful and flexible solution for high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its robust zero-shot "

MOSAIC framework enhances multi-subject image generation by ensuring precise semantic alignment and orthogonal feature disentanglement, achieving high fidelity even with multiple references.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference. To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably, while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex multi-subject synthesis applications.
