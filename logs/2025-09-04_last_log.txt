Text:"Robix: Unified Model for Robot Interaction, Reasoning and Planning Huang Fang, Mengxi Zhang, Heng Dong, Wei Li, Zixuan Wang, Qifeng Zhang, Xueyun Tian, Yucheng Hu, Hang LiEqual Contribution, Project LeadWe introduce Robix, unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within single vision-language architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in hierarchical robot system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.

[ 1 6 0 1 1 0 . 9 0 5 2 : rThe goal of generalist robots is to assist humans in diverse daily tasks within open, dynamic environments. Realizing this vision requires more than executing isolated commandsit demands the ability to engage in natural human interaction and reason through complex, long-horizon tasks. For example, when cleaning dining table, robot must not only recognize dishes and utensils, but also interpret nuanced instructions such as only clear the plates if people are finished eating, respond to corrections like leave that glass, and adapt to novel scenarios such as properly sorting stacked tableware. To meet these requirements, general-purpose robot system should adopt hierarchical architecture in which high-level cognitive layer handles complex multimodal reasoning, adaptive task planning, and natural human-robot interaction, while 1 Figure 1 demo of Robix, showcasing (1) complex instruction understanding with commonsense reasoning; (2) real-time interruption handling; (3) task-status monitoring and dynamic replanning; and (4) proactive dialogue to clarify ambiguous instructions or infer user intent. 2 low-level controller layer executes the atomic motor actions issued by the high-level layer. This division of responsibilities allows the robot to reason at macro level while acting at micro level, enabling human-like adaptability in real-world scenarios. Existing hierarchical approaches typically employ large language models (LLMs) or vision language models (VLMs) as the high-level cognitive layer for task planning, which decompose long-horizon tasks into executable subtasks for the low-level controller [1, 8, 17, 29, 53, 60, 84, 88]. However, these methods focus solely on task decomposition, overlooking human-robot interaction and embodied reasoning, which are essential for general-purpose robotic systems. Taking one step further, recent work [11] constructs modular pipelines that combine reasoning, planning, and interaction through hand-designed workflows. While workflow-based systems are easy to develop, their inflexibility and brittleness remain notable limitationsrooted primarily in rigid modularization and over-reliance on hand-engineered designs. In this work, we introduce Robix, unified high-level cognitive layer that seamlessly integrates reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within single model. Unlike modular frameworks, Robix adopts an end-to-end visionlanguage architecture natively designed for interactive task execution. At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and formulates interactive task execution as unified reasoning-action sequence, effectively functioning as the brain of generalist robot system. Figure 1 illustrates Robix in an interactive table-organization task, demonstrating flexible capabilities such as understanding complex instructions, handling real-time interruptions, monitoring task progress, and engaging in proactive dialogue to clarify ambiguous commands or infer user intent. Modeling such complex interactive task execution within single VLM is challenging. Although general VLMs have achieved strong performance in digital domains, extending them to physical robots is far more demanding: robots must continuously perceive and act in dynamic environments, interpret ambiguous instructions, adapt to real-time feedback, and make sequential decisions under strict physical and temporal constraints. Addressing this gap requires overcoming two major limitations of existing models: (1) limited embodied reasoningthe ability to ground objects and spatial concepts in the physical world and integrate these signals for adaptive planning and task-centric reasoning [64]; (2) lack of flexible multimodal interactionhindered both by its inherent complexity and by the scarcity of corresponding training data. To address these challenges, Robix is trained with three-stage strategy: Continued pretraining on general VLMs to enhance foundational embodied reasoning capabilities. We curate large-scale dataset covering various robot-relevant tasks, such as 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning, enabling the model to strengthen its grounded planning and reasoning abilities. Supervised finetuning to endow the model with complex interactive capabilities. We employ comprehensive data synthesis to incorporate chain-of-thought reasoning and model interactive task execution as unified reasoning-action sequence.

Text:"Technical reportKun Luo Ziyi Xia BAAI {ziyixia85,luokun695,chienqhj,zhengliu1026}@gmail.com Hongjin Qian Zheng LiuLarge language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple factual queries toward Deep Researchtasks that require decomposing questions into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA) fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, scalable framework for synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses dual-agent system to recursively build Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, curated test set, and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash), while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro). By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels, InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound reward design and trajectory-level exploration.

InfoSeeker-3B, compact LLM trained with the InfoSeek dataset, significantly outperforms Qwen3-32B and achieves performance on par with leading commercial LLMs (ordered in API prices), highlighting the strong potential of InfoSeek for advancing Deep Research tasks. Notably, the InfoSeek data synthesis framework is fully open-source, enabling convenient and scalable dataset construction. Equal contribution. Corresponding Author 1 Technical report Table 1: Comparison of the open-source status of classical QA datasets and recent data synthesis approaches for Deep Research. While prior datasets either lack structural depth or remain limited in scale, InfoSeek provides the first large-scale dataset dedicated to Deep Research scenarios, capable of generating hierarchical constraint satisfaction problems with controllable complexity, and supporting easy scalability for diverse research needs.

Beyond simple factual queries, emerging advances point to new frontier: Deep Researchwhere models must decompose complex tasks, generate sub-queries, and reason across diverse sources of information (OpenAI, 2025). Unlike conventional information seeking, which suffices for straightforward retrieval, Deep Research demands synthesizing heterogeneous evidence, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and often interacting with external tools (Wu et al., 2025c; Zhang et al., 2024). Such capabilities are essential for domains like scientific discovery and policy analysis, where problems are open-ended and knowledge landscapes continuously evolve. Consequently, Deep Research is increasingly viewed as cornerstone for the next generation of LLMs, shifting them from conversational assistants to autonomous knowledge engines (Li et al., 2025c). deep research question goes beyond simple factual lookup (OpenAI, 2025). It requires navigating multiple layers of knowledge integration, and is best understood in contrast with several simpler problem types. constraint satisfaction problem is solved by combining several independent conditions to narrow the candidate set. multi-hop problem demands sequence of dependent inferences and search (Yang et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2024; Qian et al., 2025). Deep research questions extend beyond both by involving hierarchy of interdependent constraints that intertwine both parallel conditions and sequential steps. The solution emerges only through progressively resolving this hierarchy of sub-questions. When the final answer is unique and verifiable, the reasoning process can be naturally represented as tree, with intermediate vertices denoting sub-questions and branches encoding their logical dependencies. In this work, rather than long-form open-ended tasks such as report writing, we focus on deep research questions that yield unique and verifiable answer. Some recent approaches propose carefully designed workflows for planning and tool use (Li et al., 2025b; Wu et al., 2025c; Soni et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025). While effective in narrow domains, these workflows lack the flexibility required for diverse Deep Research tasks (Li et al., 2025c). Another line of work enhances models reasoning and search capabilities through supervised finetuning (Sun et al., 2025b) or reinforcement learning (Jin et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025a; Zheng et al., 2025). Although such methods achieve gains on traditional and multi-hop QA benchmarks, their training still depends heavily on datasets like Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), which remain far simpler than real Deep Research scenarios. Other efforts (Wu et al., 2025b; Shi et al., 2025a) attempt to construct open-source QA datasets or trajectories, but these remain focused on multi-hop QA. More recent studies (Qian & Liu, 2025; Shi et al., 2025a; Wu et al., 2025a; Tao et al., 2025) explore harder question types involving web pages or Wikipedia, yet neither their datasets nor their workflows are publicly released.

"InfoSeek is a scalable framework for generating complex Deep Research tasks by synthesizing hierarchical constraint satisfaction problems, enabling models to outperform larger baselines on challenging benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA) fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set, and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash), while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro). By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels, InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and datasets in https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek{this repository}."
