In the teacher phase, the Cohere model with FP8 inference is used to translate the Orca dataset, which is then used to fine-tune Liquid 1.2B. In the bootstrapped translator phase, Liquid 1.2B translates datasets, producing group of arabic dataset. Liquid models and FANAR were then further fine-tuned on the combined translated datasets, yielding the final instruction-tuned models. ( is orca in arabic) enabled broad experimentation and downstream applications, accelerating community research into scaling, alignment, and efficient deployment. Multilingual modeling at scale. Alongside raw capability, major thrust in recent work targets multilinguality: building models and resources that operate across many languages. Dataset efforts range from broad-coverage sentence-aligned corpora such as Tatoeba [8] to large-scale conversational resources such as MASSIVE [9]. Engineering pipelines (e.g., warc2text extraction and parallel translation) have been used to derive multilingual corpora from web archives [10]. Beyond data, analyses probe whether models preserve knowledge and answer consistency across languages [11]. Model design has also embraced multilinguality from the ground up: BLOOM [12] supports 46 languages, while Baichuan-2 [13] and other families emphasize improved performance on nonEnglish tasks. Despite this breadth-first progress, per-language depth and cultural alignment remain uneven, especially for underrepresented languages. Arabic LLMs and the instruction-data bottleneck. Arabic poses distinct challenges due to diglossia, rich morphology, and wide dialectal variation. growing line of Arabic-centric work [14] spans monolingual pre-training (e.g. AraBERT [15]), foundation and chat models (e.g. JAIS [16], FANAR [17], PEACOCK [18], ACE-GPT [19], ALLAM [20]) and broader sovereign AI efforts such as Falcon [21]. Benchmarks, including Arabic-MMLU [22] , provide initial evaluation scaffolding, although coverage and difficulty remain limited relative to English. persistent bottleneck is the scarcity of high-quality Arabic instruction data, which constrains both instruction tuning and scaling. Previous works document the underrepresentation of non-English languages in pretraining corpora and their impact on downstream performance [2325]. In parallel, the community has explored the paradigms of AI trains AI, e.g., self-instruction and synthetic supervision, to overcome data scarcity [2629]. However, in Arabic, the volume and fidelity of the instruction data still lag behind. Language-centric vs. multilingual. We adopt the term language-centric to denote models whose primary optimization target is depth of capability in specific language (here, Arabic), rather than uniform breadth across many languages. language-centric approach can better capture linguistic nuance (e.g. morphology, orthography)[30], dialectal variation, and cultural/safety alignment, while still benefiting from cross-lingual transfer when appropriate. In practice, this requires (i) reliable translation pipelines to convert strong English supervision into Arabic without eroding instruction fidelity, and (ii) training strategies that scale across model sizes while preserving Arabic fluency and task competence. 2 LLMs as translators: opportunities for Arabic data bootstrapping. LLMs have recently emerged as strong machine translation engines [31], capable of long-document and stylistic translation, interactive workflows, and even domain-preserving scientific translation [32]. Creative strategies, such as searching for keywords / topics with multiple generations of candidates and selection [33], further improve quality. Broad evaluations in 120+ languages [34] suggest that carefully managed LLMs can serve as reliable translators. These developments make translation-first bootstrapping especially attractive for Arabic instruction tuning: If we can (1) compress capable translator for efficient, scalable inference and (2) preserve instruction semantics during translation, we can unlock large Arabic corpora suitable for high-quality tuning. In this report, we introduce HALA, family of Arabic languageOur approach and contributions. centric instruction and translation models built around an efficient translate-and-tune pipeline. Our contributions are as follows: Lightweight AREN translator. We compress strong multilingual translator to FP8 with dynamic scaling using LLM Compressor [35] and fine-tune LiquidAI/LFM2-1.2B to serve as fast, robust AREN engine. This translator is used to construct Arabic instruction data at scale while maintaining fidelity to the source instruction"

CARE, a retrieval-augmented reasoning framework, enhances LLMs by integrating in-context evidence, improving retrieval accuracy and answer generation performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with context fidelity, producing inconsistent answers when responding to questions based on provided information. Existing approaches either rely on expensive supervised fine-tuning to generate evidence post-answer or train models to perform web searches without necessarily improving utilization of the given context. We propose CARE, a novel native retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that teaches LLMs to explicitly integrate in-context evidence within their reasoning process with the model's own retrieval capabilities. Our method requires limited labeled evidence data while significantly enhancing both retrieval accuracy and answer generation performance through strategically retrieved in-context tokens in the reasoning chain. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world and counterfactual QA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms supervised fine-tuning, traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods, and external retrieval solutions. This work represents a fundamental advancement in making LLMs more accurate, reliable, and efficient for knowledge-intensive tasks.

"CARE, a retrieval-augmented reasoning framework, enhances LLMs by integrating in-context evidence, improving retrieval accuracy and answer generation performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with context fidelity, producing inconsistent answers when responding to questions based on provided information. Existing approaches either rely on expensive supervised fine-tuning to generate evidence post-answer or train models to perform web searches without necessarily improving utilization of the given context. We propose CARE, a novel native retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that teaches LLMs to explicitly integrate in-context evidence within their reasoning process with the model's own retrieval capabilities. Our method requires limited labeled evidence data while significantly enhancing both retrieval accuracy and answer generation performance through strategically retrieved in-context tokens in the reasoning chain. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world and counterfactual QA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms supervised fine-tuning, traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods, and external retrieval solutions. This work represents a fundamental advancement in making LLMs more accurate, reliable, and efficient for knowledge-intensive tasks."
