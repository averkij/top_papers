ICCV 2025 MARS2 workshop & challenge website: https://mars2workshop.github.io/iccv2025/ MARS2 GitHub organization: https://github.com/mars2workshopThis paper reviews the MARS2 2025 Challenge on Multimodal Reasoning. We aim to bring together different approaches in multimodal machine learning and LLMs via large benchmark. We hope it better allows researchers to follow the state-of-the-art in this very dynamic area. Meanwhile, growing number of testbeds have boosted the evolution of general-purpose large language models. Thus, this years MARS2 focuses on real-world and specialized scenarios to broaden the multimodal reasoning applications of MLLMs. Our organizing team released two tailored datasets Lens and AdsQA as test sets, which support general reasoning in 12 daily scenarios and domain-specific reasoning in advertisement videos, respectively. We evaluated 40+ baselines that include both generalist MLLMs and task-specific models, and opened up three competition tracks, i.e., Visual Grounding in Real-world Scenarios (VGRS), Visual Question Answering with Spatial Awareness (VQA-SA), and Visual Reasoning in Creative Advertisement Videos (VR-Ads). Finally, 76 teams from the renowned academic and industrial institutions have registered and 40+ valid submissions (out of 1200+) have been included in our ranking lists. Our datasets, code sets (40+ baselines and 15+ participants methods), and rankings are publicly available on the MARS2 workshop website and our GitHub organization page https://github.com/ mars2workshop/, where our updates and announcements of upcoming events will be continuously provided. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) [91, 93] represent major advance and may mark crucial step towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). LLMs exhibit various characteristics that push the envelope of traditional deep learning, including generalization and emergent abilities [9], chainof-thought (CoT) [122], instruction understanding and following [166], tool calling [102], etc. Specifically, LLMs equipped with long chain reasoning capabilities such as OpenAI o1 [49] and DeepSeek-R1 [41] have opened up new avenue of large reasoning models. Furthermore, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have expanded the application boundaries of language models and further advanced multimodal machine learning [132, 133]. Given the remarkable progress of LLMs and multimodal machine learning, natural question for researchers is what to focus on next. Simply deploying LLMs on tasks that conventional deep learning already solves well is unsurprising and adds little novelty. Instead, we should pursue more challenging [10] and specialized [106] tasks that require complex multimodal reasoning and slower, System 2 thinking [32], borrowing from Kahnemans dual-process view of mind [56]). Thus, we have organized the MARS2 Workshop and Challenge Multimodal Reasoning and Slow Thinking in the Large Model Era: Towards System 2 and Beyond. The goal is to bring together perspectives from multiple disciplines and to help researchers follow the stateof-the-art in both multimodal machine learning and multimodal large language models. Motivation and objectives. Domain-specific problems highlight the challenge of equipping general-purpose models with specialized expertise. Accordingly, this years MARS2 focuses on real-world and specialized scenarios to broaden the multimodal reasoning applications of MLLMs. In particular, we explore the following challenges: Synergistic effects among reasoning tasks. Existing reasoning benchmarks fail to guarantee that different task samples come from the same data distribution, thus falling short of evaluating the synergistic effects among the different reasoning tasks [142]. Non-stepwise complex reasoning. It has been observed [39, 152] that LLMs already work well for stepwise problems such as math and programming that are based on explicit theorems and programming syntax, compatible with the chain-style reasoning approach if A, then B. To further advance LLM reasoning, we should study complex reasoning that goes beyond step-wise approaches. Therefore, we released two tailored datasets Lens [142] and AdsQA [84] as our competition test sets to draw the attention of the community to these two issues. For details, we refer to Section 2.1. Overview and features. This challenge was organized in conjunction with the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Workshop Multimodal Reasoning and Slow Thinking in the Large Model Era: Towards System 2 and Beyond. Our committee organized team consisting of 80+ data contributors and baseline model testers. Two large-scale and tailored datasets Lens [142] and AdsQA [84] were released as test sets, which support general reasoning in 12 daily scenarios and domain-specific reasoning in advertisement videos, respectively. We evaluated over 40 baselines that include both generalist MLLMs and task-specific models, covering open-source and commercial models. This year, we provided three competition tracks: Track #1 Visual Grounding in Real-world Scenarios (VG-RS), Track #2 Visual Question Answering with Spatial Awareness (VQASA), and Track #3 Visual Reasoning in Creative Advertisement Videos (VR-Ads). The challenge was divided into two stages and lasted for more than two months. 76 teams from renowned academic and industrial institutions (e.g., ByteDance, Meituan, NVIDIA, and Samsung) have registered and submitted 1200+ entries in total, of which 40+ valid submissions have been included in our final ranking lists. Our datasets, codes (40+ baselines and 15+ participants methods), and rankings are publicly available at the MARS2 workshop website and our GitHub repositories. Thanks to the significant efforts of all contributors and participants, the MARS2 workshop met our expect"

The MARS2 2025 Challenge focuses on multimodal reasoning with large language models through real-world and specialized scenarios, evaluating 40+ models across three competition tracks using tailored datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper reviews the MARS2 2025 Challenge on Multimodal Reasoning. We aim to bring together different approaches in multimodal machine learning and LLMs via a large benchmark. We hope it better allows researchers to follow the state-of-the-art in this very dynamic area. Meanwhile, a growing number of testbeds have boosted the evolution of general-purpose large language models. Thus, this year's MARS2 focuses on real-world and specialized scenarios to broaden the multimodal reasoning applications of MLLMs. Our organizing team released two tailored datasets Lens and AdsQA as test sets, which support general reasoning in 12 daily scenarios and domain-specific reasoning in advertisement videos, respectively. We evaluated 40+ baselines that include both generalist MLLMs and task-specific models, and opened up three competition tracks, i.e., Visual Grounding in Real-world Scenarios (VG-RS), Visual Question Answering with Spatial Awareness (VQA-SA), and Visual Reasoning in Creative Advertisement Videos (VR-Ads). Finally, 76 teams from the renowned academic and industrial institutions have registered and 40+ valid submissions (out of 1200+) have been included in our ranking lists. Our datasets, code sets (40+ baselines and 15+ participants' methods), and rankings are publicly available on the MARS2 workshop website and our GitHub organization page https://github.com/mars2workshop/, where our updates and announcements of upcoming events will be continuously provided.

Wan-Animate is a unified framework for character animation and replacement, using spatially-aligned skeleton signals and implicit facial features to generate high-fidelity character videos with seamless environmental integration.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Wan-Animate, a unified framework for character animation and replacement. Given a character image and a reference video, Wan-Animate can animate the character by precisely replicating the expressions and movements of the character in the video to generate high-fidelity character videos. Alternatively, it can integrate the animated character into the reference video to replace the original character, replicating the scene's lighting and color tone to achieve seamless environmental integration. Wan-Animate is built upon the Wan model. To adapt it for character animation tasks, we employ a modified input paradigm to differentiate between reference conditions and regions for generation. This design unifies multiple tasks into a common symbolic representation. We use spatially-aligned skeleton signals to replicate body motion and implicit facial features extracted from source images to reenact expressions, enabling the generation of character videos with high controllability and expressiveness. Furthermore, to enhance environmental integration during character replacement, we develop an auxiliary Relighting LoRA. This module preserves the character's appearance consistency while applying the appropriate environmental lighting and color tone. Experimental results demonstrate that Wan-Animate achieves state-of-the-art performance. We are committed to open-sourcing the model weights and its source code.

SAIL-VL2, a vision-language foundation model, achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks through data curation, progressive training, and sparse MoE architecture.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce SAIL-VL2, an open-suite vision-language foundation model (LVM) for comprehensive multimodal understanding and reasoning. As the successor to SAIL-VL, SAIL-VL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance at the 2B and 8B parameter scales across diverse image and video benchmarks, demonstrating strong capabilities from fine-grained perception to complex reasoning. Three core innovations drive its effectiveness. First, a large-scale data curation pipeline with scoring and filtering strategies enhances both quality and distribution across captioning, OCR, QA, and video data, improving training efficiency. Second, a progressive training framework begins with a powerful pre-trained vision encoder (SAIL-ViT), advances through multimodal pre-training, and culminates in a thinking-fusion SFT-RL hybrid paradigm that systematically strengthens model capabilities. Third, architectural advances extend beyond dense LLMs to efficient sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) designs. With these contributions, SAIL-VL2 demonstrates competitive performance across 106 datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as MMMU and MathVista. Furthermore, on the OpenCompass leaderboard, SAIL-VL2-2B ranks first among officially released open-source models under the 4B parameter scale, while serving as an efficient and extensible foundation for the open-source multimodal community.

"SAIL-VL2, a vision-language foundation model, achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks through data curation, progressive training, and sparse MoE architecture.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce SAIL-VL2, an open-suite vision-language foundation model (LVM) for comprehensive multimodal understanding and reasoning. As the successor to SAIL-VL, SAIL-VL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance at the 2B and 8B parameter scales across diverse image and video benchmarks, demonstrating strong capabilities from fine-grained perception to complex reasoning. Three core innovations drive its effectiveness. First, a large-scale data curation pipeline with scoring and filtering strategies enhances both quality and distribution across captioning, OCR, QA, and video data, improving training efficiency. Second, a progressive training framework begins with a powerful pre-trained vision encoder (SAIL-ViT), advances through multimodal pre-training, and culminates in a thinking-fusion SFT-RL hybrid paradigm that systematically strengthens model capabilities. Third, architectural advances extend beyond dense LLMs to efficient sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) designs. With these contributions, SAIL-VL2 demonstrates competitive performance across 106 datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as MMMU and MathVista. Furthermore, on the OpenCompass leaderboard, SAIL-VL2-2B ranks first among officially released open-source models under the 4B parameter scale, while serving as an efficient and extensible foundation for the open-source multimodal community."

THOR, a tool-integrated hierarchical optimization framework using RL, enhances mathematical reasoning and code generation by constructing high-quality datasets, optimizing reasoning paths, and correcting errors during inference.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in mathematical reasoning, but still continue to struggle with high-precision tasks like numerical computation and formal symbolic manipulation. Integrating external tools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing tool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and enhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR (Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen, a multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality datasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and generalizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained hierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes for both trajectory-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This is motivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call is a strong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR incorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback to dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach demonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing effectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models. It further achieves state-of-the-art performance for models of a similar scale on multiple mathematical benchmarks, while also delivering consistent improvements on code benchmarks. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/JingMog/THOR.
