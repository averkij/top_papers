Text:"Synthesizing Behaviorally-Grounded Reasoning Chains: Data-Generation Framework for Personal Finance LLMs5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 0 8 1 4 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r aPersonalized financial advice requires consideration of user goals, constraints, risk tolerance, and jurisdiction. Prior LLM work has focused on support systems for investors and financial planners. Simultaneously, numerous recent studies examine broader personal finance tasks, including budgeting, debt management, retirement, and estate planning, through agentic pipelines that incur high maintenance costs, yielding less than 25% of their expected financial returns. In this study, we introduce novel and reproducible framework that integrates relevant financial context with behavioral finance studies to construct supervision data for end-toend advisors. Using this framework, we create 19k sample reasoning dataset and conduct comprehensive fine-tuning of the Qwen-3-8B model on the dataset. Through held-out test split and blind LLM-jury study, we demonstrate that through careful data curation and behavioral integration, our 8B model achieves performance comparable to significantly larger baselines (14-32B parameters) across factual accuracy, fluency, and personalization metrics while incurring 80% lower costs than the larger counterparts. Keywords: Financial Datasets; Personal Finance; Reasoning Models; Large Language ModelsLegal counseling, healthcare, and finance are among the numerous high-stakes domains in which personalized advice is essential. However, the development of this personalized advice is fraught with obstacles, requiring substantial investments and years of human expertise. Recent research efforts have thoroughly investigated automated decision support systems in various areas, emphasizing their cost-effectiveness. In the financial sector, variety of support systems have been investigated, with particular emphasis on asset recommendations and investment predictions. (Sanz-Cruzado 1 et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2025; Takayanagi et al., 2023) Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown effective performance in acting as decision support systems for investors (Gupta, 2023) and financial planners (Huang et al., 2024). The core advantage of natural language generation presents these automated support systems with unique advantage that was never available in previous applications. This advantage has repeatedly shown its power in linguistic tasks such as streamlining complex financial narratives from extensive documents, corporate discourses, news sources, and social media.(Gueta et al., 2025; Lee and Lay-Ki, 2024) The utility of these models is also being explored in Time series (Liu and Jia, 2025) and Financial reasoning applications (Liu et al., 2025). Notwithstanding this capability, recent research indicates that no model excels across all financial task categories, which include text summarization, sentiment analysis, causal analysis, forecasting, It and text classification (Matlin et al., 2025). has been demonstrated that attaining robust performance frequently necessitates the utilization of large, expensive models, thereby constraining the practicality of these solutions. Due to these inherent limitations and the complexity of financial advisory, many studies focusing on broader financial decision systems have preferred an agentic approach over training financial domain-specific language models. (Okpala et al., 2025; Joshi, 2025; Takayanagi et al., 2025a) Although the initial agentic frameworks focused on answering simple inquiries,(Lakkaraju et al., 2023) recent studies have accelerated the development of these systems to provide practical and actionable advice to the end user (Takayanagi et al., 2025b; Okpala et al., 2025). These agents can now dynamically interact with users and can assist in various tasks such as recommendation, question answering, search, and customer profiling. (Li et al., 2024; Takayanagi et al., 2025a; Han et al., 2024) Although agentic systems demonstrate potential in providing tailored financial advice, their efficacy is hindered by considerable constraints, including the integration with legacy systems, compliance with data security regulations, and high inference (Cemri et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025). costs. In support of these concerns, recent study by (Meimandi et al., 2025) illustrates that confluence of technical and cost-related factors hinders these applications from realizing even 25% of their anticipated returns. This research also establishes an important differentiation: success in benchmarks does not necessarily equate to success in deployment. In practical terms, these proactive financial advisors frequently encounter swift deterioration in performance within matter of months following their implementation, attributable to the inherent volatility of real-world conditions. Concurrently, studies show that the extent of personalization is often limited by the volume of context and information that can be supplied to an agent, impacting the overall performance. (Zhou et al., 2025; Winder et al., 2024) One of the direct ways to address these limitations is to tune model with domain-specific context that integrates financial, behavioral, and psychological information. This work aims to close this gap by providing reproducible framework to generate financial advice through well-structured chain-of-thought. In particular, the framework constructs supervision data to train models to (a) provide personalized guidance for users financial dilemmas, (b) reliably apply core financial knowledge, and (c) recognize and mitigate user-side behavioral biases by integrating behavioral and historical evidence. To address these limitations, we propose novel, data-centric framework for synthesising behaviorally-grounded reasoning chains. Rather than relying on complex agentic architectures, our approach directly bakes financial, behavioural, and psychological knowledge into the training data itself. Crucially, we treat the inference of the users psychological state not as an afterthought, but as standalone, foundational phase in the reasoning chain. This design choice is directly motivated by recent findings that users trust and engagement are heavily influenced by the persona of the advisor (Takayanagi et al., 2025a), not just the raw accuracy of its advice. By isolating and explicitly modelling this psychological dimension, our framework ensures that personalisation and empathetic fr"
