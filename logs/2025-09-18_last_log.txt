Text:"5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 8 0 0 4 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r HALA Technical Report: Building Arabic-Centric Instruction & Translation Models at Scale Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud Mohammad Zbeeb In Arabic, (Hala) conveys sweetness and beauty - qualities long associated with the language itself. In this spirit, we call our models Hala. We present HALA, family of Arabic-centric instruction and translation models built with our translate-and-tune pipeline. We first compress strong AREN teacher to FP8 (yielding 2 higher throughput with no quality loss) and use it to create high-fidelity bilingual supervision. lightweight language model LFM2-1.2B is then fine-tuned on this data and used to translate high-quality English instruction sets into Arabic, producing million-scale corpus tailored to instruction following. We train HALA models at 350M, 700M, 1.2B, and 9B parameters, and apply slerp merging to balance Arabic specialization with base-model strengths. On Arabic-centric benchmarks, HALA achieves state-of-the-art results within both the nano (2B) and small (79B) categories, outperforming their bases. We release models, data, evaluation, and recipes to accelerate research in Arabic NLP. Models & Data: hf.co/collections/Hala Code: github.com/Hala Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced the state-of-the-art across general-purpose NLP, demonstrating strong capabilities in few-shot learning, instruction following, and multistep reasoning. Early milestones such as GPT-3 [1] catalyzed this progress, while more recent families (e.g., Gemini [2], Claude 3) continue to expand the frontier of capability and reliability. Open-weight counterparts, including DeepSeek [3], LLaMA 3 [4], Qwen [5], Gemma [6], and Kimi K2 [7], have Equal Contribution.

Text:"MedResearcher-R1: Expert-Level Medical Deep Researcher via Knowledge-Informed Trajectory Synthesis Framework Ailing Yu1 Yuan Wang1 Xinhao Liao1 Lan Yao2* Jingnan Liu1 Zhe Chen1 Jiajun Yin Zhiling Ye1 Ji Li1 Yun Yue1 Junwei Liu1 Jinjie Gu1 Hansong Xiao1 Hualei Zhou1 Chunxiao Guo1 Peng Wei1 1Ant Group 2Harbin Institute of Technology (cid:135) Code and Dataset: AQ-MedAI/MedResearcher-R1 Abstract Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts. We present medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions. Through two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general dee"

Text:"Quantum Variational Activation Functions Empower Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Jiun-Cheng Jiang Morris Yu-Chao Huang Tianlong Chen Hsi-Sheng Goan jcjiang@phys.ntu.edu.tw, {morris, tianlong}@cs.unc.edu, goan@phys.ntu.edu.tw September 18, 2025 Abstract Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are central to quantum machine learning, while recent progress in Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) highlights the power of learnable activation functions. We unify these directions by introducing quantum variational activation functions (QVAFs), realized through single-qubit data re-uploading circuits called DatA Re-Uploading ActivatioNs (DARUANs). We show that DARUAN with trainable weights in data pre-processing possesses an exponentially growing frequency spectrum with data repetitions, enabling an exponential reduction in parameter size compared with Fourier-based activations without loss of expressivity. Embedding DARUAN into KANs yields quantum-inspired KANs (QKANs), which retain the interpretability of KANs while improving their parameter efficiency, expressivity, and generalization. We further introduce two novel techniques to enhance scalability, feasibility and computational efficiency, such as layer extension and hybrid QKANs (HQKANs) as drop-in replacements of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for feed-forward networks in large-scale models. We provide theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on function regression, image classification, and autoregressive generative language modeling, demonstrating the efficiency and scalability of QKANs. DARUANs and QKANs offer promising direction for advancing quantum machine learning on both noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware and classical quantum simulators.

Text:"Hybrid Quantum-Classical Model for Image Classification Muhammad Adnan Shahzad1 1Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada This study presents systematic comparison between hybrid quantum-classical neural networks and purely classical models across three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100, and STL10) to evaluate their performance, efficiency, and robustness. The hybrid models integrate parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep learning architectures, while the classical counterparts use conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments were conducted over 50 training epochs for each dataset, with evaluations on validation accuracy, test accuracy, training time, computational resource usage, and adversarial robustness (tested with ϵ = 0.1 perturbations). Key findings demonstrate that hybrid models consistently outperform classical models in final accuracy, achieving 99.38% (MNIST), 41.69% (CIFAR100), and 74.05% (STL10) validation accuracy, compared to classical benchmarks of 98.21%, 32.25%, and 63.76%, respectively. Notably, the hybrid advantage scales with dataset complexity, showing the most significant gains on CIFAR100 (+9.44%) and STL10 (+10.29%). Hybrid models also train 512 faster (e.g., 21.23s vs. 108.44s per epoch on MNIST) and use 632% fewer parameters while maintaining superior generalization to unseen test data. Adversarial robustness tests reveal that hybrid models are significantly more resilient on simpler datasets (e.g., 45.27% robust accuracy on MNIST vs. 10.80% for classical) but show comparable fragility on complex datasets like CIFAR100 (1% robustness for both). Resource efficiency analyses indicate that hybrid models consume less memory (45GB vs. 56GB for classical) and lower CPU utilization (9.5% vs. 23.2% on average). These results suggest that hybrid quantum-classical architectures offer compelling advantages in accuracy, training efficiency, and parameter scalability"

Quantum variational activation functions (QVAFs) and quantum-inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (QKANs) enhance parameter efficiency and expressivity in quantum machine learning, offering scalability and improved performance in various tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are central to quantum machine learning, while recent progress in Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) highlights the power of learnable activation functions. We unify these directions by introducing quantum variational activation functions (QVAFs), realized through single-qubit data re-uploading circuits called DatA Re-Uploading ActivatioNs (DARUANs). We show that DARUAN with trainable weights in data pre-processing possesses an exponentially growing frequency spectrum with data repetitions, enabling an exponential reduction in parameter size compared with Fourier-based activations without loss of expressivity. Embedding DARUAN into KANs yields quantum-inspired KANs (QKANs), which retain the interpretability of KANs while improving their parameter efficiency, expressivity, and generalization. We further introduce two novel techniques to enhance scalability, feasibility and computational efficiency, such as layer extension and hybrid QKANs (HQKANs) as drop-in replacements of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for feed-forward networks in large-scale models. We provide theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on function regression, image classification, and autoregressive generative language modeling, demonstrating the efficiency and scalability of QKANs. DARUANs and QKANs offer a promising direction for advancing quantum machine learning on both noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware and classical quantum simulators.

Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks outperform classical models in accuracy, training efficiency, and parameter scalability across various datasets, especially for complex vision tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 This study presents a systematic comparison between hybrid quantum-classical neural networks and purely classical models across three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100, and STL10) to evaluate their performance, efficiency, and robustness. The hybrid models integrate parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep learning architectures, while the classical counterparts use conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments were conducted over 50 training epochs for each dataset, with evaluations on validation accuracy, test accuracy, training time, computational resource usage, and adversarial robustness (tested with epsilon=0.1 perturbations).Key findings demonstrate that hybrid models consistently outperform classical models in final accuracy, achieving {99.38\% (MNIST), 41.69\% (CIFAR100), and 74.05\% (STL10) validation accuracy, compared to classical benchmarks of 98.21\%, 32.25\%, and 63.76\%, respectively. Notably, the hybrid advantage scales with dataset complexity, showing the most significant gains on CIFAR100 (+9.44\%) and STL10 (+10.29\%). Hybrid models also train 5--12times faster (e.g., 21.23s vs. 108.44s per epoch on MNIST) and use 6--32\% fewer parameters} while maintaining superior generalization to unseen test data.Adversarial robustness tests reveal that hybrid models are significantly more resilient on simpler datasets (e.g., 45.27\% robust accuracy on MNIST vs. 10.80\% for classical) but show comparable fragility on complex datasets like CIFAR100 (sim1\% robustness for both). Resource efficiency analyses indicate that hybrid models consume less memory (4--5GB vs. 5--6GB for classical) and lower CPU utilization (9.5\% vs. 23.2\% on average).These results suggest that hybrid quantum-classical architectures offer compelling advantages in accuracy, training efficiency, and parameter scalability, particularly for complex vision tasks.

"Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks outperform classical models in accuracy, training efficiency, and parameter scalability across various datasets, especially for complex vision tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 This study presents a systematic comparison between hybrid quantum-classical neural networks and purely classical models across three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100, and STL10) to evaluate their performance, efficiency, and robustness. The hybrid models integrate parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep learning architectures, while the classical counterparts use conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments were conducted over 50 training epochs for each dataset, with evaluations on validation accuracy, test accuracy, training time, computational resource usage, and adversarial robustness (tested with epsilon=0.1 perturbations).Key findings demonstrate that hybrid models consistently outperform classical models in final accuracy, achieving {99.38\% (MNIST), 41.69\% (CIFAR100), and 74.05\% (STL10) validation accuracy, compared to classical benchmarks of 98.21\%, 32.25\%, and 63.76\%, respectively. Notably, the hybrid advantage scales with dataset complexity, showing the most significant gains on CIFAR100 (+9.44\%) and STL10 (+10.29\%). Hybrid models also train 5--12times faster (e.g., 21.23s vs. 108.44s per epoch on MNIST) and use 6--32\% fewer parameters} while maintaining superior generalization to unseen test data.Adversarial robustness tests reveal that hybrid models are significantly more resilient on simpler datasets (e.g., 45.27\% robust accuracy on MNIST vs. 10.80\% for classical) but show comparable fragility on complex datasets like CIFAR100 (sim1\% robustness for both).
