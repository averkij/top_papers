With the growing demand for high-fidelity 3D models from 2D images, existing methods still face significant challenges in accurately reproducing fine-grained geometric details due to limitations in domain gaps and inherent ambiguities in RGB images. To address these issues, we propose Hi3DGen, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity 3D geometry from images via normal bridging. Hi3DGen consists of three key components: (1) an image-to-normal estimator that decouples the low-high frequency image pattern with noise injection and dual-stream training to achieve generalizable, stable, and sharp estimation; (2) a normal-to-geometry learning approach that uses normal-regularized latent diffusion learning to enhance 3D geometry generation fidelity; and (3) a 3D data synthesis pipeline that constructs a high-quality dataset to support training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework in generating rich geometric details, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of fidelity. Our work provides a new direction for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation from images by leveraging normal maps as an intermediate representation.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning large language models with human preferences. While recent research has focused on algorithmic improvements, the importance of prompt-data construction has been overlooked. This paper addresses this gap by exploring data-driven bottlenecks in RLHF performance scaling, particularly reward hacking and decreasing response diversity. We introduce a hybrid reward system combining reasoning task verifiers (RTV) and a generative reward model (GenRM) to mitigate reward hacking. We also propose a novel prompt-selection method, Pre-PPO, to maintain response diversity and enhance learning effectiveness. Additionally, we find that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks early in RLHF training significantly improves performance. Experiments across two model sizes validate our methods' effectiveness and scalability. Results show that RTV is most resistant to reward hacking, followed by GenRM with ground truth, and then GenRM with SFT Best-of-N responses. Our strategies enable rapid capture of subtle task-specific distinctions, leading to substantial improvements in overall RLHF performance. This work highlights the importance of careful data construction and provides practical methods to overcome performance barriers in RLHF.

"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning large language models with human preferences. While recent research has focused on algorithmic improvements, the importance of prompt-data construction has been overlooked. This paper addresses this gap by exploring data-driven bottlenecks in RLHF performance scaling, particularly reward hacking and decreasing response diversity. We introduce a hybrid reward system combining reasoning task verifiers (RTV) and a generative reward model (GenRM) to mitigate reward hacking. We also propose a novel prompt-selection method, Pre-PPO, to maintain response diversity and enhance learning effectiveness. Additionally, we find that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks early in RLHF training significantly improves performance. Experiments across two model sizes validate our methods' effectiveness and scalability. Results show that RTV is most resistant to reward hacking, followed by GenRM with ground truth, and then GenRM with SFT Best-of-N responses. Our strategies enable rapid capture of subtle task-specific distinctions, leading to substantial improvements in overall RLHF performance. This work highlights the importance of careful data construction and provides practical methods to overcome performance barriers in RLHF."

Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for achieving a high-level understanding of visual scenes and has numerous downstream applications. Humans can effortlessly segment moving objects in videos. Previous work has largely relied on optical flow to provide motion cues; however, this approach often results in imperfect predictions due to challenges such as partial motion, complex deformations, motion blur and background distractions. We propose a novel approach for moving object segmentation that combines long-range trajectory motion cues with DINO-based semantic features and leverages SAM2 for pixel-level mask densification through an iterative prompting strategy. Our model employs Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Attention and Motion-Semantic Decoupled Embedding to prioritize motion while integrating semantic support. Extensive testing on diverse datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, excelling in challenging scenarios and fine-grained segmentation of multiple objects.

Motivated in part by their relevance for low-precision training and quantization, massive activations in large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a topic of interest. However, existing analyses are limited in scope, and generalizability across architectures is unclear. This paper helps address some of these gaps by conducting an analysis of massive activations across a broad range of LLMs, including both GLU-based and non-GLU-based architectures. Our findings challenge several prior assumptions, most importantly: (1) not all massive activations are detrimental, i.e. suppressing them does not lead to an explosion of perplexity or a collapse in downstream task performance; (2) proposed mitigation strategies such as Attention KV bias are model-specific and ineffective in certain cases. We consequently investigate novel hybrid mitigation strategies; in particular pairing Target Variance Rescaling (TVR) with Attention KV bias or Dynamic Tanh (DyT) successfully balances the mitigation of massive activations with preserved downstream model performance in the scenarios we investigated.

"Motivated in part by their relevance for low-precision training and quantization, massive activations in large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a topic of interest. However, existing analyses are limited in scope, and generalizability across architectures is unclear. This paper helps address some of these gaps by conducting an analysis of massive activations across a broad range of LLMs, including both GLU-based and non-GLU-based architectures. Our findings challenge several prior assumptions, most importantly: (1) not all massive activations are detrimental, i.e. suppressing them does not lead to an explosion of perplexity or a collapse in downstream task performance; (2) proposed mitigation strategies such as Attention KV bias are model-specific and ineffective in certain cases. We consequently investigate novel hybrid mitigation strategies; in particular pairing Target Variance Rescaling (TVR) with Attention KV bias or Dynamic Tanh (DyT) successfully balances the mitigation of massive activations with preserved downstream model performance in the scenarios we investigated. Our code is available at: https://github.com/bluorion-com/refine_massive_activations."

Creating high-fidelity 3D meshes with arbitrary topology, including open surfaces and complex interiors, remains a significant challenge. Existing implicit field methods often require costly and detail-degrading watertight conversion, while other approaches struggle with high resolutions. This paper introduces SparseFlex, a novel sparse-structured isosurface representation that enables differentiable mesh reconstruction at resolutions up to 1024^3 directly from rendering losses. SparseFlex combines the accuracy of Flexicubes with a sparse voxel structure, focusing computation on surface-adjacent regions and efficiently handling open surfaces. Crucially, we introduce a frustum-aware sectional voxel training strategy that activates only relevant voxels during rendering, dramatically reducing memory consumption and enabling high-resolution training. This also allows, for the first time, the reconstruction of mesh interiors using only rendering supervision. Building upon this, we demonstrate a complete shape modeling pipeline by training a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a rectified flow transformer for high-quality 3D shape generation. Our experiments show state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy, with a ~82% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a ~88% increase in F-score compared to previous methods, and demonstrate the generation of high-resolution, detailed 3D shapes with arbitrary topology. By enabling high-resolution, differentiable mesh reconstruction and generation with rendering losses, SparseFlex significantly advances the state-of-the-art in 3D shape representation and modeling.
