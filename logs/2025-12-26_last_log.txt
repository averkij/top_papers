Spatia, a spatial memory-aware video generation framework, maintains long-term spatial and temporal consistency by preserving and updating a 3D scene point cloud, enabling realistic video generation and interactive editing.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing video generation models struggle to maintain long-term spatial and temporal consistency due to the dense, high-dimensional nature of video signals. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatia, a spatial memory-aware video generation framework that explicitly preserves a 3D scene point cloud as persistent spatial memory. Spatia iteratively generates video clips conditioned on this spatial memory and continuously updates it through visual SLAM. This dynamic-static disentanglement design enhances spatial consistency throughout the generation process while preserving the model's ability to produce realistic dynamic entities. Furthermore, Spatia enables applications such as explicit camera control and 3D-aware interactive editing, providing a geometrically grounded framework for scalable, memory-driven video generation.

The paper focuses on improving video generation through a spatial memory-aware framework that maintains consistency during generation. While it involves technical advancement in the generation process, the primary contribution is an optimization of the video generation method through better spatial memory management and consistency preservation. The paper does not clearly fit into other categories like diffusion models (no mention of diffusion-based approaches), long context (not about language models or text context), or other listed topics.
