  "desc": "Статья исследует механизмы улучшения рассуждений в крупных языковых моделях (LLM) с помощью стратегий вывода. Авторы сравнивают модель o1 от OpenAI с другими методами вычислений во время тестирования на задачах рассуждения в областях математики, программирования и здравого смысла. Исследование выявило шесть паттернов рассуждений модели o1 и проанализировало их эффективность. Результаты показывают, что o1 достигает лучших результатов на большинстве наборов данных, а также демонстрируют ограничения и преимущества различных методов улучшения рассуждений в LLM.",
