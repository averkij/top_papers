Text:"2025-1-31 SANA 1.5: Efficient Scaling of Training-Time and Inference-Time Compute in Linear Diffusion Transformer Enze Xie1* Muyang Li2 Junsong Chen1* Yuyang Zhao1 Junyu Chen3 Han Cai1 Bingchen Liu4 Daquan Zhou5 Song Han1,2 Jincheng Yu1 Ligeng Zhu1 Yujun Lin2 Zhekai Zhang2 1NVIDIA 2MIT 3Tsinghua University 4Playground 5Peking University *Equal contribution. Core contribution. Abstract: This paper presents SANA-1.5, linear Diffusion Transformer for efficient scaling in text-to-image generation. Building upon SANA-1.0, we introduce three key innovations: (1) Efficient Training Scaling: depth-growth paradigm that enables scaling from 1.6B to 4.8B parameters with significantly reduced computational resources, combined with memory-efficient 8-bit optimizer. (2) Model Depth Pruning: block importance analysis technique for efficient model compression to arbitrary sizes with minimal quality loss. (3) Inference-time Scaling: repeated sampling strategy that trades computation for model capacity, enabling smaller models to match larger model quality at inference time. Through these strategies, SANA-1.5 achieves text-image alignment score of 0.72 on GenEval, which can be further improved to 0.80 through inference scaling, establishing new SoTA on GenEval benchmark. These innovations enable efficient model scaling across different compute budgets while maintaining high quality, making high-quality image generation more accessible. Our code and pre-trained models will be released. Links: Github Code HF Models Demo Project Page 1. Introduction Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in the past year, with clear trend towards larger model sizes. Although scaling up the size of the model has proven effective in improving the quality of generation, it comes with substantial computational costs. For instance, recent industry models have grown from PixArts 0.6B parameters [1] to 24B in Playground v3 [2], resulting in prohibitive training and inference costs"
