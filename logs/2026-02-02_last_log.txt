Text:"Drive-JEPA: Video JEPA Meets Multimodal Trajectory Distillation for End-to-End Driving Linhan Wang * 1 Zichong Yang 2 Chen Bai 3 Guoxiang Zhang 3 Xiaotong Liu 3 Xiaoyin Zheng 3 Xiao-Xiao Long 4 Chang-Tien Lu 1 Cheng Lu 3 6 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 1 2 3 0 2 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r Abstract End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with simple transformerbased decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting new state-of-the-art. The code is available at https://github.com/linhanwang/Drive-JEPA. 1. Introduction End-to-end autonomous driving (Pomerleau, 1988; Chitta et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2023b) has emerged as promising paradigm that directly maps raw sensor observations to driving actions using unified neural model.

Drive-JEPA combines V-JEPA video pretraining with multimodal trajectory distillation to achieve state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end autonomous driving.  					AI-generated summary 				 End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.

**Justification:**

1. **TRANSFER_LEARNING**: The paper explicitly discusses "self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations" and describes how V-JEPA pretraining produces "predictive representations" that transfer to the autonomous driving task.

2. **SYNTHETIC**: The paper mentions "simulator-generated trajectories" that are used alongside human trajectories for training the multimodal trajectory distillation component, which constitutes the use of synthetic data for training.
