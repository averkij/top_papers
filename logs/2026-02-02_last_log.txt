[ 1 8 8 1 3 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r Haolang Lu Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications Beijing, China lhl_bupt@bupt.edu.cn Jun Xu Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence Renmin University of China Beijing, China junxu@ruc.edu.cn Abstract Deep search agents powered by large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in multi-step retrieval, reasoning, and long-horizon task execution. However, their practical failures often stem from the lack of mechanisms to monitor and regulate reasoning and retrieval states as tasks evolve. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that human metacognition is hierarchically organized, integrating fast anomaly detection with selectively triggered, experience-driven reflection. In this work, we propose Deep Search with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (DS-MCM), deep search framework augmented with an explicit hierarchical metacognitive monitoring mechanism. DS-MCM integrates Fast Consistency Monitor, which performs lightweight checks on the alignment between external evidence and internal reasoning confidence, and Slow Experience-Driven Monitor, which is selectively activated to guide corrective intervention based on experience memory from historical agent trajectories. By embedding monitoring directly into the reasoningretrieval loop, DS-MCM determines both when intervention is warranted and how corrective actions should be informed by prior experience. Experiments across multiple deep search benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate that DS-MCM consi"

Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that human metacognition is hierarchically organized, integrating fast anomaly detection with selectively triggered, experience-driven reflection. In this work, we propose Deep Search with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (DS-MCM), a deep search framework augmented with an explicit hierarchical metacognitive monitoring mechanism. DS-MCM integrates a Fast Consistency Monitor, which performs lightweight checks on the alignment between external evidence and internal reasoning confidence, and a Slow Experience-Driven Monitor, which is selectively activated to guide corrective intervention based on experience memory from historical agent trajectories. By embedding monitoring directly into the reasoning-retrieval loop, DS-MCM determines both when intervention is warranted and how corrective actions should be informed by prior experience. Experiments across multiple deep search benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate that DS-MCM consistently improves performance and robustness.

Система использует иерархический механизм метакогнитивного мониторинга, вдохновлённый нейронауками, который включает быструю проверку согласованности между доказательствами и уверенностью модели, а также медленный монитор, активируемый для корректирующих вмешательств на основе опыта из истории взаимодействий агента. Монитор встроен непосредственно в цикл рассуждения и поиска, позволяя определить моменты, когда требуется вмешательство, и направить корректирующие действия. Экспериментальная оценка на нескольких бенчмарках демонстрирует, что DS-MCM улучшает производительность и робастность агентов.",

**Justification:**

1. **REASONING**: The paper explicitly focuses on enhancing reasoning capabilities through a hierarchical metacognitive monitoring mechanism. It addresses multi-step reasoning, consistency checks, and corrective interventions to improve reasoning performance in deep search agents.

2. **INTERPRETABILITY**: The paper analyzes model behavior through monitoring mechanisms - specifically examining the alignment between external evidence and internal reasoning confidence, and tracking agent trajectories. This falls under analyzing model behavior and explanations.
