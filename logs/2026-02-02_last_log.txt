Text:"Statistical Estimation of Adversarial Risk in Large Language Models under Best-of-N Sampling Mingqian Feng * 1 Xiaodong Liu * 2 Weiwei Yang 2 Chenliang Xu 1 Christopher White 2 Jianfeng Gao 2 Abstract Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated for safety under single-shot or lowbudget adversarial prompting, which underestimates real-world risk. In practice, attackers can exploit large-scale parallel sampling to repeatedly probe model until harmful response is produced. While recent work shows that attack success increases with repeated sampling, principled methods for predicting large-scale adversarial risk remain limited. We propose scaling-aware Bestof-N estimation of risk, SABER, for modeling jailbreak vulnerability under Best-of-N sampling. We model sample-level success probabilities using Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution, and derive an analytic scaling law that enables reliable extrapolation of largeN attack success rates from small-budget measurements. Using only n=100 samples, our anchored estimator predicts ASR@1000 with mean absolute error of 1.66, compared to 12.04 for the baseline, which is an 86.2% reduction in estimation error. Our results reveal heterogeneous risk scaling profiles and show that models appearing robust under standard evaluation can experience rapid nonlinear risk amplification under parallel adversarial pressure. This work provides low-cost, scalable methodology for realistic LLM safety assessment. We will release our code and evaluation scripts upon publication to future research. 6 2 0 2 0 ] .

Text:"Qing Jin 1 Chaoyang WangRecent advances in diffusion and flow matching models have highlighted shift in the preferred prediction targetmoving from noise (ε) and velocity (v) to direct data (x) prediction particularly in high-dimensional settings. However, formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide theoretical framework based on generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which ε-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between datas geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the datas intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, framework that employs data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation. Extensive experiments in both latent-space and pixel-space image generation demonstrate that k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines across varying architectures and data scales, providing principled and automated approach to enhancing generative performance. 6 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 1 9 1 4 1 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r 1. Introduction One of the key design choices of diffusion models (SohlDickstein et al., 2015) is the network output prediction. Early works on low-dimensional data primarily utilize noise prediction (ε-prediction) (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020), paradigm that was later largely superseded by velocity *Equal contribution Project lead 1Independent Researcher. Correspondence to: Qing Jin <jinqingking@gmail.com>. Preprint.

Most recently, research into high-resolution generationparticularly for models operating directly in pixel spacehas revealed that predicting the clean data (x-prediction) often yields superior results and enhanced stability compared to other options (Hoogeboom et al., 2024; Li & He, 2025; Hafner et al., 2025). This empirical shift suggests that as we scale models to higher resolutions and more complex data distributions, the optimal choice of prediction target is not static but evolves with the task. Despite these empirical advancements, the theoretical landscape remains fragmented, leaving several fundamental questions unanswered. First, it is unclear whether the optimal prediction target is strictly confined to the conventional triad of ε, v, and x, or if superior alternatives exist within more expansive, generalized objective space. For instance, in low-dimensional settings, it remains unproven whether vprediction represents universal optimum; conversely, for high-dimensional data, we lack definitive answer as to whether x-prediction is an indispensable requirement. Second, the field lacks rigorous theoretical explanation for how data dimensionality fundamentally dictates the efficiency and stability of these targets. While prior literature has invoked the manifold hypothesis to qualitatively justify x-prediction for sparse, high-dimensional data (Li & He, 2025), such conceptual frameworks are insufficient for rigorous analysis and cannot substitute for formal quantitative description. This absence of mathematical precision leads to further ambiguity: whether direct, quantifiable relationship exists between the datas ambient or intrinsic dimension and its optimal prediction target, and if so, whether the latter can be analytically derived from the former. Indeed, the precise mechanism by which the optimal target shifts from v-prediction toward x-prediction as dimensionality increases remains unknown. Finally, from practical standpoint, there remains no principled methodology to determine the ideal target for given dataset. Currently, researchers and practitioners are forced to rely on computationally expensive heuristic-driven searches or trial-anderror, which hampers the efficiency of model development for novel high-dimensional domains. In this work, we systematically address these gaps through Revisiting Diffusion Model Predictions Through Dimensionality novel theoretical and algorithmic framework. To this end, we first introduce generic formalism that accommodates prediction targets of arbitrary functional forms, treating standard targets as specific instances of unified objective. To gain fundamental insights into the training process, we analyze much simplified diffusion model, which consists of single linear layer tasked to learn across the entire spectrum of Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) of the diffusion process. Surprisingly, such an SNR-invariant linear model exhibits remarkably rich learning dynamics, offering tractable yet powerful lens through which to examine the interplay between data dimensionality and prediction targets. Specifically, the optimization dynamics decouple into two distinct modes: parallel mode aligned with the data manifold and perpendicular mode orthogonal to it. Notably, we demonstrate that these two modes exhibit fundamentally different learning behaviors; while the parallel mode is governed by data recovery, the perpendicular mode is dominated by noise elimination. Since the relative contribution of these two modes is governed by the datasets dimensionality, fixed prediction targetchosen without regard for these geometric propertiesis inherently suboptimal. To further investigate the quantitative relationship between dimensionality and the optimal prediction objective, we introduce generalized target formulation: = kx(1k)n with 0 1. While mathematically concise, this expression defines continuous objective space that naturally encompasses conventional targets as discrete points along the spectrum; specifically, = 0, = 0.5, and = 1 recover ε-, v-, and x-prediction, respectively (up to constant scaling factor). By optimizing the loss with respect to the parameter k, we derive the optimal target configuration as function of both the intrinsic and ambient dimension of the data. This derivation establishes formal, quantitative bridge between the geo"

Text:"Ziwei Liu 1 Borui Kang 1 Hangjie Yuan 2 Zixiang Zhao 3 Wei Li 1 Yifan Zhu 4 Tao Feng 1 6 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 2 2 3 7 0 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r Abstract As digital environments (data distribution) are in flux, with new GUI data arriving over time introducing new domains or resolutionsagents trained on static environments deteriorate in performance. In this work, we introduce Continual GUI Agents, new task that requires GUI agents to perform continual learning under shifted domains and resolutions. We find existing methods fail to maintain stable grounding as GUI distributions shift over time, due to the diversity of UI interaction points and regions in fluxing scenarios. To address this, we introduce GUI-Anchoring in Flux (GUI-AiF), new reinforcement finetuning framework that stabilizes continual learning through two novel rewards: Anchoring Point Reward in Flux (APR-iF) and Anchoring Region Reward in Flux (ARR-iF). These rewards guide the agents to align with shifting interaction points and regions, mitigating the tendency of existing reward strategies to over-adapt to static grounding cues (e.g., fixed coordinates or element scales). Extensive experiments show GUI-AiF surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. Our work establishes the first continual learning framework for GUI agents, revealing the untapped potential of reinforcement fine-tuning for continual GUI Agents. 1. Introduction Autonomous GUI agents empower users to perform actions in various digital applications through natural language instructions, such as clicking icons or locating items within an interface (Hong et al., 2024; Guan et al., 2025). The core underlying this process is grounding (Feng et al., 2022), which refers to mapping textual instructions to precise pixel coordiWork was done during an internship at Tsinghua University. 1Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, China 2College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, China 3Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Lab, ETH Zurich, S"

Frequency-domain analysis of diffusion language models reveals that low-frequency components encode global structure while high-frequency components capture local details, enabling improved generation through FourierSampler's dynamic frequency-domain sliding window mechanism.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite the non-autoregressive potential of diffusion language models (dLLMs), existing decoding strategies demonstrate positional bias, failing to fully unlock the potential of arbitrary generation. In this work, we delve into the inherent spectral characteristics of dLLMs and present the first frequency-domain analysis showing that low-frequency components in hidden states primarily encode global structural information and long-range dependencies, while high-frequency components are responsible for characterizing local details. Based on this observation, we propose FourierSampler, which leverages a frequency-domain sliding window mechanism to dynamically guide the model to achieve a "structure-to-detail" generation. FourierSampler outperforms other inference enhancement strategies on LLADA and SDAR, achieving relative improvements of 20.4% on LLaDA1.5-8B and 16.0% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct.

A scaling-aware risk estimation method called SABER is introduced for predicting large-scale adversarial vulnerability in language models through Best-of-N sampling, enabling accurate assessment with reduced computational costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated for safety under single-shot or low-budget adversarial prompting, which underestimates real-world risk. In practice, attackers can exploit large-scale parallel sampling to repeatedly probe a model until a harmful response is produced. While recent work shows that attack success increases with repeated sampling, principled methods for predicting large-scale adversarial risk remain limited. We propose a scaling-aware Best-of-N estimation of risk, SABER, for modeling jailbreak vulnerability under Best-of-N sampling. We model sample-level success probabilities using a Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution, and derive an analytic scaling law that enables reliable extrapolation of large-N attack success rates from small-budget measurements. Using only n=100 samples, our anchored estimator predicts ASR@1000 with a mean absolute error of 1.66, compared to 12.04 for the baseline, which is an 86.2% reduction in estimation error. Our results reveal heterogeneous risk scaling profiles and show that models appearing robust under standard evaluation can experience rapid nonlinear risk amplification under parallel adversarial pressure. This work provides a low-cost, scalable methodology for realistic LLM safety assessment. We will release our code and evaluation scripts upon publication to future research.

Diffusion models using direct data prediction outperform traditional noise or velocity prediction in high-dimensional settings, with a proposed framework automatically learning optimal prediction parameters from data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in diffusion and flow matching models have highlighted a shift in the preferred prediction target -- moving from noise (varepsilon) and velocity (v) to direct data (x) prediction -- particularly in high-dimensional settings. However, a formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which varepsilon-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, a framework that employs a data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation. Extensive experiments in both latent-space and pixel-space image generation demonstrate that k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines across varying architectures and data scales, providing a principled and automated approach to enhancing generative performance.

"Diffusion models using direct data prediction outperform traditional noise or velocity prediction in high-dimensional settings, with a proposed framework automatically learning optimal prediction parameters from data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in diffusion and flow matching models have highlighted a shift in the preferred prediction target -- moving from noise (varepsilon) and velocity (v) to direct data (x) prediction -- particularly in high-dimensional settings. However, a formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which varepsilon-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, a framework that employs a data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation. Extensive experiments in both latent-space and pixel-space image generation demonstrate that k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines across varying architectures and data scales, providing a principled and automated approach to enhancing generative performance."

A framework called Fission-GRPO is introduced to improve multi-turn tool execution in large language models by converting execution errors into corrective supervision during reinforcement learning training.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) can call tools effectively, yet they remain brittle in multi-turn execution: following a tool call error, smaller models often degenerate into repetitive invalid re-invocations, failing to interpret error feedback and self-correct. This brittleness hinders reliable real-world deployment, where the execution errors are inherently inevitable during tool interaction procedures. We identify a key limitation of current approaches: standard reinforcement learning (RL) treats errors as sparse negative rewards, providing no guidance on how to recover, while pre-collected synthetic error-correction datasets suffer from distribution mismatch with the model's on-policy error modes. To bridge this gap, we propose Fission-GRPO, a framework that converts execution errors into corrective supervision within the RL training loop. Our core mechanism fissions each failed trajectory into a new training instance by augmenting it with diagnostic feedback from a finetuned Error Simulator, then resampling recovery rollouts on-policy. This enables the model to learn from the precise errors it makes during exploration, rather than from static, pre-collected error cases. On the BFCL v4 Multi-Turn, Fission-GRPO improves the error recovery rate of Qwen3-8B by 5.7% absolute, crucially, yielding a 4% overall accuracy gain (42.75% to 46.75%) over GRPO and outperforming specialized tool-use agents.

A Bayesian Optimization approach using Gaussian Processes automates scheduling configuration optimization on heterogeneous multi-core systems while approximating the Pareto Frontier for energy-time trade-offs.

Traditional heuristic tuning is often inefficient in such high-dimensional, non-smooth landscapes. In this work, we propose a Bayesian Optimization framework using Gaussian Processes to automate the search for optimal scheduling configurations on heterogeneous multi-core architectures. We explicitly address the multi-objective nature of the problem by approximating the Pareto Frontier between energy and time. Furthermore, by incorporating Sensitivity Analysis (fANOVA) and comparing different covariance kernels (e.g., Matérn vs. RBF), we provide physical interpretability to the black-box model, revealing the dominant hardware parameters driving system performance.

Continual GUI Agents framework addresses performance degradation in dynamic digital environments through reinforcement fine-tuning with novel anchoring rewards that stabilize learning across shifting UI domains and resolutions.  					AI-generated summary 				 As digital environments (data distribution) are in flux, with new GUI data arriving over time-introducing new domains or resolutions-agents trained on static environments deteriorate in performance. In this work, we introduce Continual GUI Agents, a new task that requires GUI agents to perform continual learning under shifted domains and resolutions. We find existing methods fail to maintain stable grounding as GUI distributions shift over time, due to the diversity of UI interaction points and regions in fluxing scenarios. To address this, we introduce GUI-Anchoring in Flux (GUI-AiF), a new reinforcement fine-tuning framework that stabilizes continual learning through two novel rewards: Anchoring Point Reward in Flux (APR-iF) and Anchoring Region Reward in Flux (ARR-iF). These rewards guide the agents to align with shifting interaction points and regions, mitigating the tendency of existing reward strategies to over-adapt to static grounding cues (e.g., fixed coordinates or element scales). Extensive experiments show GUI-AiF surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. Our work establishes the first continual learning framework for GUI agents, revealing the untapped potential of reinforcement fine-tuning for continual GUI Agents.
