Text:"Quartet II: Accurate LLM Pre-Training in NVFP4 by Improved Unbiased Gradient Estimation Andrei Panferov 1 Erik Schultheis 1 Soroush Tabesh 1 Dan Alistarh 1 2 6 2 0 2 0 3 ] . [ 1 3 1 8 2 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r aThe NVFP4 lower-precision format, supported in hardware by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, promises to allow, for the first time, end-to-end fullyquantized pre-training of massive models such as LLMs. Yet, existing quantized training methods still sacrifice some of the representation capacity of this format in favor of more accurate unbiased quantized gradient estimation by stochastic rounding (SR), losing noticeable accuracy relative to standard FP16 and FP8 training. In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into novel fully-NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers, called Quartet II. We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications, both on the forward and on the backward passes. In addition, our proposal synergizes well with recent training improvements aimed specifically at NVFP4. We further validate Quartet II on end-to-end LLM training with up to 1.9B parameters on 38B tokens. We provide kernels for execution on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs with up to 4.2x speedup over BF16. Our code is available at https://github. com/IST-DASLab/Quartet-II. 1. Introduction The computational cost of training state-of-the-art foundation models has been increasing at roughly exponential pace, putting into question the sustainability of the area, e.g. (Amodei & Hernandez, 2018; Sevilla et al., 2022). Pretraining modern Transformer-based foundation values is dominated by dense matrix multiplications (GEMMs), e.g. the linear projections in attention and MLPs, and so, reduc1Institute of Science and Technology Austria 2Red Hat AI. Correspondence to: Dan Alistarh <Dan.Alistarh@ist.ac.at>. Preprint. February 2, 2026. 1 ing the precision of these GEMMs is one of the most direct levers for lowering end-to-end training costs. This motivation has driven steady progression of mixedprecision training recipes, from FP16/BF16 to FP8 (Micikevicius et al., 2022), and now toward 4-bit microscaling floating point formats such as MXFP and NVFP. In these formats, values are stored in 4-bit floating-point encoding, but each small block is accompanied by higher-precision, e.g. FP8, scale, preserving dynamic range while enabling tensor-core acceleration. Recent GPU accelerators provide native support for such formats, with 2-4x throughput gains over FP8 for individual matmuls (NVIDIA, 2024). The key challenge is to retain FP16/FP8-quality optimization while performing most operations at 4-bit precision (Xi et al., 2023; Chmiel et al., 2024). At this scale, naive quantization leads to divergence over long pre-training runs. Emerging work on stable FP4 native training (Tseng et al., 2025; Castro et al., 2025; Chmiel et al., 2025) has converged on two guiding principles. First, the forward pass should seek to maximize representation capacity by minimizing the quantization error of activations and weights, typically measured via mean-square error (MSE). Second, the backward pass is especially sensitive to bias: as such, biased gradient estimators can accumulate systematic error over many steps, making unbiased (or carefully controlled) gradient quantization essential for stable convergence. These insights underpinned NVIDIAs first end-to-end NVFP4 pre-training recipe (NVIDIA et al., 2025) and subsequent refinements, including forward-pass scale selection heuristics (Cook et al., 2025) and improved NVFP4 stability mechanisms (Chen et al., 2025b). Yet, current state-of-the-art FP4 recipes still drop significant accuracy relative to FP8 and FP16. Contributions. In this paper, we improve the current state of the art for NVFP4 native training by revisiting the question of unbiased gradient estimation for the NVFP4 microscaling format. Surprisingly, we show that the prevailing prior solution, element-wise FP4 stochastic rounding (SR), can be significantly improved. We do so by introducing new unbiased quantization routine for microscaling formats, called MicroScaling EDEN (MS-EDEN), that reduces quantization error by moving the stochasticity from individual FP4 values to the microscale factors, while retaining provable unbiasedness in expectation. Based on MS-EDEN, we Quartet II: Accurate LLM Pre-Training in NVFP4 by Improved Unbiased Gradient Estimation build Quartet II, fully-NVFP4 linear-layer computation graph that combines (i) high-capacity forward pass using native NVFP4 scaling augmented with the Four-over-Six scale selection heuristic (Cook et al., 2025), with (ii) an unbiased backward pass based on MS-EDEN and efficient inner-dimension randomized block rotations. We provide an analytic comparison showing that Quartet II yields consistently improved gradient estimation across the major matrix multiplications in transformer training, and we validate these improvements in end-to-end LLM pre-training. Finally, we provide kernels enabling efficient execution on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, making the proposed recipe practical at scale. In summary, our contributions are as follows: new unbiased quantization primitive called MSEDEN tailored to microscaling FP4 formats that substantially reduces quantization error relative to FP4 stochastic rounding while remaining hardwarecompatible and efficient. fully-NVFP4 linear-layer training graph called Quartet II that combines improved forward-pass quantization with improved unbiased backward-pass quantization (MS-EDEN), yielding better gradient estimates. Empirical validation: we perform extensive ablations and end-to-end accuracy validation via training runs showing consistent accuracy improvements over prior NVFP4 recipes. Efficient kernels: we show that our scheme is efficiently implementable on the NVIDIA Blackwell generation of GPUs, with up to 4.2x speedup vs BF16. 2. Related Work Lower-precision training. Low-precision training is longstanding direction in deep learning, e.g. (Courbariaux et al., 2015; Esser et al., 2019; Panferov et al., 2025a; Micikevicius et al., 2022; Hernandez-Cano et al., 2025).

Quantized training method Quartet II improves NVFP4 format utilization for large language model pre-training through enhanced gradient estimation and faster GPU execution.  					AI-generated summary 				 The NVFP4 lower-precision format, supported in hardware by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, promises to allow, for the first time, end-to-end fully-quantized pre-training of massive models such as LLMs. Yet, existing quantized training methods still sacrifice some of the representation capacity of this format in favor of more accurate unbiased quantized gradient estimation by stochastic rounding (SR), losing noticeable accuracy relative to standard FP16 and FP8 training. In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into a novel fully-NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers, called Quartet II. We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications, both on the forward and on the backward passes. In addition, our proposal synergizes well with recent training improvements aimed specifically at NVFP4. We further validate Quartet II on end-to-end LLM training with up to 1.9B parameters on 38B tokens. We provide kernels for execution on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs with up to 4.2x speedup over BF16. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/Quartet-II .

"Quantized training method Quartet II improves NVFP4 format utilization for large language model pre-training through enhanced gradient estimation and faster GPU execution.  					AI-generated summary 				 The NVFP4 lower-precision format, supported in hardware by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, promises to allow, for the first time, end-to-end fully-quantized pre-training of massive models such as LLMs. Yet, existing quantized training methods still sacrifice some of the representation capacity of this format in favor of more accurate unbiased quantized gradient estimation by stochastic rounding (SR), losing noticeable accuracy relative to standard FP16 and FP8 training. In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into a novel fully-NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers, called Quartet II. We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications, both on the forward and on the backward passes. In addition, our proposal synergizes well with recent training improvements aimed specifically at NVFP4. We further validate Quartet II on end-to-end LLM training with up to 1.9B parameters on 38B tokens. We provide kernels for execution on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs with up to 4.2x speedup over BF16. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/Quartet-II ."
