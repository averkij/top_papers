Text:"ExpAlign: Expectation-Guided VisionLanguage Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Grounding Junyi Hu 1 Tian Bai 2 3 Fengyi Wu 2 Wenyan Li 4 Zhenming Peng 2 Yi ZhangOpen-vocabulary grounding requires accurate vision-language alignment under weak supervision, yet existing methods either rely on global sentence embeddings that lack fine-grained expressiveness or introduce token-level alignment with explicit supervision or heavy cross-attention designs. We propose ExpAlign, theoretically grounded vision-language alignment framework built on principled multiple instance learning formulation. ExpAlign introduces an Expectation Alignment Head that performs attentionbased soft MIL pooling over token-region similarities, enabling implicit token and instance selection without additional annotations. To further stabilize alignment learning, we develop an energy-based multi-scale consistency regularization scheme, including Top-K multi-positive contrastive objective and Geometry-Aware Consistency Objective derived from Lagrangianconstrained free-energy minimization. Extensive experiments show that ExpAlign consistently improves open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot instance segmentation, particularly on long-tail categories. Most notably, it achieves 36.2 APr on the LVIS minival split, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods at comparable model scale, while remaining lightweight and inferenceefficient. 6 2 0 2 0 3 ] .

Introduction Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable powerful zero-shot transfer by aligning images and texts in shared embedding space (Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023; Jia et al., 2021). Despite significant progress, precise spatial grounding, which involves localizing free-form textual 1Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, China 2University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, China 3Lingsu Lab, China 4University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Correspondence to: Yi Zhang <zhyi@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn>. Preprint. February 2, 2026. concepts within images, remains key challenge in dense prediction tasks such as open-vocabulary detection and segmentation (Kamath et al., 2021; Cai et al., 2022). Recent open-vocabulary methods (Liu et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025; Fu et al., 2025) alleviate vocabulary constraints but often struggle with complex linguistic phenomena, including negation, relations, and compositional descriptions, when fine-grained localization is required. Recent theoretical analysis reveals an inherent limitation of CLIP-style joint embeddings: collapsing prompt into single global representation cannot simultaneously encode attribute binding, spatial relations, and negation under cosine similarity (Kang et al., 2025b). This geometric bottleneck motivates token-level vision-language alignment, where informative tokens are selectively emphasized rather than uniformly aggregated. However, incorporating tokenlevel reasoning into dense grounding remains nontrivial due to weak supervision and optimization instability. We propose ExpAlign, an expectation-guided visionlanguage alignment framework for open-vocabulary grounding. At its core is the Expectation Alignment Head (EAH), which produces prompt-conditioned spatial alignment maps by aggregating token-wise similarities through soft expectation mechanism. By treating spatial locations as latent instances and textual tokens as competing hypotheses, EAH performs implicit token selection without instance-level annotations, admitting natural interpretation as attentionbased soft pooling in multiple instance learning (MIL) (Ilse et al., 2018). To further improve discriminability and spatial coherence, we introduce two auxiliary objectives. multi-positive InfoNCE loss enforces prompt-level semantic separation under weak supervision, while Geometry-Aware Consistency Objective (GACO) regularizes alignment maps by emphasizing relatively consistent regions within each ground-truth mask. Together, they stabilize optimization and support both positive and negative prompts. Experiments on LVIS (Gupta et al., 2019), ODinW (Li et al., 2022), and RefCOCO/+/g (Yu et al., 2016) show that ExpAlign delivers strong open-vocabulary detection and segmentation performance under similar pre-training ExpAlign: Expectation-Guided VisionLanguage Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Grounding scale and model capacity to recent baselines. It achieves competitive or superior results on LVIS rare categories and ODinW subsets, while on RefCOCO/+/g it outperforms detection-focused methods such as YOLOE but trails specialized grounding models like Grounding DINO-T due to CLIPs limited spatial reasoning. dition, geometry-aware regularization has been explored in segmentation and structured prediction (Liang et al., 2021), but existing approaches typically rely on absolute geometric cues. In contrast, our geometry-aware consistency objective operates on relative instance statistics, encouraging coherent alignment without rigid spatial targets. 2. Related Work Sentence-level vision-language Alignment. visionlanguage pretraining methods such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and BLIP (Li et al., 2023) align whole images with global text embeddings using contrastive objectives. These sentence-level alignment techniques have enabled strong zero-shot transfer for retrieval and classification, and have been adapted to open-vocabulary detection by using prompt embeddings as classifier proxies (Zhou et al., 2022). However, collapsing prompt into single vector can lose internal structure and limits fine-grained localization, motivating methods that exploit richer textual and visual interactions. Token-level and Phrase-level Alignment. To capture fine-grained semantics between language and vision, several works explicitly model interactions at the token or phrase level. For instance, GLIP and its variants unify localization and grounding by introducing region-word contrastive alignment and phrase grounding objectives that align phrases with corresponding image regions (Zhang et al., 2022), enabling the model to learn regiontoken correspondences beyond global text embeddings. Methods like X-VLM perform multi-grained visionlanguage pretraining that aligns text with visual concepts at varying granularities, leveraging patch-level or concept-level representations (Zeng et al., 2021). Works in temporal grounding also observe that treating all tokens uniformly under cross-modal attention fails to exploit word-le"

[ 1 6 2 5 1 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r KAPSO: Knowledge-grounded framework for Autonomous Program Synthesis and Optimization Alireza Nadaf Alireza Mohammadshahi Majid Yazdani Leeroo Team {nadaf, alireza, my}@leeroo.com Abstract We introduce KAPSO, modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given natural-language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes. KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agentsincluding lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertiseby integrating three tightly coupled components. First, git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence. We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance. Domain experts often know what they want to build, but turning that intent into reliable, runnable, and optimized software still requires repeated experimentation. In practice, successful development is an iterative process: "

ExpAlign presents a vision-language alignment framework using multiple instance learning and attention-based pooling to improve open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot instance segmentation without additional annotations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Open-vocabulary grounding requires accurate vision-language alignment under weak supervision, yet existing methods either rely on global sentence embeddings that lack fine-grained expressiveness or introduce token-level alignment with explicit supervision or heavy cross-attention designs. We propose ExpAlign, a theoretically grounded vision-language alignment framework built on a principled multiple instance learning formulation. ExpAlign introduces an Expectation Alignment Head that performs attention-based soft MIL pooling over token-region similarities, enabling implicit token and instance selection without additional annotations. To further stabilize alignment learning, we develop an energy-based multi-scale consistency regularization scheme, including a Top-K multi-positive contrastive objective and a Geometry-Aware Consistency Objective derived from a Lagrangian-constrained free-energy minimization. Extensive experiments show that ExpAlign consistently improves open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot instance segmentation, particularly on long-tail categories. Most notably, it achieves 36.2 AP_r on the LVIS minival split, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods at comparable model scale, while remaining lightweight and inference-efficient.

KAPSO is a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis that uses iterative optimization loops with experimentation tracking, knowledge integration, and cognitive memory to improve code generation over extended tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce KAPSO, a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes.   KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence.   We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.
