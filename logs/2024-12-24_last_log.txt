[ 1 5 0 8 7 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r aLearning robust video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is essential for reducing video redundancy and facilitating efficient video generation. Directly applying image VAEs to individual frames in isolation can result in temporal inconsistencies and suboptimal compression rates due to lack of temporal compression. Existing Video VAEs have begun to address temporal compression; however, they often suffer from inadequate reconstruction performance. In this paper, we present novel and powerful video autoencoder capable of high-fidelity video encoding. First, we observe that entangling spatial and temporal compression by merely extending the image VAE to 3D VAE can introduce motion blur and detail distortion artifacts. Thus, we propose temporal-aware spatial compression to better encode and decode the spatial information. Additionally, we integrate lightweight motion compression model for further temporal compression. Second, we propose to leverage the textual information inherent in text-to-video datasets and incorporate text guidance into our model. This significantly enhances reconstruction quality, particularly in terms of detail preservation and temporal stability. Third, we further improve the versatility of our model through joint training on both images and videos, which not only enhances reconstruction quality but also enables the model to perform both image and video autoencoding. Extensive evaluations against strong recent baselines demonstrate the superior performance of our method. The project website can be found at https://yzxing87.github.io/vae/. 1. Introduction Given the significant attention in the field of video generation, Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) [4, 5, 7, 14, 36] have emerged as popular framework. They have been successfully applied to powerful text-to-video models such as Sora [6], VideoCrafter [7, 8], and CogVideoX [31]. Different from directly generating video pixels, LVDMs gen- *equal contribution corresponding authors erate latent video representations in compact latent space. This is achieved by first training Video VAE to encode videos into this latent space. Thus, Video VAE, as key and fundamental component of LVDMs, has attracted great attention recently. An effective Video VAE can help to reduce the training costs of video diffusion models while improving the final quality of the generated videos. Initially, series of studies adopt the image VAE from Stable Diffusion [25] for video generation tasks, including AnimateDiff [13], MagicVideo [36], VideoCrafter1 [7], and VideoCrafter2 [8]. However, directly adopting an image VAE and compressing video on frame-by-frame basis leads to temporal flickering due to the lack of temporal correlation. Additionally, the information redundancy along the temporal dimension is not reduced, leading to low training efficiency for subsequent latent video diffusion models. From the introduction of Sora, which compresses videos both temporally and spatially through Video VAE, series of studies have emerged that aim to replicate Sora and train their own Video VAEs, including Open Sora [35], Open Sora Plan [19], CV-VAE [34], CogVideoX [31], EasyAnimate [30], and Cosmos Tokenizer [23]. However, the performance of the current video VAE suffers from many problems, including motion ghost, low-level temporal flickering, blurring (faces, hands, edges, texts), and motion stuttering (lack of correct temporal transition). In this work, we propose novel cross-modal Video VAE with better spatial and temporal modeling ability in order to solve the aforementioned challenge problems and obtain robust and high-quality Video VAE. First, we examine different designs for spatial and temporal compression, including simultaneous spatial-temporal (ST) compression and sequential ST compression. We observed that simultaneous ST compression achieves better low-level temporal smoothness and texture stability, while sequential ST compression achieves better motion recovery, particularly in scenarios of large motion. Thus, we propose novel architecture that integrates the advantages of both methods and enables effective video detail and motion reconstruction. Second, we observed that the normally used datasets for text-to-video generation contain text-video pairs. Also, dur1 Figure 1. Our reconstruction results compared with line of three recent strong baseline approaches. The ground truth frame is (0). Our model significantly outperforms previous methods, especially under large motion scenarios such as people doing sports. ing decoding, text description exists as it serves as the input in the first stage, i.e., the video latent generation stage. To this end, we integrate the text information into the encoding and decoding procedure and propose the first Crossmodal Video VAE. We carefully study how text guidance can be integrated into the spatiotemporal backbone and the mechanism of spatial and temporal semantic guidance. In addition, our cross-modal video VAE supports imagevideo joint training. To achieve this, we design our network with fully spatiotemporal factorized architecture, and we feed image and video batches alternately to the network. During image batches, the data only forwards the spatial part of the network, with the temporal modules being skipped. During video batches, the video forwards both spatial and temporal modules. We also demonstrate that image joint training is crucial for training video VAE. In summary, our contributions are as follows: We propose an effective and robust Video VAE, conduct extensive experiments, and achieve the state-of-the-art. We propose an optimal spatiotemporal modeling approach for Video VAE. We propose the first cross-modal video VAE that leverages the information from other modalities, i.e., text descriptions, to the best of our knowledge. 2 Our video VAE is designed and trained to be versatile to conduct both image and video compression. 2.

Discrete video VAEs compress videos into discrete tokens by learning codebook for quantization and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction, as demonstrated by models like MAGVIT-v2 [32]. However, these VAEs are not suitable fo"
