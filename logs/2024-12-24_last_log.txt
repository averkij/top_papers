Text:"goo.gle/LearnLM-dec24 2024-12-19 LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning LearnLM Team, Google Todays generative AI systems are tuned to present information by default rather than engage users in service of learning as human tutor would. To address the wide range of potential education use cases for these systems, we reframe the challenge of injecting pedagogical behavior as one of pedagogical instruction following, where training and evaluation examples include system-level instructions describing the specific pedagogy attributes present or desired in subsequent model turns. This framing avoids committing our models to any particular definition of pedagogy, and instead allows teachers or developers to specify desired model behavior. It also clears path to improving Gemini models for learningby enabling the addition of our pedagogical data to post-training mixturesalongside their rapidly expanding set of capabilities. Both represent important changes from our initial tech report [1]. We show how training with pedagogical instruction following produces LearnLM model (available on Google AI Studio) that is preferred substantially by expert raters across diverse set of learning scenarios, with average preference strengths of 31% over GPT-4o, 11% over Claude 3.5, and 13% over the Gemini 1.5 Pro model LearnLM was based on. 1. Introduction Our initial tech report [1] from May 2024 surveyed the history and current landscape of education technology, discussed the potential impact of generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) on education, and presented our collaborative approach to developing evaluations. Following its publication, we received input from across the international education sector, including schools, educational technology (EdTech) companies, non-profit organizations, and government agencies eager to try our models or otherwise collaborate. Through review of these submissions, over 20 follow-up interviews, and input from Google product teams building gen AI po"

Text:"OpenAI o1 System Card OpenAI December 5, 2024 4 2 0 2 1 2 ] . [ 1 0 2 7 6 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r The o1 model series is trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using chain of thought. These advanced reasoning capabilities provide new avenues for improving the safety and robustness of our models. In particular, our models can reason about our safety policies in context when responding to potentially unsafe prompts, through deliberative alignment[1]1. This leads to state-of-the-art performance on certain benchmarks for risks such as generating illicit advice, choosing stereotyped responses, and succumbing to known jailbreaks. Training models to incorporate chain of thought before answering has the potential to unlock substantial benefits, while also increasing potential risks that stem from heightened intelligence. Our results underscore the need for building robust alignment methods, extensively stress-testing their efficacy, and maintaining meticulous risk management protocols. This report outlines the safety work carried out for the OpenAI o1 and OpenAI o1-mini models, including safety evaluations, external red teaming, and Preparedness Framework evaluations. The o1 large language model family is trained with reinforcement learning to perform complex reasoning. o1 thinks before it answersit can produce long chain of thought before responding to the user. OpenAI o1 is the next model in this series (previously OpenAI o1-preview), while OpenAI o1-mini is faster version of this model that is particularly effective at coding. Through training, the models learn to refine their thinking process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes. Reasoning allows o1 models to follow specific guidelines and model policies weve set, helping them act in line with our safety expectations. This means they are better at providing helpful answers and resisting attempts to bypass safety rules, to avoid producing unsafe or inappropriate content. The two models were "

Recently, O1-like models have emerged as representative examples, illustrating the effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) in reasoning tasks such as math and coding tasks. In this paper, we introduce DRT-o1, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT). Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by an advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is also employed to judge whether the translation in the current round is better than the previous one or not. In this manner, we collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT-o1. The experimental results on literature translation demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRT-o1. Using Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-14B as the backbones, the improvement brought by DRT-o1 achieves 7.33~8.26 BLEU and 1.66~3.36 CometScore. Besides, DRT-o1-7B can outperform QwQ-32B-Preview by 7.82 BLEU and 1.46 CometScore, showing its effectiveness. The project is available at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT-o1

"Recently, O1-like models have emerged as representative examples, illustrating the effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) in reasoning tasks such as math and coding tasks. In this paper, we introduce DRT-o1, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT). Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by an advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is also employed to judge whether the translation in the current round is better than the previous one or not. In this manner, we collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT-o1. The experimental results on literature translation demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRT-o1. Using Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-14B as the backbones, the improvement brought by DRT-o1 achieves 7.33~8.26 BLEU and 1.66~3.36 CometScore. Besides, DRT-o1-7B can outperform QwQ-32B-Preview by 7.82 BLEU and 1.46 CometScore, showing its effectiveness. The project is available at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT-o1"

Today's generative AI systems are tuned to present information by default rather than engage users in service of learning as a human tutor would. To address the wide range of potential education use cases for these systems, we reframe the challenge of injecting pedagogical behavior as one of pedagogical instruction following, where training and evaluation examples include system-level instructions describing the specific pedagogy attributes present or desired in subsequent model turns. This framing avoids committing our models to any particular definition of pedagogy, and instead allows teachers or developers to specify desired model behavior. It also clears a path to improving Gemini models for learning -- by enabling the addition of our pedagogical data to post-training mixtures -- alongside their rapidly expanding set of capabilities. Both represent important changes from our initial tech report. We show how training with pedagogical instruction following produces a LearnLM model (available on Google AI Studio) that is preferred substantially by expert raters across a diverse set of learning scenarios, with average preference strengths of 31\% over GPT-4o, 11\% over Claude 3.5, and 13\% over the Gemini 1.5 Pro model LearnLM was based on.

The o1 model series is trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using chain of thought. These advanced reasoning capabilities provide new avenues for improving the safety and robustness of our models. In particular, our models can reason about our safety policies in context when responding to potentially unsafe prompts, through deliberative alignment. This leads to state-of-the-art performance on certain benchmarks for risks such as generating illicit advice, choosing stereotyped responses, and succumbing to known jailbreaks. Training models to incorporate a chain of thought before answering has the potential to unlock substantial benefits, while also increasing potential risks that stem from heightened intelligence. Our results underscore the need for building robust alignment methods, extensively stress-testing their efficacy, and maintaining meticulous risk management protocols. This report outlines the safety work carried out for the OpenAI o1 and OpenAI o1-mini models, including safety evaluations, external red teaming, and Preparedness Framework evaluations.
