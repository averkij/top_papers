Our analysis reveals that existing hallucination detection methods struggle with detailed captions. We attribute this to the increasing reliance of MLLMs on their generated text, rather than the input image, as the sequence length grows. To address this issue, we propose multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLMs performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions. 1. Introduction Numerous image captioning methods utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proposed (Vinyals et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015). However, they are generally limited to generating short captions, which constrains their broader application in real-world scenarios. For instance, in cases such as assistance for visually impaired individuals, where it is necessary to provide highly detailed descriptions of the scene in front of the user, these methods may not be suitable. *Work done during internship at Adobe Research. 1Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University 2Adobe Research 3Interdisciplinary Program in Artificial Intelligence, Seoul National University. Correspondence to: Sungroh Yoon <sryoon@snu.ac.kr>. 1 Following the recent success of large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020), there have been attempts to use text and information from other modalities as input to LLMs. Notably, many studies have explored multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that incorporate visual information (Li et al., 2023a; Dai et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b). These models have demonstrated significantly superior performance compared to traditional models in tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and captioning (Liu et al., 2024a). In particular, MLLMs, leveraging the advanced language capabilities of LLMs, are able to generate much longer and more detailed captions than conventional captioning models. However, these generated captions frequently contain inaccurate information, including descriptions of objects that are not present in the input image (Leng et al., 2024). Such hallucination problems hinder the practical application of MLLMs in real-world settings. Three major approaches have been recently proposed to improve the factuality of MLLMs: (i) Decoding-based methods (Leng et al., 2024) reduce the probabilities of hallucinationrelated tokens during the models decoding process without requiring additional training; (ii) Training-based methods (Liu et al., 2023a) further train the models on curated multimodal datasets to ensure they generate only accurate responses; (iii) Corrector-based methods (Zhou et al., 2024) employ corrector model that detects and either removes or revises hallucinations present in the models responses. In this paper, we propose Caption factuality enhancing MultiAgent System (CapMAS), multiagent approach to correct hyper-detailed image captions. Unlike existing corrector-based approaches that require training corrector (Lee et al., 2024), CapMAS improves the factuality of detailed image captions by leveraging the collaboration between an LLM and MLLM, without the need for additional training. Moreover, unlike methods that target specific types of hallucinations (Li et al., 2023b; Zhou et al., 2024), our approach does not pre-define the hallucination types, allowing it to address broader range of issues. The method proceeds as follows: (i) an LLM decomposes given detailed caption into atomic propositions; (ii) an MLLM verifies the truthfulness of each atomic proposition based on the image; and (iii) the LLM revises the caption accordingly. Our design is parSubmission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2025 ticularly motivated by the observation that, as the length of models response increases, hallucinations generated later in the sequence become more difficult for existing methods (Wang et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024) to detect. Evaluating the factuality of detailed captions is not straightforward. Through experiments, we demonstrate that conventional caption evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), METEOR (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005), and CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015), as well as recently proposed methods (Hessel et al., 2021; Petryk et al., 2024), fail to accurately assess the factuality of detailed captions. To address this issue, we propose GPTbased method for factuality evaluation and validate its effectiveness through experiments that include human evaluations. Even if caption contains factual information, however, it may still be considered inadequate if it does not sufficiently capture the visual information. To measure the coverage of captions, we construct detailed VQA dataset through collaboration between humans and an AI agent (Achiam et al., 2023). If caption fully encapsulates the information of given image, questions about the image should be answerable accurately using only the caption, without referencing the image itself. Our experiments surprisingly reveal that methods designed to improve the factuality of MLLMs, which have proven effective in tasks like VQA (Huang et al., 2024), may be ineffective for hyper-detailed image captioning tasks that require longer responses. In contrast, CapMAS significantly enhances the factuality of captions and can be applied in plug-and-play manner to any captioning model; notably, this improvement extends to captions generated by the state-ofthe-art closed model, GPT-4V (Achiam et al., 2023). Finally, we highlight an issue"

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at generating highly detailed captions but often produce hallucinations. Our analysis reveals that existing hallucination detection methods struggle with detailed captions. We attribute this to the increasing reliance of MLLMs on their generated text, rather than the input image, as the sequence length grows. To address this issue, we propose a multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and a benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight a limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLM's performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions.

"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at generating highly detailed captions but often produce hallucinations. Our analysis reveals that existing hallucination detection methods struggle with detailed captions. We attribute this to the increasing reliance of MLLMs on their generated text, rather than the input image, as the sequence length grows. To address this issue, we propose a multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and a benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight a limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLM's performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions."
