Text:"DeCRED: Decoder-Centric Regularization for Encoder-Decoder Based Speech Recognition Alexander Polok, Santosh Kesiraju, Karel Beneˇs, Bolaji Yusuf, Lukaˇs Burget, Jan ˇCernocky Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic 5 2 0 2 2 1 ] . e [ 1 8 3 9 8 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r AbstractThis paper presents simple yet effective regularization for the internal language model induced by the decoder in encoder-decoder ASR models, thereby improving robustness and generalization in both inand out-of-domain settings. The proposed method, Decoder-Centric Regularization in EncoderDecoder (DeCRED), adds auxiliary classifiers to the decoder, enabling next token prediction via intermediate logits. Empirically, DeCRED reduces the mean internal LM BPE perplexity by 36.6 % relative to 11 test sets. Furthermore, this translates into actual WER improvements over the baseline in 5 of 7 in-domain and 3 of 4 out-of-domain test sets, reducing macro WER from 6.4 % to 6.3 % and 18.2 % to 16.2 %, respectively. On TEDLIUM3, DeCRED achieves 7.0 % WER, surpassing the baseline and encoder-centric InterCTC regularization by 0.6 % and 0.5 %, respectively. Finally, we compare DeCRED with OWSM v3.1 and Whisper-medium, showing competitive WERs despite training on much less data with fewer parameters. Index Termsspeech recognition, intermediate regularization, out-of-domain generalization I. INTRODUCTION One of the key challenges in automatic speech recognition (ASR) is to enhance the ability of models to generalize to new or unseen domains. Regularization techniques have long been central to improving robustness. Methods such as SpecAug [1], label smoothing [2], [3], multi-task training [4], and architecture-specific regularization [5] are now standard practices in ASR pipelines and are integrated into opensource toolkits [6], [7]. Another prominent strategy is largescale multi-domain training [8], as demonstrated in works like SpeechStew [9], Canary [10], Whisper [11], OWSM [12], and OWLS [13] which agg"

[ 1 6 9 8 8 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r Abstract dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordanceaware positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, novel framework with two-stage training that learns universal grasping policy with an inherent understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage, trajectory imitator is pretrained on large corpus of human hand motions to instill strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, residual module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally inappropriate contact regions, and privileged teacher-student distillation process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably humanlike in posture and functionally appropriate in contact location. As result, AffordDex significantly outperforms stateof-the-art baselines across seen objects, unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories. Source code is available at: https://github.com/Maxwell-Zhao/AffordDex/. Dexterous grasping, as foundational capability for robotic manipulation, has garnered sign"

INTRODUCTION LIMATE change, rapid urbanization, and increasing environmental pressures are reshaping the dynamics of our planet with unprecedented speed [1]. Cities are expanding both in size and density, which makes issues like the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect even worse [2]. At the same time, unpredictable weather patterns and changing ecosystems demand consistent attention and monitoring [3]. These phenomena are spatially and temporally complex, and tackling This work was carried out as part of the CHOISIR project funded by Orleans Metropole, and Region Centre-Val de Loire.

Detecting, monitoring, and predicting these challenges is essential to support sustainable urban planning [5], public health interventions [6], disaster response [7], and climate adaptation [8]. In this context, access to high-resolution environmental data is not only beneficial but crucial for making timely and informed decisions [9]. Land Surface Temperature (LST) is one of the most important geophysical variables for understanding and analyzing diverse environmental challenges. It is defined as the radiative skin temperature of the land surface, representing the complex interactions among incoming solar radiation, land cover, and atmospheric conditions [10]. LST is widely used across various domains, including climate change analysis [11], natural resource management [12], and urban planning [13]. It is regarded as critical component of Earth system data by NASA [14], and is also identified as one of the ten essential climate variables by the Global Climate Observing System [15]. Remote sensing (RS) satellites remain the primary means for monitoring LST at regional to global scales [16]. These satellites retrieve LST through thermal infrared (TIR) sensors that measure the emitted radiation from the Earths surface, which is then processed to estimate LST [17]. However, current RS satellites face trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. Spatial resolution refers to the level of surface detail captured within each pixel of an LST measurement [17], while temporal resolution indicates how frequently LST data are acquired for the same geographic area over time [18]. For instance, Terra MODIS provides daily LST data at moderate 1 km resolution, whereas Landsat 8 offers finer 30 resolution but revisits the same area every 16 days. Figure 1 illustrates this trade-off over the same geographic area. Figure 1.a shows how differences in spatial resolution affect the level of detail. is visible For example, on Landsat 8 LST but not distinguishable on Terra MODIS LST. Figure 1.b highlights temporal resolution differences by showing that 16 daily Terra MODIS LST acquisitions occur between two Landsat 8 observations. Achieving high spatial and temporal resolution simultaneously remains challenging, but crucial to accurately capturing dynamic phenomena. the Loire River, Frances longest, To overcome this trade-off, Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) techniques have emerged as promising solution. These methods generate high spatial resolution satellite observations at finer temporal frequencies by combining data from different RS satellites with varying spatial and temporal characteristics [19]. Typically, one data source offers high spatial but low temporal resolution (HSLT), while the other providestrends, generative adversarial networks (GANs) [30] have demonstrated notable success in image generation, including STF.

Index TermsLarge Language Models, Continual Learning, Finetune, Replay, Activation StateC ONTINUAL learning (CL) of large language models (LLMs) remains challenging for real-world applications. For instance, continual finetuning often degrades general capabilities, particularly over long task sequences. The finetuned model forgets its original world knowledge or basic instruction-following skills [1], [2]. Additionally, the overall performance on sequential downstream tasks often deteriorates due to forgetting of previously learned Yunan Zhang, Shuoran Jiang, Yang Fan, Mengchen Zhao, Xiangping Wu, Qingcai Chen are with the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China. shuoran.chiang@gmail.com, (E-mail: yfan@stu.hit.edu.cn, wxpleduole@gmail.com, qingcai.chen@hit.edu.cn) zhaomengchen@stu.hit.edu.cn, zhangyunan@stu.hit.edu.cn, Yuefeng Li is with Ysstech Info-Tech Co.,Ltd, Shenzhen.

(E-mail: wxpleduole@gmail.com, qingcai.chen@hit.edu.cn) Code and Data Website: https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe Fig. 1: Traditional replay vs. GeRe: unlike traditional replay requiring laborious collection of an increasing set of downstream replay samples, GeRe simply employs fixed set of general replay samples to not only retain general capabilities in continual learning, but also enhance the overall performance of learned downstream tasks. The blue oval is the threshold-based margin loss that imposes consistency constraint on neural activation state under GeRe frameworks. tasks, caused by inter-task conflicts. This phenomenon, also known as catastrophic forgetting, often compels practitioners to seek complex CL solutions. However, the contemporary LLM system, marked by architectural bulkiness and computational heaviness, is imperative to call for simple yet stable approach to effectively mitigate forgetting. In this context, our research aims to review and develop an efficient and general anti-forgetting method of CL adapted to the LLM era. Historically, solutions for CL are primarily categorized into three traditional branches: replay-based, regularizationbased, and architecture-based methods [3]. Considering the massive number of parameters in LLMs and their widely accepted fixed structures, it appears prohibitive and impractical to regularize all parameters or frequently expand the architecture for every new task. Thus current practice in LLMs continual learning regularly prioritizes replay-based methods due to its simplicity. For instance, practitioners commonly mix certain proportion of general task samples JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST during finetuning for downstream tasks [4], [5]. However, the underlying mechanisms and optimal strategies of these replay-based methods tailored for LLMs remain insufficiently explored and analyzed. In this work, we (1) systematically revisit the replay mechanisms targeting LLMs under newly introduced general sample replay (GeRe) framework and, (2) present threshold-based margin (TM) loss for activation state constrained optimization. Specifically, we prepares fixed, permanently reusable set of general replay samples (e.g., the commonly used pretraining texts) and leverages the TM loss to maintain consistent neuron activation states, ultimately resisting various forms of forgetting. The approach is motivated by two ideas: (1) From cognitive perspective, learner obtaining superior general capabilities is more likely to achieve better generalization and robustness in downstream tasks. Leveraging its comprehensive knowledge, such learner can reduce conflicts arising from overfitting to specific tasks, thereby mitigating task forgetting. Consequently, it is worth exploring how to utilize general replay samples to retain general capabilities. (2) In the human brain, critical information is sparsely distributed across few activated neurons [6], [7]. Therefore, in replay-based continual learning (replay learning), the activation states of neurons evoked by replay samples may require deeper attention. By designing an activation state constrained optimization, we seek less rigid but more informative target that enables the replay learning to be more robust and generalizable. Through the paper we have explored and answered 2 pressing questions in real-world LLMs continual learning scenario: Q1: Can we simply select fixed set of replay samples once and for all? To retain general capabilities, contemporary strategies for mixing replay samples in LLM training may be as laborious as feature engineering, requiring carefu"

Decoder-Centric Regularization in Encoder-Decoder (DeCRED) improves ASR robustness and generalization by adding auxiliary classifiers to the decoder, reducing internal language model perplexity and WER.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents a simple yet effective regularization for the internal language model induced by the decoder in encoder-decoder ASR models, thereby improving robustness and generalization in both in- and out-of-domain settings. The proposed method, Decoder-Centric Regularization in Encoder-Decoder (DeCRED), adds auxiliary classifiers to the decoder, enabling next token prediction via intermediate logits. Empirically, DeCRED reduces the mean internal LM BPE perplexity by 36.6% relative to 11 test sets. Furthermore, this translates into actual WER improvements over the baseline in 5 of 7 in-domain and 3 of 4 out-of-domain test sets, reducing macro WER from 6.4% to 6.3% and 18.2% to 16.2%, respectively. On TEDLIUM3, DeCRED achieves 7.0% WER, surpassing the baseline and encoder-centric InterCTC regularization by 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Finally, we compare DeCRED with OWSM v3.1 and Whisper-medium, showing competitive WERs despite training on much less data with fewer parameters.

"Decoder-Centric Regularization in Encoder-Decoder (DeCRED) improves ASR robustness and generalization by adding auxiliary classifiers to the decoder, reducing internal language model perplexity and WER.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents a simple yet effective regularization for the internal language model induced by the decoder in encoder-decoder ASR models, thereby improving robustness and generalization in both in- and out-of-domain settings. The proposed method, Decoder-Centric Regularization in Encoder-Decoder (DeCRED), adds auxiliary classifiers to the decoder, enabling next token prediction via intermediate logits. Empirically, DeCRED reduces the mean internal LM BPE perplexity by 36.6% relative to 11 test sets. Furthermore, this translates into actual WER improvements over the baseline in 5 of 7 in-domain and 3 of 4 out-of-domain test sets, reducing macro WER from 6.4% to 6.3% and 18.2% to 16.2%, respectively. On TEDLIUM3, DeCRED achieves 7.0% WER, surpassing the baseline and encoder-centric InterCTC regularization by 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Finally, we compare DeCRED with OWSM v3.1 and Whisper-medium, showing competitive WERs despite training on much less data with fewer parameters."

AffordDex is a two-stage framework that learns a universal grasping policy with motion priors and object affordances, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in dexterous grasping and human-like postures.  					AI-generated summary 				 A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage, a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects, unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.

WGAST, a weakly-supervised generative network, enhances daily 10 m land surface temperature estimation using spatio-temporal fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity, normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33 ground-based sensors. The code is available at https://github.com/Sofianebouaziz1/WGAST.git.

General Sample Replay (GeRe) framework with threshold-based margin (TM) loss addresses catastrophic forgetting in large language models by maintaining activation state consistency during replay learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting, characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and 2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin (TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning. We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks. Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future.
