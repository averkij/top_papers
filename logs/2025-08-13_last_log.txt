Cornell University. 1 Figure 1: Family trees from the ecosystem dataset. Edges represent different forms of derivative models that are documented as having finetuned, quantized, adapter or merged existing models. Diffusion patterns reveal large broadcasts and numerous generations of derivatives. Graphs without merges are trees, meaning no model has more than one parent (upper left, upper right, and lower left). All graphs are directed and acyclic. levels of availability and paths of diffusion. For example, fully closed-source models may be available through chatbots and API calls, but their weights, source code, training data, and other artifacts remain hidden from view. In contrast, open models make some or all of these materials publicly available for developers and downstream users. The leading provider of open source models is Hugging Face, platform that hosts models, datasets, libraries, and other materials so that communities of developers can easily use AI models, and perhaps even create derivative products that are useful to others. By making AI models readily available, Hugging Face has cultivated an emerging ecosystem of interacting developers of open source models. The present work offers an empirical analysis of the open source ML/AI ecosystem on Hugging Face. We analyze information from the 1.86 million models indexed on Hugging Face, finding rich structural diversity in the diffusion of innovation of open source ML. In 2 particular, accessing information about model family trees,1 we trace the inheritance and mutation of traits between relatives to understand how models develop and evolve. Consider, as one example, the model ibm-granite/granite-3.1, language model developed by the company IBM [19] and available on Hugging Face. That models family tree is depicted in the upper right panel of Figure 1. The tree network depicts the connections among 147 modelsthe base model contributed by IBM and 146 derivative models, many contributed by open source developers. Every black dot represents distinct, publicly available model, and every directed edge represents path from parent model to derivative modelthat is, finetune, quantization, or adapter. The base model produced by IBM spawned eighteen children, of which five are finetunes and the rest are quantizations. Only two of the childrenboth finetunesspawned further generations of children. Moving down another layer, we can see that one of these children produced many more offspring than the other, and from this ancestor there are further branching generations. As of the time that our snapshot data was ingested, this tree spans five generations, but nothing is stopping developers from continuing to tweak, finetune, and produce new members of this family. The two other trees depicted in Figure 1 are families with considerably higher numbers of members. They demonstrate some of the diverse structures and rich topologies that arise when we map these model families. This paper makes the following contributions: 1. We propose studying the evolutionary biology of machine learning models to 1) understand the complexities of the development process, 2) analyze model properties and traits and 3) characterize evolutionary trends over time. To that end, we provide the largest dataset to date of the open-model development ecosystem. Using snapshot of all publicly available models hosted on the platform Hugging Face, our dataset contains variety of features and, crucially, rich information about the topological relations between modelsthat is, whether they finetune, merge, or adapt from one or more other models. 2. We use information from the metadata and model card to track the models genetic traits and measure the genetic similarity between models. We find that models of the same family bear significant resemblance. However, this resemblance departs from typical biological populations because mutations occur at high rate. For instance, we find that pairs of finetuned siblings share more traits than parent/chi"

Analysis of model family trees on Hugging Face reveals patterns in model fine-tuning, including family resemblance, license changes, and model card standardization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Many have observed that the development and deployment of generative machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models follow a distinctive pattern in which pre-trained models are adapted and fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. However, there is limited empirical work that examines the structure of these interactions. This paper analyzes 1.86 million models on Hugging Face, a leading peer production platform for model development. Our study of model family trees -- networks that connect fine-tuned models to their base or parent -- reveals sprawling fine-tuning lineages that vary widely in size and structure. Using an evolutionary biology lens to study ML models, we use model metadata and model cards to measure the genetic similarity and mutation of traits over model families. We find that models tend to exhibit a family resemblance, meaning their genetic markers and traits exhibit more overlap when they belong to the same model family. However, these similarities depart in certain ways from standard models of asexual reproduction, because mutations are fast and directed, such that two `sibling' models tend to exhibit more similarity than parent/child pairs. Further analysis of the directional drifts of these mutations reveals qualitative insights about the open machine learning ecosystem: Licenses counter-intuitively drift from restrictive, commercial licenses towards permissive or copyleft licenses, often in violation of upstream license's terms; models evolve from multi-lingual compatibility towards english-only compatibility; and model cards reduce in length and standardize by turning, more often, to templates and automatically generated text. Overall, this work takes a step toward an empirically grounded understanding of model fine-tuning and suggests that ecological models and methods can yield novel scientific insights.

"Analysis of model family trees on Hugging Face reveals patterns in model fine-tuning, including family resemblance, license changes, and model card standardization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Many have observed that the development and deployment of generative machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models follow a distinctive pattern in which pre-trained models are adapted and fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. However, there is limited empirical work that examines the structure of these interactions. This paper analyzes 1.86 million models on Hugging Face, a leading peer production platform for model development. Our study of model family trees -- networks that connect fine-tuned models to their base or parent -- reveals sprawling fine-tuning lineages that vary widely in size and structure. Using an evolutionary biology lens to study ML models, we use model metadata and model cards to measure the genetic similarity and mutation of traits over model families. We find that models tend to exhibit a family resemblance, meaning their genetic markers and traits exhibit more overlap when they belong to the same model family. However, these similarities depart in certain ways from standard models of asexual reproduction, because mutations are fast and directed, such that two `sibling' models tend to exhibit more similarity than parent/child pairs. Further analysis of the directional drifts of these mutations reveals qualitative insights about the open machine learning ecosystem: Licenses counter-intuitively drift from restrictive, commercial licenses towards permissive or copyleft licenses, often in violation of upstream license's terms; models evolve from multi-lingual compatibility towards english-only compatibility; and model cards reduce in length and standardize by turning, more often, to templates and automatically generated text. Overall, this work takes a step toward an empirically grounded understanding of model fine-tuning and suggests that ecological models and methods can yield novel scientific insights."
