Index TermsImage-to-3D Generation, Diffusion Model, Multi-modality I. INTRODUCTION He automatic generation of high-quality 3D assets from images or texts has wide range of applications, from virtual reality and robotics simulation to industrial design and animation. Recent advances have been witnessed in image [1] and video generation [2] given open-source billion-scale 2D datasets [3]. However, the largest public 3D dataset, Objaverse [4], [5] only includes millions of 3D objects. Therefore, to compensate for the data-hungry of 3D generative models, effectively leveraging heterogeneous 3D datasets through methodological designs is crucial for scalable 3D generative models. Prior arts on 3D generation could be further categorized into three: 1) optimization-based methods [6] using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS); 2) reconstruction-based feedforward models [7][9] which employ transformer to regress Ziang Cao, Zhaoxi Chen, Ziwei Liu are with S-Lab, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. {ziang001, zhaoxi001}@e.ntu.edu.sg, {ziwei.liu }@ntu.edu.sg Liang Pan is with Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory panliang1@pjlab.org.cn (cid:0) Corresponding Author 3D representation given sparse-view images; 3) 3D-native feedforward models [10][14] with 3D diffusion or autoregressive framework. Current 3D generative approaches, despite architectural variations, predominantly adhere to monolithic modality paradigmstypically relying on colored renderings as main training sources. While RGB images provide dense texture priors of 3D assets (e.g., material reflectance, specular highlights), this photometric modality suffers from fundamental limitations: 1) geometric ambiguity in occluded regions, and 2) topological uncertainty due to projective viewpoint. These modality-specific constraints limit the scalability and quality of existing 3D generative models. To address this challenge, we propose TriMM, collaborative multi-modal coding for high-quality feed-forward 3D generation. At the core of our framework is unified latent coding that synergistically integrates photometric and geometric representations from multimodal data (RGB, RGBD, and point clouds), jointly benefiting from the high-frequency texture details encoded by RGB images and metric-accurate topologies encoded by point clouds and depth maps. Our framework employs dedicated modality-specific encoders coupled with shared decoder architecture to map heterogeneous inputs into unified triplane-structured latent representation. To effectively harness the complementary strengths of multimodal inputs, we introduce the reconstruction-based mechanism in the generative model that explicitly guides the model to discern and optimally utilize the distinctive advantages of each modality. To avoid distortion at the large elevation angle and raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding, we adopt auxiliary 2D (e.g., RGB, mask, depth loss) and 3D supervision (SDF loss). This collaborative multi-modal coding further facilitates efficient generative modeling which trains lightweight latent diffusion model conditioned on input images. The well-structured latent representation space established by our multimodal framework enables streamlined generative model training, requiring neither intricate hyperparameter adjustments nor extensive optimization cycles. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks [4], [15] demonstrate that, by leveraging multi-modality information, TriMM achieves competitive performance with recent state-of-the-art methods in generating high-quality 3D assets from images, even when trained on small-scale datasets illustrate in Fig. 1. Beyond exploring the potential of current 3D data, our multimodal encoding architecture inherently supports the tokenization of real-world multi-modal inputs through its extensible design. This framework provides novel and promising pathway to systematically address the challenge of 3D training data scarcity. IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, VOL. X, NO.

Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference reward-based GRPO method, enhances text-to-image generation by mitigating reward hacking and improving stability, while UniGenBench provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2I models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens when minimal score differences between images are amplified after normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM, and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences, providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally, existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20 subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27 sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20 subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27 sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO."

USO, a unified model, achieves state-of-the-art performance in both style similarity and subject consistency by disentangling and re-composing content and style through a disentangled learning scheme and style reward-learning paradigm.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity, whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.

ROSE, a video inpainting framework using diffusion transformers, effectively removes objects and their side effects like shadows and reflections by leveraging synthetic data and differential masks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision. This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes, objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios.

TriMM, a feed-forward 3D-native generative model, integrates multi-modal data (RGB, RGBD, point clouds) to enhance 3D asset generation quality and robustness.  					AI-generated summary 				 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds). Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

"TriMM, a feed-forward 3D-native generative model, integrates multi-modal data (RGB, RGBD, point clouds) to enhance 3D asset generation quality and robustness.  					AI-generated summary 				 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds). Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation."
