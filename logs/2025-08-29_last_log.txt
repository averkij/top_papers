Index TermsImage-to-3D Generation, Diffusion Model, Multi-modality I. INTRODUCTION He automatic generation of high-quality 3D assets from images or texts has wide range of applications, from virtual reality and robotics simulation to industrial design and animation. Recent advances have been witnessed in image [1] and video generation [2] given open-source billion-scale 2D datasets [3]. However, the largest public 3D dataset, Objaverse [4], [5] only includes millions of 3D objects. Therefore, to compensate for the data-hungry of 3D generative models, effectively leveraging heterogeneous 3D datasets through methodological designs is crucial for scalable 3D generative models. Prior arts on 3D generation could be further categorized into three: 1) optimization-based methods [6] using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS); 2) reconstruction-based feedforward models [7][9] which employ transformer to regress Ziang Cao, Zhaoxi Chen, Ziwei Liu are with S-Lab, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. {ziang001, zhaoxi001}@e.ntu.edu.sg, {ziwei.liu }@ntu.edu.sg Liang Pan is with Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory panliang1@pjlab.org.cn (cid:0) Corresponding Author 3D representation given sparse-view images; 3) 3D-native feedforward models [10][14] with 3D diffusion or autoregressive framework. Current 3D generative approaches, despite architectural variations, predominantly adhere to monolithic modality paradigmstypically relying on colored renderings as main training sources. While RGB images provide dense texture priors of 3D assets (e.g., material reflectance, specular highlights), this photometric modality suffers from fundamental limitations: 1) geometric ambiguity in occluded regions, and 2) topological uncertainty due to projective viewpoint. These modality-specific constraints limit the scalability and quality of existing 3D generative models. To address this challenge, we propose TriMM, collaborative multi-modal coding for high-quality feed-forward 3D generation. At the core of our framework is unified latent coding that synergistically integrates photometric and geometric representations from multimodal data (RGB, RGBD, and point clouds), jointly benefiting from the high-frequency texture details encoded by RGB images and metric-accurate topologies encoded by point clouds and depth maps. Our framework employs dedicated modality-specific encoders coupled with shared decoder architecture to map heterogeneous inputs into unified triplane-structured latent representation. To effectively harness the complementary strengths of multimodal inputs, we introduce the reconstruction-based mechanism in the generative model that explicitly guides the model to discern and optimally utilize the distinctive advantages of each modality. To avoid distortion at the large elevation angle and raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding, we adopt auxiliary 2D (e.g., RGB, mask, depth loss) and 3D supervision (SDF loss). This collaborative multi-modal coding further facilitates efficient generative modeling which trains lightweight latent diffusion model conditioned on input images. The well-structured latent representation space established by our multimodal framework enables streamlined generative model training, requiring neither intricate hyperparameter adjustments nor extensive optimization cycles. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks [4], [15] demonstrate that, by leveraging multi-modality information, TriMM achieves competitive performance with recent state-of-the-art methods in generating high-quality 3D assets from images, even when trained on small-scale datasets illustrate in Fig. 1. Beyond exploring the potential of current 3D data, our multimodal encoding architecture inherently supports the tokenization of real-world multi-modal inputs through its extensible design. This framework provides novel and promising pathway to systematically address the challenge of 3D training data scarcity. IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, VOL. X, NO. X, MMMMMMM YYYY 2 Fig. 1. By leveraging a) Collaborative Multi-Modal Coding encoded from photometric (RGB, RGBD) and geometric (RGBD, Point Clouds) information, b) TriMM can create high-quality textured meshes within 4 seconds from single image.

AI-generated summary 				 The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node, sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

"AWorld, an open-source system for large-scale agent-environment interaction, accelerates experience collection and enhances reinforcement learning, leading to significant improvements in agentic AI performance on complex benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node, sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement."

Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA) enhances large language models' performance on specific tasks while maintaining general instruction-following ability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.   We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused applications.
