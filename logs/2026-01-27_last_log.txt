Leading models such as Sora [14], Veo [20], Kling [21], Wan [7], and Gen3 [26] have demonstrated implications that extend far beyond mere visual fidelity. These models exhibit emergent physical coherence. For example, they learned to respect gravity, understand collision dynamics, and recognize object permanence without explicit physical instruction. As result, video generation models are increasingly discussed not merely as content creation tools, but as potential world models [14], [20], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32] that appear to simulate the physical evolution of the environment. To critically assess this potential, it is necessary to revisit the theoretical origins of the concept of the world model. The evolution of world models has spanned multiple epochsmoving from cognitive science and control theory to the modern era of deep learning. The term has its roots in cognitive science, specifically in the theory of mental models [33], [34], [35]. These foundational works posited that intelligent organisms maintain small-scale model of external reality to anticipate events, reason about Luozhou Wang and Zhifei Chen contributed equally to this work.

Subsequently, in the field of control theory [36], [37], this internal simulation process was explicitly formalized through mathematical rules. This transition defined the concept of an internal state by manually selecting key variables to represent the environment. In this framework, transition equationderived from physical laws or established rulesis constructed to evolve the state during inference. In contrast an observation equation is used to map these states back to sensory inputs. The concept has since evolved into the modern era of deep learning, with Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57] serving as one of the most representative methodologies. In these settings, the world model is parameterized, data-driven system inextricably coupled with policy agent in closedloop interaction. By learning from data, the model captures environmental laws, allowing the agent to dream or practice in latent imagination space before execution in the real world. All these discussions regarding world models can be synthesized into three core elements: observation, state, and dynamics. Observation refers to the perceptible modalities or raw data from the environment. The state, while lacking singular universal definition, generally refers to set of variables that provides sufficient representation of the world by removing redundancies irrelevant to the current task. Dynamics is responsible for state transitions governed by underlying causal relationships. Taking MBRL as primary example, these approaches typically rely on an explicit State-Space Model (SSM). By constructing such explicit state representations, these models can achieve long-range reasoning with constant computational overhead. Furthermore, this structure facilitates 6 2 0 2 2 2 ] . [ 1 7 6 0 7 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r explicit causal decoupling, which effectively isolates internal state transitions from the influence of external control inputs. However, video models operate very differently from the world models mentioned above. First, the training and inference of video models do not involve reinforcement learning or policy models. Instead, they work in an openloop manner, learning by passively observing large amounts of data [29], [30], [31], [32], [39]. Most video models [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25] use the transformer architecture, which models observation sequences directly. Because of its high parallelism and efficiency, this architecture scales easily with more data and computing power, leading to very strong emergent capabilities. However, these transformer-based models lack explicit state modeling. Because they do not construct hidden state to represent the world, they must keep very large context window during long-term reasoning. This creates significant memory and computati"

Video generation models are categorized based on state construction and dynamics modeling approaches, with emphasis on transitioning evaluation metrics from visual quality to functional capabilities like physical persistence and causal reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated emergent physical coherence, positioning them as potential world models. However, a gap remains between contemporary "stateless" video architectures and classic state-centric world model theories. This work bridges this gap by proposing a novel taxonomy centered on two pillars: State Construction and Dynamics Modeling. We categorize state construction into implicit paradigms (context management) and explicit paradigms (latent compression), while dynamics modeling is analyzed through knowledge integration and architectural reformulation. Furthermore, we advocate for a transition in evaluation from visual fidelity to functional benchmarks, testing physical persistence and causal reasoning. We conclude by identifying two critical frontiers: enhancing persistence via data-driven memory and compressed fidelity, and advancing causality through latent factor decoupling and reasoning-prior integration. By addressing these challenges, the field can evolve from generating visually plausible videos to building robust, general-purpose world simulators.

We categorize state construction into implicit paradigms (context management) and explicit paradigms (latent compression), while dynamics modeling is analyzed through knowledge integration and architectural reformulation.

"Video generation models are categorized based on state construction and dynamics modeling approaches, with emphasis on transitioning evaluation metrics from visual quality to functional capabilities like physical persistence and causal reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated emergent physical coherence, positioning them as potential world models. However, a gap remains between contemporary "stateless" video architectures and classic state-centric world model theories. This work bridges this gap by proposing a novel taxonomy centered on two pillars: State Construction and Dynamics Modeling. We categorize state construction into implicit paradigms (context management) and explicit paradigms (latent compression), while dynamics modeling is analyzed through knowledge integration and architectural reformulation. Furthermore, we advocate for a transition in evaluation from visual fidelity to functional benchmarks, testing physical persistence and causal reasoning. We conclude by identifying two critical frontiers: enhancing persistence via data-driven memory and compressed fidelity, and advancing causality through latent factor decoupling and reasoning-prior integration.

**Justification:**

1. **REASONING**: The paper explicitly discusses "causal reasoning" as a functional capability and mentions "advancing causality through latent factor decoupling and reasoning-prior integration" as a critical frontier. This directly relates to enhancing logical reasoning capabilities.

2. **SURVEY**: The paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy and categorization of video generation models, organizing them by state construction and dynamics modeling approaches. It reviews and synthesizes different paradigms and approaches in the field, which is characteristic of a survey paper.
