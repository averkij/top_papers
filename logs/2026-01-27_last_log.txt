Corresponding author: Xuanhe Zhou (zhouxuanhe@sjtu.edu.cn). Fig. 1. Application-Ready DATA PREPARATION Three core tasks (i.e., Data Cleaning, Integration, and Enrichment) address key sources of data inefficiency: quality issues, integration barriers, and semantic gaps. sharing [5], [6], data preparation remains critical bottleneck in real scenarios. For instance, an estimated 20%30% of enterprise revenue is lost due to data inefficiencies [7]. As illustrated in Figure 1, real-world data inefficiencies primarily arise from three sources: (1) Consistency & Quality Issues (e.g., non-standard formats, noise, and incompleteness); (2) Isolation & Integration Barriers (e.g., disparate systems, entity ambiguity, and schema conflicts); and (3) Semantic & Context Limitations (e.g., missing metadata and unlabeled data). To these challenges, data preparation [8], [9] involves three main tasks: Data Cleaning, Data Integration, and Data Enrichment, which transform raw inputs into unified, reliable, and enriched datasets. As the volume and heterogeneity of data continue to surge (e.g., global data volume is forecast to triple from 2025 to 2029 [10]), the imperative for effective data preparation has never been greater. However, traditional data preparation methods rely heavily on static rules [11], [12], manual interventions, or narrowly scoped models [13], [14], motivating the need for more intelligent, adaptive solutions. A. Limitations of Traditional DATA PREPARATION As discussed above, traditional preparation techniques, ranging from heuristic rule-based systems [15], [16], [12] IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING, VOL. 0, NO. 0, JANUARY 2025 2 Fig. 2. Overview of Application-Ready DATA PREPARATION through LLM-Enhanced Methods. to domain-specific machine-learning models [17], [18], [13], [14], face several fundamental limitations. (Limitation ❶) High Manual Effort and Expertise Dependence. Traditional data preparation methods largely depend on fixed rules and domain-specific configurations, such as regular expressions and validation constraints [19], [20]. This reliance demands substantial manual effort and specialized expert knowledge, introducing significant development and maintenance barriers. For instance, data standardization typically requires complex, handcrafted scripts (e.g., userdefined functions) or manual constraints (e.g., date formatting rules) [11], [21]. Similarly, data error processing pipelines often rely on fixed detect-then-correct workflows defined by manually crafted rules, which are not only labor-intensive to maintain but also prone to introducing new errors (e.g., incorrectly repaired values) during correction [22]. (Limitation ❷) Limited Semantic Awareness in Preparation Enforcement. Conventional rule-based approaches predominantly rely on statistical patterns (e.g., computing missing value percentages) or syntactic matching, which fundamentally limit their ability to accurately identify complex inconsistencies that require semantic reasoning. For example, in data integration, traditional similarity-based matching techniques struggle to resolve semantic ambigu"

While sequence of omni MLLMs has emerged, most existing systems still rely on additional expert components to achieve multimodal generation, limiting the simplicity of unified training and inference. Autoregressive (AR) modeling, with single token stream, single next-token objective, and single decoder, is an elegant and scalable foundation in the text domain. Motivated by this, we present AR-Omni, unified any-to-any model in the autoregressive paradigm without any expert decoders. AR-Omni supports autoregressive text and image generation, as well as streaming speech generation, all under single Transformer decoder. We further address three practical issues in unified AR modeling: modality imbalance via task-aware loss reweighting, visual fidelity via lightweight token-level perceptual alignment loss for image tokens, and stabilitycreativity trade-offs via finite-state decoding mechanism. Empirically, AR-Omni achieves strong quality across three modalities while remaining real-time, achieving 0.88 real-time factor for speech generation.

Existing Text-to-Image (T2I) models often produce outputs that are visually plausible yet scientifically incorrect, resulting in persistent visuallogic divergence that limits their value for downstream reasoning. Motivated by recent advances in next-generation T2I models, we conduct systematic study of scientific image synthesis across generation paradigms, evaluation, and downstream use. We analyze both direct pixel-based generation and programmatic synthesis, and propose ImgCoder, logic-driven framework that follows an explicit understand plan code workflow to improve structural precision. To rigorously assess scientific correctness, we introduce SciGenBench, which evaluates generated images based on information utility and logical validity. Our evaluation reveals systematic failure modes in pixel-based models and highlights fundamental expressivenessprecision trade-off. Finally, we show that fine-tuning Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on rigorously verified synthetic scientific images yields consistent reasoning gains, with potential scaling trends analogous to the text domain, validating high-fidelity scientific synthesis as viable path to unlocking massive multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Text:"IVRA: Improving Visual-Token Relations for Robot Action Policy with Training-Free Hint-Based Guidance Jongwoo Park1, Kanchana Ranasinghe1, Jinhyeok Jang2, Cristina Mata1, Yoo Sung Jang1, Michael Ryoo1 1Stony Brook University 2ETRI jongwopark@cs.stonybrook.edu 6 2 0 J 2 2 ] . [ 1 7 0 2 6 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r Abstract Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models flatten image patches into 1D token sequence, weakening the 2D spatial cues needed for precise manipulation. We introduce IVRA, lightweight, training-free method that improves spatial understanding by exploiting affinity hints already available in the models built-in vision encoder, without requiring any external encoder or retraining. IVRA selectively injects layer in which these affinity signals into language-model instance-level features reside. This inference-time intervention realigns visual-token interactions and better preserves geometric structure while keeping all model parameters fixed. We demonstrate the generality of IVRA by applying it to diverse VLA architectures (LLaRA, OpenVLA, and FLOWER) across simulated benchmarks spanning both 2D and 3D manipulation (VIMA and LIBERO) and on various real-robot tasks. On 2D VIMA, IVRA improves average success by +4.2% over the baseline LLaRA in low-data regime. On 3D LIBERO, it yields consistent gains over the OpenVLA and FLOWER baselines, including improvements when baseline accuracy is near saturation (96.3% 97.1%). All code and models will be released publicly. Visualizations are available at: jongwoopark7978.github.io/IVRA I. INTRODUCTION Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have rapidly emerged as promising approach for generating robot actions from images and natural-language instructions. Recent systems such as LLaRA [1], OpenVLA [2], FLOWER [3], and LLARVA [4] pair large-scale pretrained vision encoders (e.g., CLIP or DINO [5], [6]) with language models by flattening the 2D patch grid and appending the resulting visual tokens to the text sequence in single Tran"

Unlike traditional pipelined approaches that rely on audio chunking, VIBEVOICE-ASR supports single-pass processing for up to 60 minutes of audio. It unifies Automatic Speech Recognition, Speaker Diarization, and Timestamping into single end-to-end generation task. In addition, VIBEVOICE-ASR supports over 50 languages, requires no explicit language setting, and natively handles code-switching within and across utterances. Furthermore, we introduce prompt-based context injection mechanism that allows users to supply customized conetxt, significantly improving accuracy on domain-specific terminology and polyphonic character disambiguation. Code: github.com/microsoft/VibeVoice Hugging Face: microsoft/VibeVoice Demo: aka.ms/VibeVoice-ASR Figure 1: VIBEVOICE-ASR sets new state-of-the-art for long-form speech understanding, consistently outperforming strong closed-source multimodal models (Gemini-2.5/3-Pro) across five public benchmarks. The results demonstrate superior accuracy in both speaker attribution (DER) and time-aligned transcription (tcpWER), particularly in complex multi-speaker environments. Recent years have witnessed paradigm shift in speech processing, driven by the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with acoustic encoders [CXZ+23]"

A novel end-to-end agentic framework translates dialogue into cinematic videos through specialized agents that generate and orchestrate video content while maintaining narrative coherence.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in video generation have produced models capable of synthesizing stunning visual content from simple text prompts. However, these models struggle to generate long-form, coherent narratives from high-level concepts like dialogue, revealing a ``semantic gap'' between a creative idea and its cinematic execution. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel, end-to-end agentic framework for dialogue-to-cinematic-video generation. Central to our framework is ScripterAgent, a model trained to translate coarse dialogue into a fine-grained, executable cinematic script. To enable this, we construct ScriptBench, a new large-scale benchmark with rich multimodal context, annotated via an expert-guided pipeline. The generated script then guides DirectorAgent, which orchestrates state-of-the-art video models using a cross-scene continuous generation strategy to ensure long-horizon coherence. Our comprehensive evaluation, featuring an AI-powered CriticAgent and a new Visual-Script Alignment (VSA) metric, shows our framework significantly improves script faithfulness and temporal fidelity across all tested video models. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a crucial trade-off in current SOTA models between visual spectacle and strict script adherence, providing valuable insights for the future of automated filmmaking.

Elastic Attention enables dynamic adjustment of attention sparsity during inference by integrating a lightweight Attention Router into pretrained models, achieving efficient long-context processing.  					AI-generated summary 				 The quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms poses a significant scalability bottleneck for large language models (LLMs) in long-context scenarios. While hybrid attention strategies that combine sparse and full attention within a single model offer a viable solution, they typically employ static computation ratios (i.e., fixed proportions of sparse versus full attention) and fail to adapt to the varying sparsity sensitivities of downstream tasks during inference. To address this issue, we propose Elastic Attention, which allows the model to dynamically adjust its overall sparsity based on the input. This is achieved by integrating a lightweight Attention Router into the existing pretrained model, which dynamically assigns each attention head to different computation modes. Within only 12 hours of training on 8xA800 GPUs, our method enables models to achieve both strong performance and efficient inference. Experiments across three long-context benchmarks on widely-used LLMs demonstrate the superiority of our method.

LLM-enhanced data preparation methods are transforming data-centric workflows from rule-based pipelines to prompt-driven, context-aware approaches, organized into data cleaning, integration, and enrichment tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Data preparation aims to denoise raw datasets, uncover cross-dataset relationships, and extract valuable insights from them, which is essential for a wide range of data-centric applications. Driven by (i) rising demands for application-ready data (e.g., for analytics, visualization, decision-making), (ii) increasingly powerful LLM techniques, and (iii) the emergence of infrastructures that facilitate flexible agent construction (e.g., using Databricks Unity Catalog), LLM-enhanced methods are rapidly becoming a transformative and potentially dominant paradigm for data preparation.   By investigating hundreds of recent literature works, this paper presents a systematic review of this evolving landscape, focusing on the use of LLM techniques to prepare data for diverse downstream tasks. First, we characterize the fundamental paradigm shift, from rule-based, model-specific pipelines to prompt-driven, context-aware, and agentic preparation workflows. Next, we introduce a task-centric taxonomy that organizes the field into three major tasks: data cleaning (e.g., standardization, error processing, imputation), data integration (e.g., entity matching, schema matching), and data enrichment (e.g., data annotation, profiling). For each task, we survey representative techniques, and highlight their respective strengths (e.g., improved generalization, semantic understanding) and limitations (e.g., the prohibitive cost of scaling LLMs, persistent hallucinations even in advanced agents, the mismatch between advanced methods and weak evaluation). Moreover, we analyze commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics (the empirical part). Finally, we discuss open research challenges and outline a forward-looking roadmap that emphasizes scalable LLM-data systems, principled designs for reliable agentic workflows, and robust evaluation protocols.

AR-Omni is a unified autoregressive model that supports multimodal input and output generation through a single Transformer decoder, addressing modality balance, visual fidelity, and stability-creativity trade-offs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Real-world perception and interaction are inherently multimodal, encompassing not only language but also vision and speech, which motivates the development of "Omni" MLLMs that support both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs. While a sequence of omni MLLMs has emerged, most existing systems still rely on additional expert components to achieve multimodal generation, limiting the simplicity of unified training and inference. Autoregressive (AR) modeling, with a single token stream, a single next-token objective, and a single decoder, is an elegant and scalable foundation in the text domain. Motivated by this, we present AR-Omni, a unified any-to-any model in the autoregressive paradigm without any expert decoders. AR-Omni supports autoregressive text and image generation, as well as streaming speech generation, all under a single Transformer decoder. We further address three practical issues in unified AR modeling: modality imbalance via task-aware loss reweighting, visual fidelity via a lightweight token-level perceptual alignment loss for image tokens, and stability-creativity trade-offs via a finite-state decoding mechanism. Empirically, AR-Omni achieves strong quality across three modalities while remaining real-time, achieving a 0.88 real-time factor for speech generation.

Imbalanced expert routing in Mixture-of-Experts models leads to computational inefficiencies in expert parallelism, which are addressed by a dynamic rerouting algorithm that balances workload and reduces memory usage.  					AI-generated summary 				 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are typically pre-trained with explicit load-balancing constraints to ensure statistically balanced expert routing. Despite this, we observe that even well-trained MoE models exhibit significantly imbalanced routing. This behavior is arguably natural-and even desirable - as imbalanced routing allows models to concentrate domain-specific knowledge within a subset of experts. Expert parallelism (EP) is designed to scale MoE models by distributing experts across multiple devices, but with a less-discussed assumption of balanced routing. Under extreme imbalance, EP can funnel a disproportionate number of tokens to a small number of experts, leading to compute- and memory-bound failures on overloaded devices during post-training or inference, where explicit load balancing is often inapplicable. We propose Least-Loaded Expert Parallelism (LLEP), a novel EP algorithm that dynamically reroutes excess tokens and associated expert parameters from overloaded devices to underutilized ones. This ensures that all devices complete their workloads within the minimum collective latency while respecting memory constraints. Across different model scales, LLEP achieves up to 5x speedup and 4x reduction in peak memory usage compared to standard EP. This enables faster and higher-throughput post-training and inference, with ~1.9x faster for gpt-oss-120b. We support our method with extensive theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations, including ablation studies. These results illuminate key trade-offs and enable a principled framework for hardware-specific hyper-parameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.

This behavior is arguably natural-and even desirable - as imbalanced routing allows models to concentrate domain-specific knowledge within a subset of experts. Expert parallelism (EP) is designed to scale MoE models by distributing experts across multiple devices, but with a less-discussed assumption of balanced routing. Under extreme imbalance, EP can funnel a disproportionate number of tokens to a small number of experts, leading to compute- and memory-bound failures on overloaded devices during post-training or inference, where explicit load balancing is often inapplicable. We propose Least-Loaded Expert Parallelism (LLEP), a novel EP algorithm that dynamically reroutes excess tokens and associated expert parameters from overloaded devices to underutilized ones. This ensures that all devices complete their workloads within the minimum collective latency while respecting memory constraints. Across different model scales, LLEP achieves up to 5x speedup and 4x reduction in peak memory usage compared to standard EP. This enables faster and higher-throughput post-training and inference, with ~1.9x faster for gpt-oss-120b. We support our method with extensive theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations, including ablation studies.

Scientific image synthesis using logic-driven frameworks like ImgCoder improves multimodal reasoning by addressing visual-logic divergence through structured generation and evaluation benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 While synthetic data has proven effective for improving scientific reasoning in the text domain, multimodal reasoning remains constrained by the difficulty of synthesizing scientifically rigorous images. Existing Text-to-Image (T2I) models often produce outputs that are visually plausible yet scientifically incorrect, resulting in a persistent visual-logic divergence that limits their value for downstream reasoning. Motivated by recent advances in next-generation T2I models, we conduct a systematic study of scientific image synthesis across generation paradigms, evaluation, and downstream use. We analyze both direct pixel-based generation and programmatic synthesis, and propose ImgCoder, a logic-driven framework that follows an explicit "understand - plan - code" workflow to improve structural precision. To rigorously assess scientific correctness, we introduce SciGenBench, which evaluates generated images based on information utility and logical validity. Our evaluation reveals systematic failure modes in pixel-based models and highlights a fundamental expressiveness-precision trade-off. Finally, we show that fine-tuning Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on rigorously verified synthetic scientific images yields consistent reasoning gains, with potential scaling trends analogous to the text domain, validating high-fidelity scientific synthesis as a viable path to unlocking massive multimodal reasoning capabilities.

An agentic framework for automatic academic rebuttal generation that decomposes reviews, retrieves evidence, plans rebuttal strategies, and generates persuasive responses with human-level performance using an 8B model.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite the growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific research workflows, automated support for academic rebuttal, a crucial step in academic communication and peer review, remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on off-the-shelf LLMs or simple pipelines, which struggle with long-context understanding and often fail to produce targeted and persuasive responses. In this paper, we propose DRPG, an agentic framework for automatic academic rebuttal generation that operates through four steps: Decompose reviews into atomic concerns, Retrieve relevant evidence from the paper, Plan rebuttal strategies, and Generate responses accordingly. Notably, the Planner in DRPG reaches over 98% accuracy in identifying the most feasible rebuttal direction. Experiments on data from top-tier conferences demonstrate that DRPG significantly outperforms existing rebuttal pipelines and achieves performance beyond the average human level using only an 8B model. Our analysis further demonstrates the effectiveness of the planner design and its value in providing multi-perspective and explainable suggestions. We also showed that DRPG works well in a more complex multi-round setting. These results highlight the effectiveness of DRPG and its potential to provide high-quality rebuttal content and support the scaling of academic discussions.

AI-generated summary 				 Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models flatten image patches into a 1D token sequence, weakening the 2D spatial cues needed for precise manipulation. We introduce IVRA, a lightweight, training-free method that improves spatial understanding by exploiting affinity hints already available in the model's built-in vision encoder, without requiring any external encoder or retraining. IVRA selectively injects these affinity signals into a language-model layer in which instance-level features reside. This inference-time intervention realigns visual-token interactions and better preserves geometric structure while keeping all model parameters fixed. We demonstrate the generality of IVRA by applying it to diverse VLA architectures (LLaRA, OpenVLA, and FLOWER) across simulated benchmarks spanning both 2D and 3D manipulation (VIMA and LIBERO) and on various real-robot tasks. On 2D VIMA, IVRA improves average success by +4.2% over the baseline LLaRA in a low-data regime. On 3D LIBERO, it yields consistent gains over the OpenVLA and FLOWER baselines, including improvements when baseline accuracy is near saturation (96.3% to 97.1%). All code and models will be released publicly. Visualizations are available at: jongwoopark7978.github.io/IVRA

IVRA сохраняет геометрическую структуру изображения, которая обычно теряется при преобразовании 2D патчей в одномерную последовательность токенов. Подход демонстрирует универсальность, показывая улучшения на различных VLA архитектурах и задачах манипуляции как в симуляции, так и на реальных роботах.",

VibeVoice-ASR is a unified end-to-end speech understanding framework that processes long-form audio in a single pass while supporting multilingual, code-switching, and domain-specific context injection.  					AI-generated summary 				 This report presents VibeVoice-ASR, a general-purpose speech understanding framework built upon VibeVoice, designed to address the persistent challenges of context fragmentation and multi-speaker complexity in long-form audio (e.g., meetings, podcasts) that remain despite recent advancements in short-form speech recognition. Unlike traditional pipelined approaches that rely on audio chunking, VibeVoice-ASRsupports single-pass processing for up to 60 minutes of audio. It unifies Automatic Speech Recognition, Speaker Diarization, and Timestamping into a single end-to-end generation task. In addition, VibeVoice-ASR supports over 50 languages, requires no explicit language setting, and natively handles code-switching within and across utterances. Furthermore, we introduce a prompt-based context injection mechanism that allows users to supply customized conetxt, significantly improving accuracy on domain-specific terminology and polyphonic character disambiguation.
