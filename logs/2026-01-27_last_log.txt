INTRODUCTION interest, meaningful Child-adult spoken interactions play central role in developmental research, clinical assessment, and behavioral analysis. These conversational exchanges provide critical information about childrens expressive language abilities, social communication patterns, and turn-taking behavior [1]. Unlike monologic speech settings where only single speakers content may be of interpretation of childadult interactions fundamentally depends on knowing what both participants say and how they respond to one another. Extracting reliable speaker-attributed transcripts from these interactions enables the computation of conversational metrics (e.g., words per minute, utterance duration, conversational latency) that serve as quantitative indicators of spoken language development and severity of social communication symptoms [2], [3]. However, manual transcription and speaker labeling are extremely labor-intensive and difficult to scale for large cohorts.

Despite substantial advancements in end-to-end ASR [4] and speaker diarization [5] systems, automated transcription of child-adult dyadic interactions remains challenging. Child speech differs significantly from adult speech in terms of pitch, formant structure, articulation, and linguistic complexity [6] [8]. These challenges are further exacerbated in naturalistic settings where recordings often contain significant ambient noise and speakers present widely varying expressive abilities [9]. While such acoustic and linguistic heterogeneity poses fundamental modeling challenges for ASR systems, recent studies show that Whisper models can achieve strong performance when appropriately fine-tuned, likely due to their large-scale and diverse pretraining data [10], [11]. Crucially, many downstream behavioral analyses require accurate utterance-level timestamps, in addition to transcripts and speaker labels [12]. Prior work has approached speakerand, in some cases, timestamp-attributed transcription using cascaded pipelines, typically performing speaker diarization followed by ASR, or applying ASR first and attributing speakers afterward [13][15]. Diarization-first pipelines can produce reasonable speaker boundaries, but segmentation errors naturally propagate to the ASR stage. Conversely, ASR-first pipelines can degrade the performance of forced alignment and speaker attribution through transcription errors. These cascaded designs require substantial domain tuning and often produce suboptimal timestamp or speaker-role accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose unified endto-end framework for joint ASR and speaker-role diarization tailored to child-adult interactions. Our approach extends the Whisper encoder-decoder architecture with two key components: (1) serialized output training scheme that generates speaker tags and start/end timestamp tokens within single output sequence, and (2) lightweight diarization head attached to the final encoder layer that produces frame-level speaker activity labels. Timestamp supervision, speaker-role supervision, and lexical prediction are learned jointly, enabling the encoder to develop speaker-discriminative and temporally aligned representations. To ensure structurally valid outputs, we introduce state-machine-based forced decoding mechanism that enforces the correct ordering of speaker and timestamp tokens. Additionally, we incorporate diarization-guided silence suppression during decoding to reduce timestamp drift and improve boundary precision. Our work makes the following contributions: Unified Whisper ASR and diarization modeling: single JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 Whisper-based system that predicts transcripts, speaker roles, and utterance-level timestamps without external segmentation or forced alignment.

A unified end-to-end framework extends the Whisper architecture to jointly model automatic speech recognition and speaker diarization for child-adult interactions, improving transcription accuracy and scalability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Accurate transcription and speaker diarization of child-adult spoken interactions are crucial for developmental and clinical research. However, manual annotation is time-consuming and challenging to scale. Existing automated systems typically rely on cascaded speaker diarization and speech recognition pipelines, which can lead to error propagation. This paper presents a unified end-to-end framework that extends the Whisper encoder-decoder architecture to jointly model ASR and child-adult speaker role diarization. The proposed approach integrates: (i) a serialized output training scheme that emits speaker tags and start/end timestamps, (ii) a lightweight frame-level diarization head that enhances speaker-discriminative encoder representations, (iii) diarization-guided silence suppression for improved temporal precision, and (iv) a state-machine-based forced decoding procedure that guarantees structurally valid outputs. Comprehensive evaluations on two datasets demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements over two cascaded baselines, achieving lower multi-talker word error rates and demonstrating competitive diarization accuracy across both Whisper-small and Whisper-large models. These findings highlight the effectiveness and practical utility of the proposed joint modeling framework for generating reliable, speaker-attributed transcripts of child-adult interactions at scale. The code and model weights are publicly available

Code-switching presents complex challenges in multilingual communication that current language models struggle to address effectively.  					AI-generated summary 				 Code-switching is a widespread practice among the world's multilingual majority, yet few benchmarks accurately reflect its complexity in everyday communication. We present PingPong, a benchmark for natural multi-party code-switching dialogues covering five language-combination variations, some of which are trilingual. Our dataset consists of human-authored conversations among 2 to 4 participants covering authentic, multi-threaded structures where replies frequently reference much earlier points in the dialogue. We demonstrate that our data is significantly more natural and structurally diverse than machine-generated alternatives, offering greater variation in message length, speaker dominance, and reply distance. Based on these dialogues, we define three downstream tasks: Question Answering, Dialogue Summarization, and Topic Classification. Evaluations of several state-of-the-art language models on PingPong reveal that performance remains limited on code-switched inputs, underscoring the urgent need for more robust NLP systems capable of addressing the intricacies of real-world multilingual discourse.

Датасет содержит аутентичные беседы между 2-4 участниками на пяти языковых комбинациях, включая трёхязычные варианты, с более сложной структурой, чем машинно-генерированные альтернативы. На основе этих диалогов определены три задачи: ответы на вопросы, суммаризация диалогов и классификация тем. Эксперименты показали, что современные LLM плохо справляются с code-switching, что подчёркивает необходимость разработки более устойчивых NLP систем для работы с реальным многоязычным общением.",
