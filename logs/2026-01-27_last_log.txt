However, structural and semantic discrepancies between unstructured text and structured tables make embedding alignment particularly challenging. Recent methods such as QGpT attempt to enrich table semantics by generating synthetic queries, yet they still rely on coarse partial-table sampling and simple fusion strategies, which limit semantic diversity and hinder effective querytable alignment. We propose STAR (Semantic Table Representation), lightweight framework that improves semantic table representation through semantic clustering and weighted fusion. STAR first applies headeraware K-means clustering to group semantically similar rows and selects representative centroid instances to construct diverse partial table. It then generates cluster-specific synthetic queries to comprehensively cover the tables semantic space. Finally, STAR employs weighted fusion strategies to integrate table and query embeddings, enabling fine-grained semantic alignment. This design enables STAR to capture complementary information from structured and textual sources, improving the expressiveness of table representations. Experiments "

However, existing work has mainly focused on efficiency and performance, while the security implications of visual token compression remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first reveal that visual token compression substantially degrades the robustness of LVLMs: models that are robust under uncompressed inference become highly vulnerable once compression is enabled. These vulnerabilities are state-specific; failure modes emerge only in the compressed setting and completely disappear when compression is disabled, making them particularly hidden and difficult to diagnose. By analyzing the key stages of the compression process, we identify instability in token importance ranking as the primary cause of this robustness degradation. Small and imperceptible perturbations can significantly alter token rankings, leading the compression mechanism to mistakenly discard task-critical information and ultimately causing model failure. Motivated by this observation, we propose Compression-Aware Attack (CAA) to systematically study and exploit this vulnerability. CAA directly targets the token selection mechanism and induces failures exclusively under compressed inference. We further extend this approach to more realistic black-box settings and introduce "

Text:"Plug-and-Play Benchmarking of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Large-Scale Flow Control Jannis Becktepe 1 2 Aleksandra Franz 3 Nils Thuerey 3 Sebastian Peitz 1 2 6 2 0 2 1 2 ] . [ 1 5 1 0 5 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r aReinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in active flow control (AFC), yet progress in the field remains difficult to assess as existing studies rely on heterogeneous observation and actuation schemes, numerical setups, and evaluation protocols. Current AFC benchmarks attempt to address these issues but heavily rely on external computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, are not fully differentiable, and provide limited 3D and multi-agent support. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FluidGym, the first standalone, fully differentiable benchmark suite for RL in AFC. Built entirely in PyTorch on top of the GPU-accelerated PICT solver, FluidGym runs in single Python stack, requires no external CFD software, and provides standardized evaluation protocols. We present baseline results with PPO and SAC and release all environments, datasets, and trained models as public resources. FluidGym enables systematic comparison of control methods, establishes scalable foundation for future research in learning-based flow control, and is available at https://github. com/safe-autonomous-systems/ fluidgym. 1. Introduction Active flow control (AFC) plays central role in wide range of real-world systems, such as aerodynamics (Batikh et al., 2017), energy harvesting (Barthelmie et al., 2009), nuclear fusion (Pironti & Walker, 2005), and reduction of turbulence (Jimenez, 2013). Europe, for instance, could save 106 tonnes of CO2 per year by reducing more than 20 drag on cars using AFC (Brunton & Noack, 2015). 1TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany 2Lamarr Institute for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Dortmund, Germany 3Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany. Correspondence to: Jannis Becktepe <jannis.becktepe@tudortmund.de>. Preprint. January 22, 2026. 1 Figure 1. The four uncontrolled environment classes in FluidGym. However, manually designing control strategies is challenging due to the high dimensionality and inherent nonlinearities of such systems (Duriez et al., 2017). Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated strong potential for advancing AFC in complex systems, e.g., stabilizing the plasma in Tokamak reactor (Degrave et al., 2022). Despite its success, research in RL for flow control remains fragmented, and establishing clear state of the art is difficult for several reasons. Experimental setups vary widely across studies in terms of actuators, sensor placements, and physical parameter settings as well as RL algorithms and hyperparameters (Viquerat et al., 2022; Moslem et al., 2025). This results in inconsistent problem formulations that hinder direct comparisons. Moreover, insufficiently rigorous evaluation and the use of few random seeds increase statistical variance (Henderson et al., 2018; Agarwal et al., 2021). Existing benchmarks (see Table 1) have seen limited adoption for two main reasons. First, most rely on external computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers that must be installed, configured, and coupled to Python RL code through additional interfaces, which demands CFD expertise and creates brittle software stacks. Second, differentiability is either absent or limited to small subset of scenarios, which prevents end-to-end use of differentiable predictive control (DPC, Drgoˇna et al. (2022)) and recent differentiable RL methods that can accelerate training and outperform classical RL (Xing et al., 2025; Lagemann et al., 2025b). Plug-and-Play Benchmarking of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Large-Scale Flow Control To address these limitations, we introduce FluidGym, the first standalone, fully differentiable RL benchmark for AFC in incompressible flows. Building entirely on PyTorch (Ansel et al., 2024), FluidGym requires no external solver dependencies and seamlessly integrates with common RL interfaces such as Gymnasium (Towers et al., 2024) or PettingZoo (Terry et al., 2021) and algorithm frameworks like Stable-Baselines3 (Raffin et al., 2021) or TorchRL (Bou et al., 2023). As all simulations and control interfaces live in one Python package, users can install FluidGym via pip and immediately run experiments with standard RL libraries, without compiling or coupling external CFD codes. Being inherently end-to-end differentiable, FluidGym enables researchers to use gradient-based control methods alongside classical RL without any further modifications. Our benchmark provides diverse environments with consistent task definitions, supports single-agent (SARL) and multiagent (MARL) settings, spans three difficulty levels in 2D and 3D, and enables transfer-learning studies. In summary, our main contributions are (1) the first standalone, fully differentiable, plug-and-play benchmark for RL in AFC, implemented in single PyTorch codebase without external solver dependencies; (2) collection of standardized environment configurations spanning diverse 3D and MARL control tasks (see Figure 1); (3) an extensive experimental study covering all FluidGym environments and difficulty levels, including transfer-learning evaluations, amounting to over 16 GPU hours, all publicly available. 2. Background and Related Work RL for AFC Fluid flows are governed by the NavierStokes equations, set of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) exhibiting highly complex behavior over wide range of scales both in space and time. Due to their inherent complexity, analytical solutions are infeasible without substantial simplifications. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become standard approach to approximate solutions using spatial and temporal discretization (Ferziger et al., 2020). Such simulations, however, are computationally expensive and typically require specialized solvers such as OpenFOAM (Weller et al., 1998), FEniCS (Alnæs et al., 2015), or FLEXI (Krais et al., 2021). In many applications, the goal is not only to simulate the flow but to manipulate it. Active flow control (AFC) uses actuation to influence fluid motion, e.g., to reduce aerodynamic drag (Nair et al., 2019). Classical AFC approaches have demonstrated notable successes, ranging from the re-laminarization of turbulent channel flows using adjointbased model-predictive control (MPC) (Bewley et al., 2001) to control of the separation bubble behind bluff body us"

STAR improves table representation through semantic clustering and weighted fusion to enhance query-table alignment in table retrieval tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Table retrieval is the task of retrieving the most relevant tables from large-scale corpora given natural language queries. However, structural and semantic discrepancies between unstructured text and structured tables make embedding alignment particularly challenging. Recent methods such as QGpT attempt to enrich table semantics by generating synthetic queries, yet they still rely on coarse partial-table sampling and simple fusion strategies, which limit semantic diversity and hinder effective query-table alignment. We propose STAR (Semantic Table Representation), a lightweight framework that improves semantic table representation through semantic clustering and weighted fusion. STAR first applies header-aware K-means clustering to group semantically similar rows and selects representative centroid instances to construct a diverse partial table. It then generates cluster-specific synthetic queries to comprehensively cover the table's semantic space. Finally, STAR employs weighted fusion strategies to integrate table and query embeddings, enabling fine-grained semantic alignment. This design enables STAR to capture complementary information from structured and textual sources, improving the expressiveness of table representations. Experiments on five benchmarks show that STAR achieves consistently higher Recall than QGpT on all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of semantic clustering and adaptive weighted fusion for robust table representation.

"STAR improves table representation through semantic clustering and weighted fusion to enhance query-table alignment in table retrieval tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Table retrieval is the task of retrieving the most relevant tables from large-scale corpora given natural language queries. However, structural and semantic discrepancies between unstructured text and structured tables make embedding alignment particularly challenging. Recent methods such as QGpT attempt to enrich table semantics by generating synthetic queries, yet they still rely on coarse partial-table sampling and simple fusion strategies, which limit semantic diversity and hinder effective query-table alignment. We propose STAR (Semantic Table Representation), a lightweight framework that improves semantic table representation through semantic clustering and weighted fusion. STAR first applies header-aware K-means clustering to group semantically similar rows and selects representative centroid instances to construct a diverse partial table. It then generates cluster-specific synthetic queries to comprehensively cover the table's semantic space. Finally, STAR employs weighted fusion strategies to integrate table and query embeddings, enabling fine-grained semantic alignment. This design enables STAR to capture complementary information from structured and textual sources, improving the expressiveness of table representations. Experiments on five benchmarks show that STAR achieves consistently higher Recall than QGpT on all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of semantic clustering and adaptive weighted fusion for robust table representation. Our code is available at https://github.com/adsl135789/STAR."

DeepPlanning benchmark addresses limitations of current LLM planning assessments by introducing complex, real-world tasks requiring both global optimization and local constraint reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 While agent evaluation has shifted toward long-horizon tasks, most benchmarks still emphasize local, step-level reasoning rather than the global constrained optimization (e.g., time and financial budgets) that demands genuine planning ability. Meanwhile, existing LLM planning benchmarks underrepresent the active information gathering and fine-grained local constraints typical of real-world settings. To address this, we introduce DeepPlanning, a challenging benchmark for practical long-horizon agent planning. It features multi-day travel planning and multi-product shopping tasks that require proactive information acquisition, local constrained reasoning, and global constrained optimization. Evaluations on DeepPlanning show that even frontier agentic LLMs struggle with these problems, highlighting the importance of reliable explicit reasoning patterns and parallel tool use for achieving better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Error analysis further points to promising directions for improving agentic LLMs over long planning horizons. We open-source the code and data to support future research.

Visual token compression in LVLMs reduces model robustness by causing instability in token importance ranking, leading to vulnerability under compressed inference that persists even when compression is disabled.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual token compression is widely adopted to improve the inference efficiency of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), enabling their deployment in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained scenarios. However, existing work has mainly focused on efficiency and performance, while the security implications of visual token compression remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first reveal that visual token compression substantially degrades the robustness of LVLMs: models that are robust under uncompressed inference become highly vulnerable once compression is enabled. These vulnerabilities are state-specific; failure modes emerge only in the compressed setting and completely disappear when compression is disabled, making them particularly hidden and difficult to diagnose. By analyzing the key stages of the compression process, we identify instability in token importance ranking as the primary cause of this robustness degradation. Small and imperceptible perturbations can significantly alter token rankings, leading the compression mechanism to mistakenly discard task-critical information and ultimately causing model failure. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Compression-Aware Attack to systematically study and exploit this vulnerability. CAA directly targets the token selection mechanism and induces failures exclusively under compressed inference. We further extend this approach to more realistic black-box settings and introduce Transfer CAA, where neither the target model nor the compression configuration is accessible. We further evaluate potential defenses and find that they provide only limited protection. Extensive experiments across models, datasets, and compression methods show that visual token compression significantly undermines robustness, revealing a previously overlooked efficiency-security trade-off.

TensorLens presents a novel mathematical framework that represents the complete transformer architecture as a single input-dependent linear operator using high-order tensors, enabling comprehensive analysis of attention mechanisms and model components.  					AI-generated summary 				 Attention matrices are fundamental to transformer research, supporting a broad range of applications including interpretability, visualization, manipulation, and distillation. Yet, most existing analyses focus on individual attention heads or layers, failing to account for the model's global behavior. While prior efforts have extended attention formulations across multiple heads via averaging and matrix multiplications or incorporated components such as normalization and FFNs, a unified and complete representation that encapsulates all transformer blocks is still lacking. We address this gap by introducing TensorLens, a novel formulation that captures the entire transformer as a single, input-dependent linear operator expressed through a high-order attention-interaction tensor. This tensor jointly encodes attention, FFNs, activations, normalizations, and residual connections, offering a theoretically coherent and expressive linear representation of the model's computation. TensorLens is theoretically grounded and our empirical validation shows that it yields richer representations than previous attention-aggregation methods. Our experiments demonstrate that the attention tensor can serve as a powerful foundation for developing tools aimed at interpretability and model understanding. Our code is attached as a supplementary.

FluidGym presents a standalone, fully differentiable reinforcement learning benchmark for active flow control that operates without external CFD solvers and supports standardized evaluation protocols.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in active flow control (AFC), yet progress in the field remains difficult to assess as existing studies rely on heterogeneous observation and actuation schemes, numerical setups, and evaluation protocols. Current AFC benchmarks attempt to address these issues but heavily rely on external computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, are not fully differentiable, and provide limited 3D and multi-agent support. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FluidGym, the first standalone, fully differentiable benchmark suite for RL in AFC. Built entirely in PyTorch on top of the GPU-accelerated PICT solver, FluidGym runs in a single Python stack, requires no external CFD software, and provides standardized evaluation protocols. We present baseline results with PPO and SAC and release all environments, datasets, and trained models as public resources. FluidGym enables systematic comparison of control methods, establishes a scalable foundation for future research in learning-based flow control, and is available at https://github.com/safe-autonomous-systems/fluidgym.
