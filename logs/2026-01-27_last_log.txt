Text:"6 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 5 9 8 7 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r a Han Zhang Yinghao Xu Xing Zhu Yujun Shen Nan Xue Project Lead Spatial visual perception is fundamental requirement in physical-world applications like autonomous driving and robotic manipulation, driven by the need to interact with 3D environments. Capturing pixel-aligned metric depth using RGB-D cameras would be the most viable way, yet it usually faces obstacles posed by hardware limitations and challenging imaging conditions, especially in the presence of specular or texture-less surfaces. In this work, we argue that the inaccuracies from depth sensors can be viewed as masked signals that inherently reflect underlying geometric ambiguities. Building on this motivation, we present LingBot-Depth, depth completion model which leverages visual context to refine depth maps through masked depth modeling and incorporates an automated data curation pipeline for scalable training. It is encouraging to see that our model outperforms top-tier RGB-D cameras in terms of both depth precision and pixel coverage.

Text:"6 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 5 9 8 7 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r aHan Zhang Yinghao Xu Xing Zhu Yujun Shen Nan Xue Project Lead Spatial visual perception is fundamental requirement in physical-world applications like autonomous driving and robotic manipulation, driven by the need to interact with 3D environments. Capturing pixel-aligned metric depth using RGB-D cameras would be the most viable way, yet it usually faces obstacles posed by hardware limitations and challenging imaging conditions, especially in the presence of specular or texture-less surfaces. In this work, we argue that the inaccuracies from depth sensors can be viewed as masked signals that inherently reflect underlying geometric ambiguities. Building on this motivation, we present LingBot-Depth, depth completion model which leverages visual context to refine depth maps through masked depth modeling and incorporates an automated data curation pipeline for scalable training. It is encouraging to see that our model outperforms top-tier RGB-D cameras in terms of both depth precision and pixel coverage. Experimental results on range of downstream tasks further suggest that LingBot-Depth offers an aligned latent representation across RGB and depth modalities. We release the code, checkpoint, and 3M RGB-depth pairs (including 2M real data and 1M simulated data) to the community of spatial perception.

It provides the essential context for localization (where am I?) and scene understanding (what is around me?). Without robust 3D perception, real-world actions cannot be reliably planned, executed, or verified. Consequently, the pursuit of accurate 3D sensing has become central pillar of research on physical-grounded artificial intelligence. The optimal approach to achieving this goal remains subject of debate, with current methods generally falling into three paradigms: (1) classic multi-view visual geometry and recent learning-based adventures, (2) data-driven monocular depth estimation, and (3) active sensor-based depth measurement (e.g., LiDAR, ToF, Structured Light). While the trade-offs of each paradigm have been extensively discussed [13, 29, 33], the requirements for effective perception came down to three critical criteria: (1) absolute metric scale, (2) pixel-aligned dense geometry, and (3) real-time acquisition without computationally expensive post-processing. RGB-D cameras distinguish themselves as the only modality capable of satisfying these requirements in real-time. However, their utility is frequently compromised by inherent hardware limitations, particularly the susceptibility of stereo matching algorithms to appearance ambiguities. As illustrated in the left of Fig. 1, even state-of-the-art commercial sensors struggle in challenging scenariossuch as low-texture surfaces, specular reflections, and complex lighting conditions. These failures manifest as severe data corruption and missing values, directly violating the requirement for dense, pixel-aligned geometry. In this work, we propose paradigm shift: rather than treating these sensor failures as noise to be discarded, we leverage them as useful learning signal. Inspired by recent advances in self-supervised masked modeling [9] and joint embedding architectures [1], we introduce Masked Depth Modeling (MDM) to achieve dense, pixel-aligned scene geometry. key innovation of MDM is the interpretation of missing regions (holes) in raw depth maps as natural 1 Figure 1. Enhanced sensor depth powered by our proposed MDM pretraining, which leverages naturally missing depth measurements in RGB-D sensors as masks to learn metric-scale, complete, and accurate depth representations. The resulting LingBot-Depth model serves as powerful spatial perception prior for downstream applications, including 3D point tracking and dexterous grasping. masks, diverging from standard MAE approaches that rely solely on random masking. Because these natural masks arise specifically from geometric and appearance ambiguities (e.g., specular reflections), they present significantly harder reconstruction challenge than random dropout. To solve this, our architecture provides the full, unmasked RGB image as condition. The model is thus forced to infer the missing depth values by reasoning about the correlation between the complete RGB context and the remaining valid depth tokens. By unifying the objectives of monocular depth estimation and depth completion, our MDM framework serves as versatile generalist capable of yielding metric-scale, pixel-aligned, dense depth maps from arbitrary RGB-D inputs. The transition between these tasks is governed simply by the masking strategy within the Transformer. In the extreme case where all depth tokens are masked, the model functions as pure Monocular Depth Estimator, forcing the Self-Attention layers to exploit RGB context alone to infer geometry. Conversely, for Depth Completion, we mask only the invalid (sensor-corrupted) tokens, allowing the model to fuse the sparse valid depth readings with visual cues to reconstruct complete, dense depth prediction. To support large-scale MDM training, we built scalable data curation pipeline that bridges raw sensor data and reliable supervision. The pipeline includes two parallel streams: synthetic branch based on self-hosted 3D assets, and real-world branch using modular, 3D-printed capture rig compatible with variety of consumer RGB-D cameras, including active stereo (Intel RealSense, Orbbec Gemini) and passive stereo (ZED) systems. Using this setup, we collected 1M synthetic samples and 2M real captures, each containing synchronized RGB images, raw sensor depth, and stereo pairs. The stereo pairs enable pseudo-depth supervision through custom stereo matching network adapted from FoundationStereo [33] and trained on synthetic data. We further enrich this corpus with several public RGB-D datasets [4, 19, 21, 22, 30, 36, 37], forming diverse training set for robust depth completion. Pretraining ViT-Large on this curated RGB-D corpus with Masked Depth Modeling allows metric geometry to be integrated into semantic tokens via attention, thus improving the sensing quality of RGB-D cameras, a"

LingBot-Depth is a depth completion model that uses visual context to refine depth maps through masked depth modeling and automated data curation for improved spatial perception in robotics and autonomous systems.  					AI-generated summary 				 Spatial visual perception is a fundamental requirement in physical-world applications like autonomous driving and robotic manipulation, driven by the need to interact with 3D environments. Capturing pixel-aligned metric depth using RGB-D cameras would be the most viable way, yet it usually faces obstacles posed by hardware limitations and challenging imaging conditions, especially in the presence of specular or texture-less surfaces. In this work, we argue that the inaccuracies from depth sensors can be viewed as "masked" signals that inherently reflect underlying geometric ambiguities. Building on this motivation, we present LingBot-Depth, a depth completion model which leverages visual context to refine depth maps through masked depth modeling and incorporates an automated data curation pipeline for scalable training. It is encouraging to see that our model outperforms top-tier RGB-D cameras in terms of both depth precision and pixel coverage. Experimental results on a range of downstream tasks further suggest that LingBot-Depth offers an aligned latent representation across RGB and depth modalities. We release the code, checkpoint, and 3M RGB-depth pairs (including 2M real data and 1M simulated data) to the community of spatial perception.

Авторы предлагают автоматический pipeline кураций данных для масштабируемого обучения модели на комбинированных наборах реальных и синтетических данных. Экспериментальные результаты показывают, что LingBot-Depth превосходит современные RGB-D камеры по точности и покрытию пикселей, обеспечивая согласованное представление между RGB и глубинными модальностями для систем пространственного восприятия.",
