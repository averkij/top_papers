Text:"Teaching Models to Teach Themselves: Reasoning at the Edge of Learnability Shobhita Sundaram1,, John Quan2, Ariel Kwiatkowski2, Kartik Ahuja2, Yann Ollivier2, Julia Kempe2,3 1MIT, 2Meta FAIR, 3New York University Work done during an internship at Meta Can model learn to escape its own learning plateau? Reinforcement learning methods for finetuning large reasoning models stall on datasets with low initial success rates, and thus little training signal. We investigate fundamental question: Can pretrained LLM leverage latent knowledge to generate an automated curriculum for problems it cannot solve? To explore this, we design SOAR: selfimprovement framework designed to surface these pedagogical signals through meta-RL. teacher copy of the model proposes synthetic problems for student copy, and is rewarded with its improvement on small subset of hard problems. Critically, SOAR grounds the curriculum in measured student progress rather than intrinsic proxy rewards. Our study on the hardest subsets of mathematical benchmarks (0/128 success) reveals three core findings. First, we show that it is possible to realize bi-level meta-RL that unlocks learning under sparse, binary rewards by sharpening latent capacity of pretrained models to generate useful stepping stones. Second, grounded rewards outperform intrinsic reward schemes used in prior LLM self-play, reliably avoiding the instability and diversity collapse modes they typically exhibit. Third, analyzing the generated questions reveals that structural quality and well-posedness are more critical for learning progress than solution correctness. Our results suggest that the ability to generate useful stepping stones does not require the preexisting ability to actually solve the hard problems, paving principled path to escape reasoning plateaus without additional curated data.

Previous approaches typically assume uniform standard and optimize for generic preferences that are broadly acceptable [2]. However, human values are highly diverse. Preferences vary significantly across individuals, which makes single standard insufficient [3]. Therefore, recent work emphasizes personalized alignment to address the plurality of user intents and contexts [4]. By tailoring model behavior to individual needs, personalized alignment enables LLMs to respect unique user preferences rather than following single monolithic objective [5, 3]. The alignment of LLMs relies on human feedback to provide learning signals that guide model behavCorresponding authors. iors. Standard approaches, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [6], optimize LLMs by comparing responses ranked by human preference [6, 7, 8, 9]. However, keeping humanin-the-loop to provide continuous feedback is impractical [2, 10]. This challenge is even greater in personalized alignment, as we cannot expect every single user to actively provide feedback to align the model. This drives the research on personalized reward models, which learn individual preferences and provide personalized feedback automatically [11, 12, 13]. While personalized reward models are essential for achieving personalized alignment, their development still faces unique challenges. 1) Scarcity of personalized feedback. General reward models typically rely on massive preference data to capture preference patterns [14], but gathering such extensive feedback from single user is impractical. Simply aggregating data from other users is ineffective, as their conflictOne Adapts to Any: Meta Reward Modeling for Personalized LLM Alignment entirely on the quality of the input context. This fails under sparse feedback, as the limited context cannot distinguish unique user intents, forcing the model into coarse-grained approximation [17] instead of fine-grained personalization. 2) Personalized parameter methods (see Figure 1 (b)) allocate user-specific parameters, such as LoRA adapters or separate models [12, 18, 19]. Although this allows for fine-grained alignment, it struggles to adapt to unseen users. Training user-specific parameters from scratch is infeasible in the few-shot scenario, as sparse feedback inevitably leads to overfitting and poor generalization. Consequently, neither paradigm can simultaneously efficiently adapt to unseen users while maintaining fine-grained personalization under limited user feedback. This dilemma implies that current optimization paradigms are inadequate and calls for fundamenIn this work, we reframe tal shift in perspective. personalized reward modeling through the lens of meta-learning, treating each individuals preference modeling as distinct learning task. Instead of relying on fitting data to learn each individual preference, we expect that the model could learn the process of preference adaptation (i.e., learning to learn). Specifically, we implement this idea by learning highly adaptable model initialization from users (see Figure 1 (c)). We employ bi-level optimization framework: the inner loop mimics the adaptation to individual users using sparse feedback, while the outer loop updates the initialization to achieve faster adaptation across users. By learning from this adaptation process, the model captures intrinsic preference commonalities across diverse users and thus serves as starting point that can rapidly converge to any users intent. Building on this insight, we propose Meta Reward Modeling (MRM). To enable lightweight per-user adaptation, we model each user reward as lowdimensional weight combination over shared basis reward functions [20, 15] and employ ModelAgnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) [21]-style framework to optimize the initialization of the weights. However, given the diversity of human values, some users are naturally harder to model than others. Standard meta-learning treats all users equally, aiming to maximize the average performance. ConseFigure 1: Comparison of personalized reward modeling methods: (a) Personalized input incorporates user contexts; (b) Personalized parameter assigns user-specific parameters; (c) Meta Reward Modeling formulates personalization as meta-learning problem by learning an adaptable initialization. ing preferences would confuse the model. Thus, the personalized feedback available for each user is inherently sparse, making it challenging to model their unique intent. 2) Adaptation to unseen users. It is impractical to collect data from every potential user in advance. As result, personalized reward models must handle unseen users1 whose feedback was not pre-collected, and quickly adapt to th"

Agentic mid-training enables large language models to develop autonomous software engineering capabilities through specialized data synthesis techniques that bridge the gap between static training data and dynamic development environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, the frontier of Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities has shifted from single-turn code generation to agentic software engineering-a paradigm where models autonomously navigate, edit, and test complex repositories. While post-training methods have become the de facto approach for code agents, **agentic mid-training**-mid-training (MT) on large-scale data that mirrors authentic agentic workflows-remains critically underexplored due to substantial resource requirements, despite offering a more scalable path to instilling foundational agentic behaviors than relying solely on expensive reinforcement learning. A central challenge in realizing effective agentic mid-training is the distribution mismatch between static training data and the dynamic, feedback-rich environment of real development. To address this, we present a systematic study of agentic mid-training, establishing both the data synthesis principles and training methodology for effective agent development at scale. Central to our approach is **agent-native data**-supervision comprising two complementary types of trajectories: **contextually-native trajectories** that preserve the complete information flow an agent experiences, offering broad coverage and diversity; and **environmentally-native trajectories** collected from executable repositories where observations stem from actual tool invocations and test executions, providing depth and interaction authenticity. We verify the model's agentic capabilities on `SWE-Bench Verified`. We demonstrate our superiority over the previous open software engineering mid-training recipe `Kimi-Dev` under two post-training settings with an aligned base model and agentic scaffold, while using less than half mid-training tokens (73.1B).

A self-improvement framework enables pretrained language models to generate automated curricula for solving previously unsolvable problems by leveraging latent knowledge and meta-reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Can a model learn to escape its own learning plateau? Reinforcement learning methods for finetuning large reasoning models stall on datasets with low initial success rates, and thus little training signal. We investigate a fundamental question: Can a pretrained LLM leverage latent knowledge to generate an automated curriculum for problems it cannot solve? To explore this, we design SOAR: A self-improvement framework designed to surface these pedagogical signals through meta-RL. A teacher copy of the model proposes synthetic problems for a student copy, and is rewarded with its improvement on a small subset of hard problems. Critically, SOAR grounds the curriculum in measured student progress rather than intrinsic proxy rewards. Our study on the hardest subsets of mathematical benchmarks (0/128 success) reveals three core findings. First, we show that it is possible to realize bi-level meta-RL that unlocks learning under sparse, binary rewards by sharpening a latent capacity of pretrained models to generate useful stepping stones. Second, grounded rewards outperform intrinsic reward schemes used in prior LLM self-play, reliably avoiding the instability and diversity collapse modes they typically exhibit. Third, analyzing the generated questions reveals that structural quality and well-posedness are more critical for learning progress than solution correctness. Our results suggest that the ability to generate useful stepping stones does not require the preexisting ability to actually solve the hard problems, paving a principled path to escape reasoning plateaus without additional curated data.

"A self-improvement framework enables pretrained language models to generate automated curricula for solving previously unsolvable problems by leveraging latent knowledge and meta-reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Can a model learn to escape its own learning plateau? Reinforcement learning methods for finetuning large reasoning models stall on datasets with low initial success rates, and thus little training signal. We investigate a fundamental question: Can a pretrained LLM leverage latent knowledge to generate an automated curriculum for problems it cannot solve? To explore this, we design SOAR: A self-improvement framework designed to surface these pedagogical signals through meta-RL. A teacher copy of the model proposes synthetic problems for a student copy, and is rewarded with its improvement on a small subset of hard problems. Critically, SOAR grounds the curriculum in measured student progress rather than intrinsic proxy rewards. Our study on the hardest subsets of mathematical benchmarks (0/128 success) reveals three core findings. First, we show that it is possible to realize bi-level meta-RL that unlocks learning under sparse, binary rewards by sharpening a latent capacity of pretrained models to generate useful stepping stones. Second, grounded rewards outperform intrinsic reward schemes used in prior LLM self-play, reliably avoiding the instability and diversity collapse modes they typically exhibit. Third, analyzing the generated questions reveals that structural quality and well-posedness are more critical for learning progress than solution correctness. Our results suggest that the ability to generate useful stepping stones does not require the preexisting ability to actually solve the hard problems, paving a principled path to escape reasoning plateaus without additional curated data."

Meta Reward Modeling reformulates personalized reward modeling as a meta-learning problem to enable efficient adaptation to individual users with limited feedback.  					AI-generated summary 				 Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to align outputs with human preferences, and personalized alignment further adapts models to individual users. This relies on personalized reward models that capture user-specific preferences and automatically provide individualized feedback. However, developing these models faces two critical challenges: the scarcity of feedback from individual users and the need for efficient adaptation to unseen users. We argue that addressing these constraints requires a paradigm shift from fitting data to learn user preferences to learn the process of preference adaptation. To realize this, we propose Meta Reward Modeling (MRM), which reformulates personalized reward modeling as a meta-learning problem. Specifically, we represent each user's reward model as a weighted combination of base reward functions, and optimize the initialization of these weights using a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)-style framework to support fast adaptation under limited feedback. To ensure robustness, we introduce the Robust Personalization Objective (RPO), which places greater emphasis on hard-to-learn users during meta optimization. Extensive experiments on personalized preference datasets validate that MRM enhances few-shot personalization, improves user robustness, and consistently outperforms baselines.
