Text:"TSRBENCH: Comprehensive Multi-task Multi-modal Time SeriesFangxu Yu 1 Xingang Guo 2 Lingzhi Yuan 1 Haoqiang Kang 3 Hongyu Zhao 1 Lianhui Qin 3 Furong Huang 1 Bin Hu 2 Tianyi Zhou1. Introduction 6 2 0 2 6 2 ] . [ 1 4 4 7 8 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r Time series data is ubiquitous in real-world scenarios and crucial for critical applications ranging from energy management to traffic control. Consequently, the ability to reason over time series is fundamental skill for generalist models to solve practical problems. However, this dimension is notably absent from existing benchmarks of generalist models. To bridge this gap, we introduce TSRBENCH, comprehensive multi-modal benchmark designed to stress-test the full spectrum of time series reasoning capabilities. TSRBENCH features: (i) diverse set of 4125 problems from 14 domains, and is categorized into 4 major dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, Prediction, and Decision-Making. (ii) 15 tasks from the 4 dimensions evaluating essential reasoning capabilities (e.g., numerical reasoning). Through extensive experiments, we evaluated over 30 leading proprietary and open-source LLMs, VLMs, and TSLLMs within TSRBENCH. Our findings reveal that: i) scaling laws hold for perception and reasoning but break down for prediction; ii) strong reasoning does not guarantee accurate contextaware forecasting, indicating decoupling between semantic understanding and numerical prediction; and iii) despite the complementary nature of textual and visual represenations of time series as inputs, current multimodal models fail to effectively fuse them for reciprocal performance gains. TSRBENCH provides standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance generalist models. Our code and dataset are available at https://tsrbench.github.io/. 1University of Maryland, College Park 2University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign 3University of California, San Diego 4Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence. Correspondence to: Tianyi Zhou <tianyi.david.zhou@gmail.com>. 1 Time series data pervades real-world environments and underpins decision-making across high-stakes domains, including finance (Dong et al., 2024), healthcare (Morid et al., 2023), and industrial systems (Yan et al., 2024). Since substantial portion of real-world information is inherently temporal, reasoning on time series becomes core capability for building generalist models that can reliably solve practical problems. Equipping models with such reasoning abilities enables automated systems to interpret temporal signals in context, supporting downstream applications such as education (Mao et al., 2024), clinical management (Matowe et al., 2003), disaster forecasting (Hakim et al., 2024), and scientific discovery (Yu et al., 2025c). Given the critical importance of time series reasoning, there is pressing need for standardized and automated evaluation frameworks that enable comprehensive assessment and comparison. However, existing work remains largely anchored in traditional time series analysis, which adopts reductive view by treating time series as isolated numerical sequencesthereby stripping away the causal structure and semantic context essential for real-world problemsolving. Recent benchmarks have begun to integrate context (Williams et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Cai et al., 2024a; Kong et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025), yet they predominantly target surface-level pattern understanding, which is insufficient for complex problem-solving. Other initiatives that attempt to probe reasoning capabilities (Chen et al., 2025b; Wang et al., 2025c; Guan et al., 2025) often remain confined to narrow domains or restricted task scopes. This systemic limitation underscores the urgent demand for comprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmark specifically designed to stress-test the full spectrum of time series reasoning. In this paper, we introduce TSRBENCH, large-scale and comprehensive benchmark curated to assess the time series problem-solving capability of generalist models across multiple domains and tasks. TSRBENCH extensively collect, select, and synthesize problems from 14 domains. This extensive collection has culminated in benchmark comprising 4125 problems. We categorize the problems into four TSRBENCH: Comprehensive Multi-task Multi-modal Time Series Reasoning Benchmark for Generalist Models Table 1: Comparison with Representative Time Series Benchmarks.

Additionally, it supports four modalities of time series for generalist models: text, image, text-image interleaved, and time series embeddings, providing comprehensive evaluation and comparison that modern AI systems could handle. To facilitate the evaluation of LLMs and MLLMs, we design unified evaluation setup. Time series are transformed into textual sequences of numbers for LLMs and into plots for VLMs. For proprietary models, we evaluate text-form (T), vision-form (V), and combined (T+V) representation to test modality fusion. Based on TSRBENCH, we evaluate 6 leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-5 (OpenAI, 2025)), 12 open-source LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 (Yang et al., 2025a)), 13 open-source VLMs (e.g., InternVL3.5 (Wang et al., 2025b)). Our evaluation yields three key findings: i) While current generalist models demonstrate strong performance on time series perception, they struggle significantly with complex reasoning, forecasting, and decision-making tasks. ii) The scaling law holds for most time series reasoning tasks on both LLMs and VLMs, with the notable exception of time series prediction. iii) Time Series Prediction tasks have weak relationship"

TSRBench presents a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for evaluating time series reasoning capabilities across perception, reasoning, prediction, and decision-making dimensions, revealing that scaling laws and reasoning abilities do not uniformly apply to time series forecasting tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Time series data is ubiquitous in real-world scenarios and crucial for critical applications ranging from energy management to traffic control. Consequently, the ability to reason over time series is a fundamental skill for generalist models to solve practical problems. However, this dimension is notably absent from existing benchmarks of generalist models. To bridge this gap, we introduce TSRBench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark designed to stress-test the full spectrum of time series reasoning capabilities. TSRBench features: i) a diverse set of 4125 problems from 14 domains, and is categorized into 4 major dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, Prediction, and Decision-Making. ii) 15 tasks from the 4 dimensions evaluating essential reasoning capabilities (e.g., numerical reasoning). Through extensive experiments, we evaluated over 30 leading proprietary and open-source LLMs, VLMs, and TSLLMs within TSRBench. Our findings reveal that: i) scaling laws hold for perception and reasoning but break down for prediction; ii) strong reasoning does not guarantee accurate context-aware forecasting, indicating a decoupling between semantic understanding and numerical prediction; and iii) despite the complementary nature of textual and visual represenations of time series as inputs, current multimodal models fail to effectively fuse them for reciprocal performance gains. TSRBench provides a standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance generalist models. Our code and dataset are available at https://tsrbench.github.io/.

Исследователи оценили более 30 ведущих больших языковых моделей и мультимодальных моделей на наборе из 4125 задач из 14 различных областей. Основные результаты показывают, что закономерности масштабирования работают для восприятия и рассуждений, но не применимы к задачам предсказания, а также выявляют расхождение между семантическим пониманием и числовым прогнозированием. Работа демонстрирует, что даже мультимодальные модели не могут эффективно объединять текстовые и визуальные представления временных рядов для взаимного улучшения качества.",
