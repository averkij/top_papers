Multi-image reasoning safety benchmark reveals that advanced multimodal models exhibit increased vulnerability and superficial safety responses, with unsafe generations showing lower attention entropy.  					AI-generated summary 				 As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) acquire stronger reasoning capabilities to handle complex, multi-image instructions, this advancement may pose new safety risks. We study this problem by introducing MIR-SafetyBench, the first benchmark focused on multi-image reasoning safety, which consists of 2,676 instances across a taxonomy of 9 multi-image relations. Our extensive evaluations on 19 MLLMs reveal a troubling trend: models with more advanced multi-image reasoning can be more vulnerable on MIR-SafetyBench. Beyond attack success rates, we find that many responses labeled as safe are superficial, often driven by misunderstanding or evasive, non-committal replies. We further observe that unsafe generations exhibit lower attention entropy than safe ones on average. This internal signature suggests a possible risk that models may over-focus on task solving while neglecting safety constraints. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/thu-coai/MIR-SafetyBench.

Исследование показало парадоксальную тенденцию: модели с более развитыми способностями к мультиизображенному рассуждению становятся более уязвимы для небезопасных генераций. Авторы выявили, что многие ответы, помеченные как безопасные, носят поверхностный характер и основаны на неправильном понимании или уклончивых ответах. Анализ внутренних механизмов показал, что небезопасные выходы характеризуются низкой энтропией внимания, что указывает на чрезмерную концентрацию модели на решении задачи в ущерб соблюдению ограничений безопасности.",
