Text:"6 2 0 2 4 2 ] . [ 1 3 2 3 7 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r SkyReels-V3 Technique Report SkyReels TeamVideo generation serves as cornerstone for building world models, where multimodal contextual inference stands as the defining test of capability. In this end, we present SkyReels-V3, conditional video generation model, built upon unified multimodal in-context learning framework with diffusion Transformers. SkyReelsV3 model supports three core generative paradigms within single architecture: reference images-to-video synthesis, video-to-video extension and audio-guided video generation. (i) reference images-to-video model is designed to produce highfidelity videos with strong subject identity preservation, temporal coherence, and narrative consistency. To enhance reference adherence and compositional stability, we design comprehensive data processing pipeline that leverages cross-frame pairing, image editing, and semantic rewriting, effectively mitigating copypaste artifacts. During training, an imagevideo hybrid strategy combined with multiresolution joint optimization is employed to improve generalization and robustness across diverse scenarios. (ii) video extension model integrates spatio-temporal consistency modeling with large-scale video understanding, enabling both seamless single-shot continuation and intelligent multi-shot switching with professional cinematographic patterns. (iii) Talking avatar model supports minute-level audioconditioned video generation by training first-and-last frame insertion patterns and reconstructing key-frame inference paradigms. On the basis of ensuring visual quality, synchronization of audio and videos has been optimized. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SkyReels-V3 achieves state-of-the-art or near state-ofthe-art performance on key metrics including visual quality, instruction following, and specific aspect metrics, approaching leading closed-source systems. Github: https://github.com/SkyworkAI/SkyReels-V3.World models aim to capture, simulate, and forecast the dynamics of complex real-world environments, and they form fundamental basis for deploying artificial intelligence in practical scenarios [11]. In between, video generation frameworks encode rich geometric, semantic, and physical knowledge through the synthesis of visual sequences, thereby enabling effective modeling and prediction of the physical world, especially for multi-modal conditions. In recent years, diffusion-based Transformers [13, 4] architecture has driven significant advances in video generation. wide range of commercial systemsincluding Veo [7], Sora [12], Seedance [6, 2], Kling [9], as well as opensource models such as Wanx [14], HunyuanVideo [15, 8], SkyReels [1], and CogVideoX [17], have demonstrated strong performance across multiple dimensions. However, multimodal in-context in video generation is still under-explored. In this repport, we introduce SkyReels-V3, unified multimodal condition video generation framework, designed to support wide range of high-quality video synthesis tasks within single model family. Built upon multimodal in-context learning paradigm, SkyReels V3 seamlessly integrates visual reference, video, audio, and textual inputs to enable flexible and controllable video generation. The framework natively supports three core capabilities: reference images to video, video-to-video extension, and audio-guided video generation, also known as talking avatar. At the architectural Preprint. Figure 1: Reference Images to Video Results. SkyReels-V3 can facilitate dynamic interplay between different subjects within specified contexts. Figure 2: Reference Images to Video Results. SkyReels-V3 can enable dynamic interactions between diverse subjects (characters/objects) within arbitrary scenes. level, SkyReels-V3 incorporates large-scale diffusion Transformers while with carefully designed alignment strategies with multimodal condition and advanced spatiotemporal consistency modeling. Through hybrid imagevideo as well as multi-resolution joint optimization, the system achieves precise instruction following, high-fidelity motion generation and superior sub-domain capacity such as robust identity preservation and precise audio-visual synchronization. These design choices allow SkyReels-V3 to move beyond frame-level synthesis, enabling coherent narrative progression and cinematic-quality visual composition. With its strong generalization ability and modular design, SkyReels-V3 can be applied to diverse real-world scenarios, including professional video production, virtual avatars, short-form content creation, live-stream commerce, and digital entertainment. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SkyReels-V3 reaches or surpasses industry-leading performance across key metrics, making it powerful open-source foundation for next-generation video generation research and applications.The SkyReels-V3 model family supports range of capabilities, including multi-reference image-tovideo synthesis, audio-guided video generation, and video-to-video extension. This chapter provides detailed descriptions and performance evaluation to these features. 2.1 Reference Images to Video SkyReels-V3 can synthesizes temporally coherent video sequences conditioned on multiple visual references and textual prompt. Given one to four reference images, which may correspond to characters, objects, or background scenes, the model generates videos that preserve identity attributes, spatial composition, and narrative continuity while following high-level semantic instructions. 2 Figure 3: Reference Images to Video Results. SkyReels-V3 can enable instant video creation for diverse live commerce hosts and settings. Figure 4: Reference Images to Video Results. SkyReels-V3 can make advertising and product demonstration with one picture. Reference-Preserving Data Construction. For multi-reference image-guided video generation, the quality of the reference image-to-target video pairs is crucial. To this end, we introduce dedicated data processing pipeline. Initially, we filter video data from massive in house dataset, selecting clips that exhibit both high visual quality and significant dynamic motion. Then, reference frames are selected from continuous video sequences using cross-frame pairing strategy [5, 3], ensuring temporal diversity while maintaining semantic consistency. Image editing models [10, 16] are then applied to extract subject regions and perform background completion, together with semant"

Collecting human annotations for this application is prohibitively expensive due to long and complex exploration trajectories. We propose an agentic pipeline that automatically generates high-quality, difficulty-controlled deep search question-answer pairs for given corpus and target difficulty level. Our pipeline, SAGE, consists of data generator which proposes QA pairs and search agent which attempts to solve the generated question and provide execution feedback for the data generator. The two components interact over multiple rounds to iteratively refine the question-answer pairs until they satisfy the target difficulty level. Our intrinsic evaluation shows SAGE generates questions that require diverse reasoning strategies, while significantly increases the correctness and difficulty of the generated data. Our extrinsic evaluation demonstrates up to 23% relative performance gain on popular deep search benchmarks by training deep search agents with our synthetic data. Additional experiments show that agents trained on our data can adapt from fixed-corpus retrieval to Google Search at inference time, without further training. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as agents which interact with external environments and solve complicated tasks, such as coding (Dong et al., 2025; Jimenez et al., 2024), e-commerce and social forum discussion (Peeters et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2024).

Text:"Agentic Very Long Video Understanding Aniket Rege1,2,, Arka Sadhu1, Yuliang Li1, Kejie Li1, Ramya Korlakai Vinayak2, Yuning Chai1, Yong Jae Lee2, Hyo Jin Kim1 1Reality Labs Research at Meta, 2University of Wisconsin-Madison Work done at Meta The advent of always-on personal AI assistants, enabled by all-day wearable devices such as smart glasses, demands new level of contextual understanding, one that goes beyond short, isolated events to encompass the continuous, longitudinal stream of egocentric video. Achieving this vision requires advances in long-horizon video understanding, where systems must interpret and recall visual and audio information spanning days or even weeks. Existing methods, including large language models and retrieval-augmented generation, are constrained by limited context windows and lack the ability to perform compositional, multi-hop reasoning over very long video streams. In this work, we address these challenges through EGAgent, an enhanced agentic framework centered on entity scene graphs, which represent people, places, objects, and their relationships over time. Our system equips planning agent with tools for structured search and reasoning over these graphs, as well as hybrid visual and audio search capabilities, enabling detailed, cross-modal, and temporally coherent reasoning. Experiments on the EgoLifeQA and Video-MME (Long) datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on EgoLifeQA (57.5%) and competitive performance on Video-MME (Long) (74.1%) for complex longitudinal video understanding tasks.

Finite Scalar Quantization with improved activation mapping enables unified modeling of discrete and continuous image generation approaches, revealing optimal representation balance and performance characteristics.  					AI-generated summary 				 The field of image generation is currently bifurcated into autoregressive (AR) models operating on discrete tokens and diffusion models utilizing continuous latents. This divide, rooted in the distinction between VQ-VAEs and VAEs, hinders unified modeling and fair benchmarking. Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) offers a theoretical bridge, yet vanilla FSQ suffers from a critical flaw: its equal-interval quantization can cause activation collapse. This mismatch forces a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and information efficiency. In this work, we resolve this dilemma by simply replacing the activation function in original FSQ with a distribution-matching mapping to enforce a uniform prior. Termed iFSQ, this simple strategy requires just one line of code yet mathematically guarantees both optimal bin utilization and reconstruction precision. Leveraging iFSQ as a controlled benchmark, we uncover two key insights: (1) The optimal equilibrium between discrete and continuous representations lies at approximately 4 bits per dimension. (2) Under identical reconstruction constraints, AR models exhibit rapid initial convergence, whereas diffusion models achieve a superior performance ceiling, suggesting that strict sequential ordering may limit the upper bounds of generation quality. Finally, we extend our analysis by adapting Representation Alignment (REPA) to AR models, yielding LlamaGen-REPA. Codes is available at https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/iFSQ

Благодаря iFSQ как контролируемому бенчмарку исследователи выявили, что оптимальный баланс между дискретными и непрерывными представлениями достигается при 4 битах на размерность.

Self-refining video sampling improves motion coherence and physics alignment by using a pre-trained video generator as its own denoising autoencoder for iterative refinement with uncertainty-aware region selection.  					AI-generated summary 				 Modern video generators still struggle with complex physical dynamics, often falling short of physical realism. Existing approaches address this using external verifiers or additional training on augmented data, which is computationally expensive and still limited in capturing fine-grained motion. In this work, we present self-refining video sampling, a simple method that uses a pre-trained video generator trained on large-scale datasets as its own self-refiner. By interpreting the generator as a denoising autoencoder, we enable iterative inner-loop refinement at inference time without any external verifier or additional training. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware refinement strategy that selectively refines regions based on self-consistency, which prevents artifacts caused by over-refinement. Experiments on state-of-the-art video generators demonstrate significant improvements in motion coherence and physics alignment, achieving over 70\% human preference compared to the default sampler and guidance-based sampler.

CGPT improves table retrieval by using LLM-generated synthetic queries for contrastive fine-tuning of embedding models through semantically diverse partial table construction.  					AI-generated summary 				 General-purpose embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in text retrieval but remain suboptimal for table retrieval, where highly structured content leads to semantic compression and query-table mismatch. Recent LLM-based retrieval augmentation methods mitigate this issue by generating synthetic queries, yet they often rely on heuristic partial-table selection and seldom leverage these synthetic queries as supervision to improve the embedding model. We introduce CGPT, a training framework that enhances table retrieval through LLM-generated supervision. CGPT constructs semantically diverse partial tables by clustering table instances using K-means and sampling across clusters to broaden semantic coverage. An LLM then generates synthetic queries for these partial tables, which are used in hard-negative contrastive fine-tuning to refine the embedding model. Experiments across four public benchmarks (MimoTable, OTTQA, FetaQA, and E2E-WTQ) show that CGPT consistently outperforms retrieval baselines, including QGpT, with an average R@1 improvement of 16.54 percent. In a unified multi-domain corpus setting, CGPT further demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization and remains effective even when using smaller LLMs for synthetic query generation. These results indicate that semantically guided partial-table construction, combined with contrastive training from LLM-generated supervision, provides an effective and scalable paradigm for large-scale table retrieval.

RouteMoA reduces computational costs and latency in mixture-of-agents frameworks by using dynamic routing with lightweight scoring and judgment mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) improves LLM performance through layered collaboration, but its dense topology raises costs and latency. Existing methods employ LLM judges to filter responses, yet still require all models to perform inference before judging, failing to cut costs effectively. They also lack model selection criteria and struggle with large model pools, where full inference is costly and can exceed context limits. To address this, we propose RouteMoA, an efficient mixture-of-agents framework with dynamic routing. It employs a lightweight scorer to perform initial screening by predicting coarse-grained performance from the query, narrowing candidates to a high-potential subset without inference. A mixture of judges then refines these scores through lightweight self- and cross-assessment based on existing model outputs, providing posterior correction without additional inference. Finally, a model ranking mechanism selects models by balancing performance, cost, and latency. RouteMoA outperforms MoA across varying tasks and model pool sizes, reducing cost by 89.8% and latency by 63.6% in the large-scale model pool.

SkyReels-V3 is a unified multimodal video generation model that supports reference image-to-video, video-to-video extension, and audio-guided video generation through diffusion Transformers and in-context learning frameworks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video generation serves as a cornerstone for building world models, where multimodal contextual inference stands as the defining test of capability. In this end, we present SkyReels-V3, a conditional video generation model, built upon a unified multimodal in-context learning framework with diffusion Transformers. SkyReels-V3 model supports three core generative paradigms within a single architecture: reference images-to-video synthesis, video-to-video extension and audio-guided video generation. (i) reference images-to-video model is designed to produce high-fidelity videos with strong subject identity preservation, temporal coherence, and narrative consistency. To enhance reference adherence and compositional stability, we design a comprehensive data processing pipeline that leverages cross frame pairing, image editing, and semantic rewriting, effectively mitigating copy paste artifacts. During training, an image video hybrid strategy combined with multi-resolution joint optimization is employed to improve generalization and robustness across diverse scenarios. (ii) video extension model integrates spatio-temporal consistency modeling with large-scale video understanding, enabling both seamless single-shot continuation and intelligent multi-shot switching with professional cinematographic patterns. (iii) Talking avatar model supports minute-level audio-conditioned video generation by training first-and-last frame insertion patterns and reconstructing key-frame inference paradigms. On the basis of ensuring visual quality, synchronization of audio and videos has been optimized.   Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SkyReels-V3 achieves state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance on key metrics including visual quality, instruction following, and specific aspect metrics, approaching leading closed-source systems.

"SkyReels-V3 is a unified multimodal video generation model that supports reference image-to-video, video-to-video extension, and audio-guided video generation through diffusion Transformers and in-context learning frameworks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video generation serves as a cornerstone for building world models, where multimodal contextual inference stands as the defining test of capability. In this end, we present SkyReels-V3, a conditional video generation model, built upon a unified multimodal in-context learning framework with diffusion Transformers. SkyReels-V3 model supports three core generative paradigms within a single architecture: reference images-to-video synthesis, video-to-video extension and audio-guided video generation. (i) reference images-to-video model is designed to produce high-fidelity videos with strong subject identity preservation, temporal coherence, and narrative consistency. To enhance reference adherence and compositional stability, we design a comprehensive data processing pipeline that leverages cross frame pairing, image editing, and semantic rewriting, effectively mitigating copy paste artifacts. During training, an image video hybrid strategy combined with multi-resolution joint optimization is employed to improve generalization and robustness across diverse scenarios. (ii) video extension model integrates spatio-temporal consistency modeling with large-scale video understanding, enabling both seamless single-shot continuation and intelligent multi-shot switching with professional cinematographic patterns. (iii) Talking avatar model supports minute-level audio-conditioned video generation by training first-and-last frame insertion patterns and reconstructing key-frame inference paradigms. On the basis of ensuring visual quality, synchronization of audio and videos has been optimized.   Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SkyReels-V3 achieves state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance on key metrics including visual quality, instruction following, and specific aspect metrics, approaching leading closed-source systems.

UI Remix is an interactive system that supports mobile UI design through example-driven workflows using a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation model, enabling iterative design adaptation with source transparency cues.  					AI-generated summary 				 Designing user interfaces (UIs) is a critical step when launching products, building portfolios, or personalizing projects, yet end users without design expertise often struggle to articulate their intent and to trust design choices. Existing example-based tools either promote broad exploration, which can cause overwhelm and design drift, or require adapting a single example, risking design fixation. We present UI Remix, an interactive system that supports mobile UI design through an example-driven design workflow. Powered by a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MMRAG) model, UI Remix enables iterative search, selection, and adaptation of examples at both the global (whole interface) and local (component) level. To foster trust, it presents source transparency cues such as ratings, download counts, and developer information. In an empirical study with 24 end users, UI Remix significantly improved participants' ability to achieve their design goals, facilitated effective iteration, and encouraged exploration of alternative designs. Participants also reported that source transparency cues enhanced their confidence in adapting examples. Our findings suggest new directions for AI-assisted, example-driven systems that empower end users to design with greater control, trust, and openness to exploration.

Deep search agents trained on synthetic question-answer pairs generated through an iterative agent-based pipeline demonstrate improved performance and adaptability across different search environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep search agents, which aim to answer complex questions requiring reasoning across multiple documents, can significantly speed up the information-seeking process. Collecting human annotations for this application is prohibitively expensive due to long and complex exploration trajectories. We propose an agentic pipeline that automatically generates high quality, difficulty-controlled deep search question-answer pairs for a given corpus and a target difficulty level. Our pipeline, SAGE, consists of a data generator which proposes QA pairs and a search agent which attempts to solve the generated question and provide execution feedback for the data generator. The two components interact over multiple rounds to iteratively refine the question-answer pairs until they satisfy the target difficulty level. Our intrinsic evaluation shows SAGE generates questions that require diverse reasoning strategies, while significantly increases the correctness and difficulty of the generated data. Our extrinsic evaluation demonstrates up to 23% relative performance gain on popular deep search benchmarks by training deep search agents with our synthetic data. Additional experiments show that agents trained on our data can adapt from fixed-corpus retrieval to Google Search at inference time, without further training.

An agentic framework using entity scene graphs enables long-horizon video understanding with structured search, temporal reasoning, and cross-modal capabilities for extended visual and audio interpretation.  					AI-generated summary 				 The advent of always-on personal AI assistants, enabled by all-day wearable devices such as smart glasses, demands a new level of contextual understanding, one that goes beyond short, isolated events to encompass the continuous, longitudinal stream of egocentric video. Achieving this vision requires advances in long-horizon video understanding, where systems must interpret and recall visual and audio information spanning days or even weeks. Existing methods, including large language models and retrieval-augmented generation, are constrained by limited context windows and lack the ability to perform compositional, multi-hop reasoning over very long video streams. In this work, we address these challenges through EGAgent, an enhanced agentic framework centered on entity scene graphs, which represent people, places, objects, and their relationships over time. Our system equips a planning agent with tools for structured search and reasoning over these graphs, as well as hybrid visual and audio search capabilities, enabling detailed, cross-modal, and temporally coherent reasoning. Experiments on the EgoLifeQA and Video-MME (Long) datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on EgoLifeQA (57.5%) and competitive performance on Video-MME (Long) (74.1%) for complex longitudinal video understanding tasks.

  "desc": "Статья описывает EGAgent — агентивный фреймворк для понимания видео на протяжении длительных периодов времени, основанный на графах сцен сущностей, которые отслеживают людей, места и объекты во времени. Система использует структурированный поиск и рассуждение над этими графами, а также гибридные возможности визуального и аудио поиска для обеспечения многошагового вывода. В отличие от существующих методов с ограниченным окном контекста, предложенный подход позволяет проводить композиционное рассуждение над видеопотоками продолжительностью дни или недели. На наборах данных EgoLifeQA и Video-MME (Long) система достигает передовых результатов, демонстрируя эффективность для сложных задач понимания долгосрочного видеоконтента.",
