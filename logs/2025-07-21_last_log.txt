Top-left: We learn efficient Matryoshka-style [Kusupati et al., 2022] visual representations using multi-head clustering projection head. The encoder produces features Rd, which is sliced into progressively smaller subsets of dimensions d, . . . d/8, d/16. Each slice passes through projection head and corresponding clustering head with cluster counts c, . . . , c/8, c/16, inducing coarse-to-fine hierarchy of semantic abstraction. Top-right: Unlike prior approaches trained on curated academic datasets, e.g., LVD-142M in DINOv2 or proprietary data like WebLI in SigLIPv2, Franca is trained on open-source internet-scale uncurated data. Bottom: Despite this, it generalizes well across model scales and achieves strong performance on diverse downstream tasks, including in-context learning [Balazevic et al., 2023], out-of-distribution detection [Yang et al., 2022], and 3D understanding [Chen et al., 2025]. equal contribution.

Franca, an open-source vision foundation model, achieves high performance using a transparent training pipeline and novel clustering and disentanglement techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source (data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2, CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size, enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks, demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for the broader AI community.
