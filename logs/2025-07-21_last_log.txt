[ 1 3 6 5 3 1 . 7 0 5 2 : r Abstract. This work is still in progress Russian speech synthesis presents distinctive challenges, including vowel reduction, consonant devoicing, variable stress patterns, homograph ambiguity, and unnatural intonation. This paper introduces Balalaika, novel dataset comprising more than 2,000 hours of studio-quality Russian speech with comprehensive textual annotations, including punctuation and stress markings. Experimental results show that models trained on Balalaika significantly outperform those trained on existing datasets in both speech synthesis and enhancement tasks. We detail the dataset construction pipeline, annotation methodology, and results of comparative evaluations. Version notice (5 May 2025). This preprint is an earlier version of our work and is provided solely to solicit feedback from the community. revised manuscript has been submitted to an anonymous review venue and will be released after the end of the review period in accordance with conference policies. The code in the repository may differ from the current preprint version. Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis have advanced dramatically in recent years, enabling machines to produce intelligible and naturalsounding speech from written text. These systems are now widely used in applications such as virtual assistants, audio books and accessibility tools. In addition to TTS, generative models are also used in speech denoising, enhancement, and restoration, where they improve the intelligibility and quality of audio by reducing background noise or reconstructing missing segments. Together, these technologies are cha"

CSD-VAR, a Visual Autoregressive Modeling approach, enhances content-style decomposition by introducing scale-aware optimization, SVD-based rectification, and augmented K-V memory, outperforming diffusion models in content preservation and stylization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

"Balalaika, a large Russian speech dataset with detailed annotations, improves performance in speech synthesis and enhancement tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Russian speech synthesis presents distinctive challenges, including vowel reduction, consonant devoicing, variable stress patterns, homograph ambiguity, and unnatural intonation. This paper introduces Balalaika, a novel dataset comprising more than 2,000 hours of studio-quality Russian speech with comprehensive textual annotations, including punctuation and stress markings. Experimental results show that models trained on Balalaika significantly outperform those trained on existing datasets in both speech synthesis and enhancement tasks. We detail the dataset construction pipeline, annotation methodology, and results of comparative evaluations."
