[19.02.2026 01:22] Abstract 24. HybridRAG-Bench evaluates retrieval-intensive multi-hop reasoning in large language models by combining unstructured text and structured knowledge graphs from recent scientific literature, providing a contamination-aware benchmark that distinguishes genuine retrieval and reasoning from parametric re...
