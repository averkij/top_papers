Text:"MAEB: Massive Audio Embedding Benchmark Adnan El Assadi 1 Isaac Chung 2 Chenghao Xiao 3 Roman Solomatin 4 5 Animesh Jha 6 Rahul Chand 6 Silky Singh 6 Kaitlyn Wang 6 Ali Sartaz Khan 6 Marc Moussa Nasser 6 Sufen Fong 6 Pengfei He 6 Alan Xiao 6 Ayush Sunil Munot 7 Aditya Shrivastava 8 Artem Gazizov 9 Niklas Muennighoff 6 Kenneth EnevoldsenWe introduce the Massive Audio Embedding Benchmark (MAEB), large-scale benchmark covering 30 tasks across speech, music, environmental sounds, and cross-modal audio-text reasoning in 100+ languages. We evaluate 50+ models and find that no single model dominates across all tasks: contrastive audio-text models excel at environmental sound classification (e.g., ESC50) but score near random on multilingual speech tasks (e.g., SIB-FLEURS), while speech-pretrained models show the opposite pattern. Clustering remains challenging for all models, with even the best-performing model achieving only modest results. We observe that models excelling on acoustic understanding often perform poorly on linguistic tasks, and vice versa. We also show that the performance of audio encoders on MAEB correlates highly with their performance when used in audio large language models. MAEB is derived from MAEB+, collection of 98 tasks. MAEB is designed to maintain task diversity while reducing evaluation cost, and it integrates into the MTEB ecosystem for unified evaluation across text, image, and audio modalities. We release MAEB and all 98 tasks along with code and leaderboard at https://github.com/ embeddings-benchmark/mteb. 6 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 8 0 0 6 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r 1. Introduction Audio and speech representations support diverse applications such as voice assistants and music recommendation systems.

Correspondence to: Adnan El Assadi <adnanelassadi@cmail.carleton.ca>. Preprint. February 19, 2026. 1 zero-shot classification, and audio-text retrieval. Existing audio benchmarks often focus on specific tasks (e.g., vocal sound classification (Gong et al., 2022)) or narrow domains (e.g., environmental sounds (Piczak, 2015)) while often ignoring others, limiting insight into how well embeddings transfer across different applications. Without unified evaluation framework, the field remains fragmented, making it difficult to compare models or track meaningful progress across the full landscape of audio tasks. Additionally, the absence of integrated development and maintenance infrastructure has led to stagnation in existing benchmarks, with many becoming outdated as the field rapidly evolves. We introduce the Massive Audio Embedding Benchmark (MAEB) to provide unified, comprehensive evaluation protocol to spur the fields advancement toward universal audio embedding models. Building on the success of MTEB (Muennighoff et al., 2023), MMTEB (Enevoldsen et al., 2025), and MIEB (Xiao et al., 2025b), which have unified and expanded evaluation of embedding models for text and image through continual development and community maintenance, we extend this proven framework to the audio domain. MAEB spans 30 audio tasks grouped into 7 categories. Aligning with MTEBs approach, we include Classification, Zero-shot Classification, Clustering, Pair Classification, Retrieval, and Reranking tasks adapted for audio data. Notably, we consider audio-specific aspects such as multilingual audio understanding, long-form audio processing, and cross-modal audio-text tasks that have been largely absent from prior audio benchmarks. Beyond traditional speech recognition tasks, we emphasize comprehensive audio understanding capabilities through: 1) Diverse acoustic domains, including speech, music, environmental sounds, and bioacoustics; 2) Cross-modal abilities, particularly in zeroshot settings leveraging text descriptions; 3) Complex recognition tasks requiring fine-grained audio understanding; 4) Multilingual audio processing across various languages and dialects. To ensure efficient evaluation and broader adoption, MAEB allows for evaluation of small audio-only model in 2 GPU hours while not compromising on coverage. We also MAEB: Massive Audio Embedding Benchmark Figure 1. overview of task types and example subtypes in MAEB+. Values in parentheses denote numbers for MAEB. provide MAEB(audio), 19-task audio-only subset for evaluating audio-only models, and MAEB+, our full unfiltered collection of 98 tasks. Additionally, we provide modular architecture that simplifies the addition of new audio models and datasets, ensuring that MAEB can evolve with the rapidly advancing field of audio representation learning. Our evaluation of 53 models reveals that no single model dominates across all audio domains; each excels in specific areas while underperforming in others. Preliminary evidence from four Audio LLMs suggests that MAEB encoder quality may correlate with downstream Audio LLM performance (R2 = 0.86, = 4; see Figure 3), validating the benchmarks relevance for multimodal audio understanding. To summarize, MAEB makes the following key contributions: 1. We provide the first comprehensive benchmark for audio embeddings that spans multiple domains, languages, and task types, 2. We establish baseline evaluations using representative set of 53 models, revealing strengths and weaknesses across different audio understanding capabilities, 3. We identify critical areas where current models struggle, particularly in multilingual contexts and crossmodal understanding, providing clear directions for future research, 4. We create flexible, extensible framework that enables the audio research community to standardize evaluation practices and track progress more effectively. 2. MAEB MAEB is fully integrated into the MTEB ecosystem (Muennighoff et al., 2023), extending its unified evaluation framework to the audio modality alongside text (Enevoldsen et al., 2025) and image (Xiao et al., 2025b) embeddings. This integration provides several advantages: (1) tried-and-tested implementations with standardized metrics and evaluation protocols validated across thousands of submissions; (2) extensibility through minimal interface that allows adding new models or tasks with minimal code changes; (3) reproducibility via versioned code and"

MAEB is a large-scale audio benchmark evaluating 50+ models across 30 tasks in speech, music, and environmental sounds, revealing diverse model strengths and establishing correlations with audio LLM performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce the Massive Audio Embedding Benchmark (MAEB), a large-scale benchmark covering 30 tasks across speech, music, environmental sounds, and cross-modal audio-text reasoning in 100+ languages. We evaluate 50+ models and find that no single model dominates across all tasks: contrastive audio-text models excel at environmental sound classification (e.g., ESC50) but score near random on multilingual speech tasks (e.g., SIB-FLEURS), while speech-pretrained models show the opposite pattern. Clustering remains challenging for all models, with even the best-performing model achieving only modest results. We observe that models excelling on acoustic understanding often perform poorly on linguistic tasks, and vice versa. We also show that the performance of audio encoders on MAEB correlates highly with their performance when used in audio large language models. MAEB is derived from MAEB+, a collection of 98 tasks. MAEB is designed to maintain task diversity while reducing evaluation cost, and it integrates into the MTEB ecosystem for unified evaluation across text, image, and audio modalities. We release MAEB and all 98 tasks along with code and a leaderboard at https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb.

Исследование показало, что ни одна модель не превосходит остальные во всех задачах: контрастивные аудио-текстовые модели хорошо работают на классификации шумов, но плохо на многоязычных речевых задачах, в то время как речевые модели демонстрируют противоположный результат. Авторы обнаружили сильную корреляцию между производительностью аудиоэнкодеров на MAEB и их эффективностью при использовании в больших языковых моделях для аудио. Бенчмарк интегрирован в экосистему MTEB и содержит 98 задач с открытым лидербордом для единообразной оценки моделей обработки текста, изображений и аудио.",
