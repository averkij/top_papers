Text:"SLA2: Sparse-Linear Attention with Learnable Routing and QAT Jintao Zhang 1 Haoxu Wang 1 Kai Jiang 1 Kaiwen Zheng 1 Youhe Jiang 1 Ion Stoica 2 Jianfei Chen 1 Jun Zhu 1 Joseph E. Gonzalez 2 6 2 0 2 3 1 ] . [ 1 5 7 6 2 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aSparse-Linear Attention (SLA) combines sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion models and has shown strong performance in video generation. However, (i) SLA relies on heuristic split that assigns computations to the sparse or linear branch based on attention-weight magnitude, which can be suboptimal. Additionally, (ii) after formally analyzing the attention error in SLA, we identify mismatch between SLA and direct decomposition into sparse and linear attention. We propose SLA2, which introduces (I) learnable router that dynamically selects whether each attention computation should use sparse or linear attention, (II) more faithful and direct sparselinear attention formulation that uses learnable ratio to combine the sparse and linear attention branches, and (III) sparse + low-bit attention design, where low-bit attention is introduced via quantization-aware fine-tuning to reduce quantization error. Experiments show that on video diffusion models, SLA2 can achieve 97% attention sparsity and deliver an 18.6 attention speedup while preserving generation quality. 1. Introduction Trainable sparse attention methods (Zhang et al., 2025c;i; Wu et al., 2025; Zhan et al., 2025) have shown strong performance in diffusion models. They often achieve higher attention sparsity than training-free sparse attention methods (Zhang et al., 2025f; Xi et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025a). Among them, Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) (Zhang et al., 2025c) is promising approach that introduces linearattention branch to compensate for the sparse-attention branch, improving overall sparsity. SLA has been validated on both image and video diffusion models, such as TurboDiffusion (Zhang et al., 2025h). Motivation of SLA. SLA finds that, in diffusion models, 1Tsinghua University 2UC Berkeley. Preprint. 1 the attention map could be decomposed into high-sparse part P1 and low-rank part P2, and = P1 + P2. SLA can be formulated to = Ps + proj(Pl), where Ps and Pl are the attention maps of sparse and linear attention, and proj is trainable projection. Limitation of SLA and motivation of SLA2. (L1) Mismatch between SLA output and the original sparse-linear decomposition. After an analysis of the difference of the SLA formulation with the original SLA motivation, we find that the sparse attention map Ps of SLA differs from the decomposed sparse attention map P1 by constant scaling factor. Specifically, we find P1 = αPs, where α is ratio vector. To compensate for the mismatch, SLA introduces and trains an additional linear attention projection, which may fail to fully address it. We therefore aim to propose sparse-linear attention formulation that more directly matches the original motivation. (L2) Heuristic routing for sparse and linear attention branches. SLA does not optimally address the key design choice of how to split computation between the sparse and linear branches. In practice, SLA assigns attention associated with larger attention weights to the sparse branch and routes the remaining computation to the linear branch. This heuristic split is not optimal. For example, moving some weights from P1 to P2 via brute-force selection may not increase the rank of P2, while still improving the sparsity of P1. We therefore aim to design more principled split, guided by clear optimization objective. Finally, low-bit attention can be introduced to SLA to obtain an additional speedup. We thus aim to incorporate low-bit attention into SLA in way that introduces as little quantization error as possible, enabling further attention speedup. Our method. We propose SLA2, sparse-linear attention method that reformulates sparse linear attention to (1) better match the original motivation, and (2) optimally route between the sparse and linear attention branches. To address (L1), we directly learn the ratio α to combine the sparse and linear attention branches. This formulation aligns exactly with the sparse and linear components decomposition of attention. To address (L2), we formulate the approximation error of combining sparse attention and linear attention relative to full attention, and build learnable sparse-attention that supports gradient backpropagation. mask predictor SLA2: Sparse-Linear Attention with Learnable Routing and QAT We train this predictor by minimizing the formulated error. Furthermore, we build low-bit attention on top of sparse attention to achieve additional attention speedups. To reduce the error introduced by low-bit quantization, we integrate the quantization process into training in quantization-aware manner, enabling the model to better adapt to low-bit quantization and thus improve the accuracy of low-bit attention at inference time. Result. SLA2 achieves 97% attention sparsity and an attention runtime speedup on both Wan2.1-1.3B and 18.6 Wan2.1-14B. Please note that 97% sparsity corresponds to about 96.7% computation savings after accounting for the linear-attention branch in SLA2. In terms of video generation quality, even at 97% sparsity, SLA2 outperforms the baselines at 90% sparsity in end-to-end video quality, and it even exceeds full attention, which is 0% sparsity. Contribution. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We carefully analyze the limitations of SLA and propose SLA2, more reasonable sparse-linear attention method. SLA2 includes learnable router that splits computation between the sparse and linear attention branches, along with simple yet effective learnable combination for sparse and linear attention branches. For some insight on the design of SLA2, please see Sections 2.2 and 8. (2) We integrate quantization-aware training (QAT) into SLA2 to further accelerate attention without degrading endto-end video generation quality, demonstrating the effectiveness of QAT for low-bit attention. (3) Experiments show that SLA2 achieves 97% attention sparsity and an 18.6 attention runtime speedup on video diffusion models while maintaining video quality, surpassing baseline methods. 2.

[ 1 5 0 7 6 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Fig. 1: We build capability for humanoid to autonomously loco-manipulate novel objects in novel scenes using onboard sensors. We achieve this through modular system powered by large vision models for visual generalization and an accurate end-effector tracking policy. Our system achieves an 83 .8 % average success rate at reaching and picking up novel objects in novel scenes in the real world in challenging scenarios that involve whole-body control via bending, squatting, and twisting. AbstractVisual loco-manipulation of arbitrary objects in the wild with humanoid robots requires accurate end-effector (EE) control and generalizable understanding of the scene via visual inputs (e.g., RGB-D images). Existing approaches are based on real-world imitation learning and exhibit limited generalization due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale training datasets. This paper presents new paradigm, HERO, for object locomanipulation with humanoid robots that combines the strong generalization and open-vocabulary understanding of large vision models with strong control performance from simulated training. We achieve this by designing an accurate residual-aware EE tracking policy. This EE tracking policy combines classical robotics with machine learning. It uses a) inverse kinematics to convert Equal contributions. residual end-effector targets into reference trajectories, b) learned neural forward model for accurate forward kinematics, c) goal adjustment, and d) replanning. Together, these innovations help us cut down the end-effector tracking error by 3.2. We use this accurate end-effector tracker to build modular system for loco-manipulation, where we use open-vocabulary large vision models for strong visual generalization.

However, most existing benchmarks for multimodal foundation models (MFMs) emphasize environment-centric spatial relations (relations among objects in scene), while largely overlooking observer-centric relationships that require reasoning relative to agents viewpoint, pose, and motion. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs. It probes models observercentric understanding with six different awareness tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals human-model performance gap of 37.66%, even with the best-performing MFM, Gemini 3 Flash. Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors. We position SAW-Bench as benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, moving beyond passive observation to understanding physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics.

Text:"Correspondence to {rabanser, sayashk, arvindn}@princeton.edu Preprint as of February 19, 2026 Interactive dashboard available at https://hal.cs.princeton.edu/reliability Abstract AI agents are increasingly deployed to execute important tasks. While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail. 6 2 0 2 8 ] . [ 1 6 6 6 6 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Figure 1: Reliability gains lag behind capability progress. Overall reliability shows slow improvement over time.

Saurous1, Blaise Agüera Arcas1,2, João Sacramento1 and Alexander Meulemans1 1Google, Paradigms of Intelligence Team, 2Santa Fe Institute, Equal contribution Achieving cooperation among self-interested agents remains fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between learningaware agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce strict separation between naive learners updating on fast timescales and meta-learners observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior workwhere vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shapingemerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponents in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors. 1.

It is the first model to use new parametric mesh representation, Momentum Human Rig (MHR), which decouples skeletal structure and surface shape. 3DB employs an encoderdecoder architecture and supports auxiliary prompts, including 2D keypoints and masks, enabling userguided inference similar to the SAM family of models. We derive high-quality annotations from multi-stage annotation pipeline that uses various combinations of manual keypoint annotation, differentiable optimization, multi-view geometry, and dense keypoint detection. Our data engine efficiently selects and processes data to ensure data diversity, collecting unusual poses and rare imaging conditions.

SLA2 improves sparse-linear attention in diffusion models by introducing a learnable router, direct attention formulation, and quantization-aware fine-tuning for enhanced efficiency and quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) combines sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion models and has shown strong performance in video generation. However, (i) SLA relies on a heuristic split that assigns computations to the sparse or linear branch based on attention-weight magnitude, which can be suboptimal. Additionally, (ii) after formally analyzing the attention error in SLA, we identify a mismatch between SLA and a direct decomposition into sparse and linear attention. We propose SLA2, which introduces (I) a learnable router that dynamically selects whether each attention computation should use sparse or linear attention, (II) a more faithful and direct sparse-linear attention formulation that uses a learnable ratio to combine the sparse and linear attention branches, and (III) a sparse + low-bit attention design, where low-bit attention is introduced via quantization-aware fine-tuning to reduce quantization error. Experiments show that on video diffusion models, SLA2 can achieve 97% attention sparsity and deliver an 18.6x attention speedup while preserving generation quality.

HERO enables humanoid robots to perform object manipulation in diverse real-world environments by combining accurate end-effector control with open-vocabulary vision models for generalizable scene understanding.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual loco-manipulation of arbitrary objects in the wild with humanoid robots requires accurate end-effector (EE) control and a generalizable understanding of the scene via visual inputs (e.g., RGB-D images). Existing approaches are based on real-world imitation learning and exhibit limited generalization due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale training datasets. This paper presents a new paradigm, HERO, for object loco-manipulation with humanoid robots that combines the strong generalization and open-vocabulary understanding of large vision models with strong control performance from simulated training. We achieve this by designing an accurate residual-aware EE tracking policy. This EE tracking policy combines classical robotics with machine learning. It uses a) inverse kinematics to convert residual end-effector targets into reference trajectories, b) a learned neural forward model for accurate forward kinematics, c) goal adjustment, and d) replanning. Together, these innovations help us cut down the end-effector tracking error by 3.2x. We use this accurate end-effector tracker to build a modular system for loco-manipulation, where we use open-vocabulary large vision models for strong visual generalization. Our system is able to operate in diverse real-world environments, from offices to coffee shops, where the robot is able to reliably manipulate various everyday objects (e.g., mugs, apples, toys) on surfaces ranging from 43cm to 92cm in height. Systematic modular and end-to-end tests in simulation and the real world demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design. We believe the advances in this paper can open up new ways of training humanoid robots to interact with daily objects.

SAW-Bench presents a new benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness in multimodal foundation models through real-world video datasets with human-annotated question-answer pairs, focusing on observer-centric spatial reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 A core aspect of human perception is situated awareness, the ability to relate ourselves to the surrounding physical environment and reason over possible actions in context. However, most existing benchmarks for multimodal foundation models (MFMs) emphasize environment-centric spatial relations (relations among objects in a scene), while largely overlooking observer-centric relationships that require reasoning relative to agent's viewpoint, pose, and motion. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), a novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs. It probes a model's observer-centric understanding with six different awareness tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 37.66%, even with the best-performing MFM, Gemini 3 Flash. Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer a coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors. We position SAW-Bench as a benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, moving beyond passive observation to understanding physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics.

"SAW-Bench presents a new benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness in multimodal foundation models through real-world video datasets with human-annotated question-answer pairs, focusing on observer-centric spatial reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 A core aspect of human perception is situated awareness, the ability to relate ourselves to the surrounding physical environment and reason over possible actions in context. However, most existing benchmarks for multimodal foundation models (MFMs) emphasize environment-centric spatial relations (relations among objects in a scene), while largely overlooking observer-centric relationships that require reasoning relative to agent's viewpoint, pose, and motion. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), a novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs. It probes a model's observer-centric understanding with six different awareness tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 37.66%, even with the best-performing MFM, Gemini 3 Flash. Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer a coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors.

DreamZero is a World Action Model that leverages video diffusion to enable better generalization of physical motions across novel environments and embodiments compared to vision-language-action models.  					AI-generated summary 				 State-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel at semantic generalization but struggle to generalize to unseen physical motions in novel environments. We introduce DreamZero, a World Action Model (WAM) built upon a pretrained video diffusion backbone. Unlike VLAs, WAMs learn physical dynamics by predicting future world states and actions, using video as a dense representation of how the world evolves. By jointly modeling video and action, DreamZero learns diverse skills effectively from heterogeneous robot data without relying on repetitive demonstrations. This results in over 2x improvement in generalization to new tasks and environments compared to state-of-the-art VLAs in real robot experiments. Crucially, through model and system optimizations, we enable a 14B autoregressive video diffusion model to perform real-time closed-loop control at 7Hz. Finally, we demonstrate two forms of cross-embodiment transfer: video-only demonstrations from other robots or humans yield a relative improvement of over 42% on unseen task performance with just 10-20 minutes of data. More surprisingly, DreamZero enables few-shot embodiment adaptation, transferring to a new embodiment with only 30 minutes of play data while retaining zero-shot generalization.

Traditional benchmark evaluations of AI agents fail to capture critical reliability issues, prompting the development of comprehensive metrics that assess consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety across multiple dimensions.  					AI-generated summary 				 AI agents are increasingly deployed to execute important tasks. While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail.

Multimodal Memory Agent (MMA) improves long-horizon agent performance by dynamically scoring memory reliability and handling visual biases in retrieval-augmented systems.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-horizon multimodal agents depend on external memory; however, similarity-based retrieval often surfaces stale, low-credibility, or conflicting items, which can trigger overconfident errors. We propose Multimodal Memory Agent (MMA), which assigns each retrieved memory item a dynamic reliability score by combining source credibility, temporal decay, and conflict-aware network consensus, and uses this signal to reweight evidence and abstain when support is insufficient. We also introduce MMA-Bench, a programmatically generated benchmark for belief dynamics with controlled speaker reliability and structured text-vision contradictions. Using this framework, we uncover the "Visual Placebo Effect", revealing how RAG-based agents inherit latent visual biases from foundation models. On FEVER, MMA matches baseline accuracy while reducing variance by 35.2% and improving selective utility; on LoCoMo, a safety-oriented configuration improves actionable accuracy and reduces wrong answers; on MMA-Bench, MMA reaches 41.18% Type-B accuracy in Vision mode, while the baseline collapses to 0.0% under the same protocol.

"Multimodal Memory Agent (MMA) improves long-horizon agent performance by dynamically scoring memory reliability and handling visual biases in retrieval-augmented systems.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-horizon multimodal agents depend on external memory; however, similarity-based retrieval often surfaces stale, low-credibility, or conflicting items, which can trigger overconfident errors. We propose Multimodal Memory Agent (MMA), which assigns each retrieved memory item a dynamic reliability score by combining source credibility, temporal decay, and conflict-aware network consensus, and uses this signal to reweight evidence and abstain when support is insufficient. We also introduce MMA-Bench, a programmatically generated benchmark for belief dynamics with controlled speaker reliability and structured text-vision contradictions. Using this framework, we uncover the "Visual Placebo Effect", revealing how RAG-based agents inherit latent visual biases from foundation models. On FEVER, MMA matches baseline accuracy while reducing variance by 35.2% and improving selective utility; on LoCoMo, a safety-oriented configuration improves actionable accuracy and reduces wrong answers; on MMA-Bench, MMA reaches 41.18% Type-B accuracy in Vision mode, while the baseline collapses to 0.0% under the same protocol.

Sequence models enable cooperative behavior emergence in multi-agent reinforcement learning through in-context learning without hardcoded assumptions or timescale separation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Achieving cooperation among self-interested agents remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between "learning-aware" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between "naive learners" updating on fast timescales and "meta-learners" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.

Ключевой механизм работает следующим образом: при обучении на разнообразном распределении противников агенты естественным образом развивают стратегии адаптации к поведению соперника прямо во время эпизода. Уязвимость к шантажу, возникающая из способности агентов адаптироваться в контексте, создаёт взаимное давление на агентов формировать обучение друг друга, что приводит к спонтанному возникновению кооперации.

A promptable 3D human mesh recovery model using a novel parametric representation and encoder-decoder architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization across diverse conditions.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce SAM 3D Body (3DB), a promptable model for single-image full-body 3D human mesh recovery (HMR) that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with strong generalization and consistent accuracy in diverse in-the-wild conditions. 3DB estimates the human pose of the body, feet, and hands. It is the first model to use a new parametric mesh representation, Momentum Human Rig (MHR), which decouples skeletal structure and surface shape. 3DB employs an encoder-decoder architecture and supports auxiliary prompts, including 2D keypoints and masks, enabling user-guided inference similar to the SAM family of models. We derive high-quality annotations from a multi-stage annotation pipeline that uses various combinations of manual keypoint annotation, differentiable optimization, multi-view geometry, and dense keypoint detection. Our data engine efficiently selects and processes data to ensure data diversity, collecting unusual poses and rare imaging conditions. We present a new evaluation dataset organized by pose and appearance categories, enabling nuanced analysis of model behavior. Our experiments demonstrate superior generalization and substantial improvements over prior methods in both qualitative user preference studies and traditional quantitative analysis. Both 3DB and MHR are open-source.
