Text:"Reinforced Fast Weights with Next-Sequence Prediction Hee Seung Hwang * Xindi Wu * Sanghyuk Chun Olga Russakovsky6 2 0 2 8 1 ] . [ 1 4 0 7 6 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aFast weight architectures offer promising alternative to attention-based transformers for longcontext modeling by maintaining constant memory overhead regardless of context length. However, their potential is limited by the next-token prediction (NTP) training paradigm. NTP optimizes single-token predictions and ignores semantic coherence across multiple tokens following prefix. Consequently, fast weight models, which dynamically update their parameters to store contextual information, learn suboptimal representations that fail to capture long-range dependencies. We introduce REFINE (Reinforced Fast weIghts with Next sEquence prediction), reinforcement learning framework that trains fast weight models under the next-sequence prediction (NSP) objective. REFINE selects informative token positions based on prediction entropy, generates multi-token rollouts, assigns selfsupervised sequence-level rewards, and optimizes the model with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). REFINE is applicable throughout the training lifecycle of pre-trained language models: mid-training, post-training, and test-time training. Our experiments on LaCT-760M and DeltaNet-1.3B demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning with NTP across needle-in-a-haystack retrieval, longcontext question answering, and diverse tasks in LongBench. REFINE provides an effective and versatile framework for improving long-context modeling in fast weight architectures. Our code is publicly available. *Equal contribution . Correspondence to: Hee Seung Hwang <hee.h@princeton.edu>. Figure 1. Comparison of standard NTP and REFINE. Standard NTP (top) computes cross-entropy loss at each token position, providing only token-level supervision to fast weight models. REFINE (bottom) provides sequence-level supervision by generating multi-token rollouts at high-entropy positions, assigning sequencelevel rewards from hidden states, and optimizing with RL. 1. Introduction Long-context modeling has become essential for large language models (LLMs). Tasks such as long-document understanding (Shaham et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2024), many-shot in-context learning (Agarwal et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024), and code generation (Liu et al., 2023; Nichols et al., 2024) require models to extract, store, and reuse information from contexts spanning thousands of tokens (Yen et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2024; 2025). While attention-based transformers demonstrate strong performance on these tasks, their computational and memory costs scale quadratically (Keles et al., 2023) with context length, creating fundamental bottleneck for both training and inference. Fast weight architectures offer promising alternative by addressing this scaling problem through structural changes to the transformer block. Models such as DeltaNet (Yang et al., 2024), GatedDeltaNet (Yang et al., 2025), and LaCT (Zhang et al., 2025) replace global attention with fixed-size memory that is dynamically updated as new tokens are processed, storing contextual information directly in model parameters 1 Reinforced Fast Weights with Next-Sequence Prediction  (Fig. 2)  . This design enables efficient inference with constant memory overhead regardless of context length (Tandon et al., 2025). Despite their architectural differences, fast weight models are typically pre-trained with the same next-token prediction (NTP) objective used for standard transformer LLMs (Sun et al., 2024; Behrouz et al., 2024; 2025a; Yang et al., 2024; 2025; Zhang et al., 2025). In this work, we argue that NTP is suboptimal objective for fast weight models. The NTP objective only has an immediate effect on the next token and disregards the quality of subsequent predictions that depend on the same internal state (Gloeckle et al., 2024). As result, NTPs token-level feedback encourages parameter updates that optimize only short-term likelihood, limiting the adaptive capacity of fast weights and model behavior over longer horizons. To better align the training objective with the intended function of fast weights as long-context memory, we propose the next-sequence prediction (NSP) objective as variation of NTP. NSP encourages model to predict semantically coherent sequence of future tokens conditioned on given prefix. This objective directly reflects whether the information stored in fast weights enables accurate continuation over multiple steps, providing more appropriate training signal for long-context adaptation compared to the standard NTP. However, training with NSP introduces two key challenges: (i) standard cross-entropy loss does not naturally extend to multi-token prediction without explicitly generating full continuations, and (ii) generating multiple tokens for every prefix is computationally prohibitive for long contexts. We address these challenges by formulating NSP as reinforcement learning (RL) problem: model is trained to maximize sequence-level rewards derived from its predictions. Our method focuses on informative regions of the context and optimizes for NSP using policy gradient updates. Empirically, we show that RL for NSP yields superior fast weight initialization and consistently outperforms pure supervised fine-tuning (SFT) under the NTP objective. We introduce Reinforced Fast Weights with Next Sequence Prediction (REFINE), phase-agnostic framework that can be applied in multiple stages of the language model training lifecycle (Tab. 1). We demonstrate the effectiveness of REFINE in three stages: (i) mid-training, where we reinforce fast weight models on pretraining-like corpora to improve long-context adaptation; (ii) post-training, where RL is integrated into task-specific training loops to refine fast weights under downstream supervision; and (iii) test-time training, where REFINE reinforces fast weights directly on the prompt without additional labels. Our experiments show that REFINE improves fast weight initialization in all three settings. For example, applying 2 Figure 2. Comparison of Standard Transformer and Fast Weight Models, adapted from Zhang et al. (2025). Fast weight models replace attention with fixed-size memory implemented as weight matrix (W ), and updated according to Eq. (1). REFINE on LaCT-760M notably improves the average performance on RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024) long-context QA tasks by 8."

REFINE is a reinforcement learning framework that improves fast weight models for long-context modeling by training under next-sequence prediction instead of next-token prediction, enhancing their ability to capture long-range dependencies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Fast weight architectures offer a promising alternative to attention-based transformers for long-context modeling by maintaining constant memory overhead regardless of context length. However, their potential is limited by the next-token prediction (NTP) training paradigm. NTP optimizes single-token predictions and ignores semantic coherence across multiple tokens following a prefix. Consequently, fast weight models, which dynamically update their parameters to store contextual information, learn suboptimal representations that fail to capture long-range dependencies. We introduce REFINE (Reinforced Fast weIghts with Next sEquence prediction), a reinforcement learning framework that trains fast weight models under the next-sequence prediction (NSP) objective. REFINE selects informative token positions based on prediction entropy, generates multi-token rollouts, assigns self-supervised sequence-level rewards, and optimizes the model with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). REFINE is applicable throughout the training lifecycle of pre-trained language models: mid-training, post-training, and test-time training. Our experiments on LaCT-760M and DeltaNet-1.3B demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning with NTP across needle-in-a-haystack retrieval, long-context question answering, and diverse tasks in LongBench. REFINE provides an effective and versatile framework for improving long-context modeling in fast weight architectures.

Вместо традиционной парадигмы предсказания следующего токена (NTP), метод использует предсказание следующей последовательности (NSP), что позволяет модели лучше захватывать долгосрочные зависимости между токенами. Фреймворк отбирает информативные позиции токенов на основе энтропии предсказаний, генерирует многотокенные развёртывания и оптимизирует модель с помощью групповой относительной оптимизации политики (GRPO). Экспериментальные результаты показывают, что REFINE значительно превосходит стандартную настройку с NTP на задачах поиска в длинных контекстах и вопросо-ответных системах.",
