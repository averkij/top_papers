Text:"Optimizing Few-Step Generation with Adaptive Matching Distillation Lichen Bai * 1 Zikai Zhou * 1 Shitong Shao 1 Wenliang Zhong 1 Shuo Yang 2 Shuo Chen 3 Bojun Chen 1 Zeke Xie 1 6 2 0 2 7 ] . [ 1 5 4 3 7 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is powerful acceleration paradigm, yet its stability is often compromised in Forbidden Zonesregions where the real teacher provides unreliable guidance while the fake teacher exerts insufficient repulsive force. In this work, we propose unified optimization framework that reinterprets prior art as implicit strategies to avoid these corrupted regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Matching Distillation (AMD), selfcorrecting mechanism that utilizes reward proxies to explicitly detect and escape Forbidden Zones. AMD dynamically prioritizes corrective gradients via structural signal decomposition and introduces Repulsive Landscape Sharpening to enforce steep energy barriers against failure mode collapse. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks (e.g., SDXL, Wan2.1) and rigorous benchmarks (e.g., VBench, GenEval) demonstrate that AMD significantly enhances sample fidelity and training robustness. For instance, AMD improves the HPSv2 score on SDXL from 30.64 to 31.25, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings validate that explicitly rectifying optimization trajectories within Forbidden Zones is essential for pushing the performance ceiling of few-step generative models. 1. Introduction Diffusion models (Song et al., 2020; Karras et al., 2022) have demonstrated remarkable success in visual generation, exhibiting remarkable capabilities in generating diverse, high-resolution images (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Podell et al., 2023) and videos (Wan et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025a).

"Adaptive Matching Distillation introduces a self-correcting mechanism to improve generative model training by detecting and escaping unstable regions in the optimization landscape.  					AI-generated summary 				 Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a powerful acceleration paradigm, yet its stability is often compromised in Forbidden Zone, regions where the real teacher provides unreliable guidance while the fake teacher exerts insufficient repulsive force. In this work, we propose a unified optimization framework that reinterprets prior art as implicit strategies to avoid these corrupted regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Matching Distillation (AMD), a self-correcting mechanism that utilizes reward proxies to explicitly detect and escape Forbidden Zones. AMD dynamically prioritizes corrective gradients via structural signal decomposition and introduces Repulsive Landscape Sharpening to enforce steep energy barriers against failure mode collapse. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks (e.g., SDXL, Wan2.1) and rigorous benchmarks (e.g., VBench, GenEval) demonstrate that AMD significantly enhances sample fidelity and training robustness. For instance, AMD improves the HPSv2 score on SDXL from 30.64 to 31.25, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings validate that explicitly rectifying optimization trajectories within Forbidden Zones is essential for pushing the performance ceiling of few-step generative models."

BiManiBench evaluates multimodal large language models on bimanual robotic tasks, revealing limitations in spatial grounding and control despite strong high-level reasoning capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced embodied AI, and using them to benchmark robotic intelligence has become a pivotal trend. However, existing frameworks remain predominantly confined to single-arm manipulation, failing to capture the spatio-temporal coordination required for bimanual tasks like lifting a heavy pot. To address this, we introduce BiManiBench, a hierarchical benchmark evaluating MLLMs across three tiers: fundamental spatial reasoning, high-level action planning, and low-level end-effector control. Our framework isolates unique bimanual challenges, such as arm reachability and kinematic constraints, thereby distinguishing perceptual hallucinations from planning failures. Analysis of over 30 state-of-the-art models reveals that despite high-level reasoning proficiency, MLLMs struggle with dual-arm spatial grounding and control, frequently resulting in mutual interference and sequencing errors. These findings suggest the current paradigm lacks a deep understanding of mutual kinematic constraints, highlighting the need for future research to focus on inter-arm collision-avoidance and fine-grained temporal sequencing.
