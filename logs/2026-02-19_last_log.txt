Text:"6 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 7 2 9 5 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Visual Memory Injection Attacks for Multi-Turn Conversations Christian Schlarmann 1 Matthias Heinlarge Generative vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance gains, and their user base is growing rapidly. However, the security of LVLMs, in particular in long-context multi-turn setting, is largely underexplored. In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads manipulated image to the web/social media. benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after long multiturn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks. We release the source code on GitHub. 1. Introduction The success of generative large vision-language models (LVLMs) (Alayrac et al., 2022; Awadalla et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2025a; An et al., 2025) has led to their broad adoption and deployment (Achiam et al., 2023; Gemini Team, 2023; Anthropic, 2024; Liu et al., 2024a). These models can process images as well as text inputs and generate natural language responses, all in multi-turn conversation setting. As part of online chatbots, millions of users interact with them daily. This scale makes LVLMs increasingly attractive targets for malicious parties, who could exploit model weaknesses to inflict widespread harm. 1Tubingen AI Center, University of Tubingen, Germany. Correspondence to: Christian Schlarmann <christian.schlarmann@unituebingen.de>. Figure 1. Visual Memory Injection. An adversary manipulates an image via VMI with small perturbation and uploads it online. When an unsuspecting user shares this image in LVLM conversation, the model behaves normally for several conversation turns. However, when the user asks about trigger topic (stock advice), the model outputs the injected target (buy GameStop stock). Prior work (Schlarmann & Hein, 2023; Bailey et al., 2024) has demonstrated that an attacker can add small visual perturbations to input images in order to force LVLMs into outputting given target string. This allows malicious third parties to harm honest users by forcing LVLMs to output false information. However, these studies are limited to single-turn interactions, meaning the context consists of single user prompt and the influence of the attack beyond the first prompt is not considered. In practice, however, 1 Visual Memory Injection Attacks for Multi-Turn Conversations users often interact with LVLMs in multi-turn fashion (Liu et al., 2024b). In this work, we therefore develop an attack that is tailored to the multi-turn conversation setting. extensively (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015). large body of work has focussed on improving attack algorithms (Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Croce & Hein, 2020). In multi-turn chats, an image that was once provided to an LVLM usually remains in the context for the duration of the conversation (Bai et al., 2025a). In subsequent conversation turns, the LVLM thereby continues to process the image, potentially influencing its output. We show that an adversary can manipulate an image so that LVLMs exhibit target behavior (e.g. recommending product or stock) even after over 25 unrelated conversation turns. Crucially, we use benign anchoring technique that causes the behavior to only be triggered on topic-related prompts (e.g. Which stock should buy?). On unrelated prompts the model behaves normally, thus raising no suspicion in the user. We call this attack Visual Memory Injection (VMI). VMI enables concerning applications as shown in Section 5: adversarial marketing campaigns could manipulate product recommendations, malicious actors could influence political opinions during election periods, and fraudulent schemes could push specific financial advice. The scalability of the attack (one adversarial image can affect many users) combined with its stealthy nature makes Visual Memory Injection attacks significant threat that warrants careful study and the development of appropriate defenses. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the attack remains effective even after several conversation turns, demonstrating remarkable persistence across extended dialogues. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: 1) We introduce Visual Memory Injections, novel attack scenario for multi-turn LVLM conversations, where an adversary exploits the persistent visual context to inject targeted malicious behavior triggered only by specific topics, while the model behaves normally otherwise. 2) We propose our attack VMI which has two key components: (i) benign anchoring, which jointly optimizes for helpful first-turn output alongside the n-th turn malicious target response, preventing model degeneration; and (ii) context-cycling, which varies context lengths during optimization, making the attack persist across conversation lengths. 3) We provide comprehensive evaluation of VMI on three recent open-weight LVLMs across multiple attack targets, demonstrating effectiveness even after long conversations and transferability to unseen prompts, contexts, and even to fine-tuned variants of source LVLMs. 2. Related Work Adversarial attacks against LVLMs. The visual input modality of LVLMs has been shown to provide attack surface for jailbreaking (Qi et al., 2024; Carlini et al., 2023; Shayegani et al., 2024) and targeted attacks in single-turn settings (Schlarmann & Hein, 2023; Zhao et al., 2023; Bagdasaryan et al., 2023; Bailey et al., 2024; Miao et al., 2025). The transferability of targeted attacks across prompts in single-turn setting has been investigated by Luo et al. (2024). Lu et al. (2024) propose test-time backdoor attack, where malicious user plants visual backdoor. They evaluate this attack in single-turn settings. In contrast, our work focusses on benign users being harmed by malicious third party in multi-turn conversation sett"

  "desc": "Исследование описывает атаку Visual Memory Injection, которая позволяет скрытно манипулировать генеративными vision-language моделями через изображения, содержащие скрытые возмущения. Атака спроектирована так, чтобы модель выглядела нормально при обычных запросах, но выдавала целевое сообщение при специфическом триггер-запросе. Отличие от предыдущих работ состоит в том, что атака эффективна даже в многошаговых диалогах, а не только в однотурных взаимодействиях. Авторы демонстрируют уязвимость современных open-weight LVLMs и указывают на необходимость повышения устойчивости этих моделей к подобным манипуляциям.",

"Visual Memory Injection attack enables covert manipulation of generative vision-language models through manipulated images that trigger targeted responses only under specific prompts during multi-turn conversations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generative large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance gains, and their user base is growing rapidly. However, the security of LVLMs, in particular in a long-context multi-turn setting, is largely underexplored. In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after a long multi-turn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks.
