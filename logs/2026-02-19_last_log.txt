We introduce RynnBrain, an open-source spatiotemporal foundation model for embodied intelligence. RynnBrain strengthens four core capabilities in unified framework: comprehensive egocentric understanding, diverse spatiotemporal localization, physically grounded reasoning, and physics-aware planning. The RynnBrain family comprises three foundation model scales (2B, 8B, and 30B-A3B MoE) and four post-trained variants tailored for downstream embodied tasks (i.e., RynnBrain-Nav, RynnBrain-Plan, and RynnBrain-VLA) or complex spatial reasoning tasks (i.e., RynnBrain-CoP). In terms of extensive evaluations on 20 embodied benchmarks and 8 general vision understanding benchmarks, our RynnBrain foundation models largely outperform existing embodied foundation models by significant margin.

Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality Nitay Calderon1,*, Eyal Ben-David2, Zorik Gekhman2, Eran Ofek2 and Gal Yona2 1Technion Israel Institute of Technology, 2Google Research, *Work done during an internship at Google Research. Standard factuality evaluations of LLMs treat all errors alike, obscuring whether failures arise from missing knowledge (empty shelves) or from limited access to encoded facts (lost keys). We propose behavioral framework that profiles factual knowledge at the level of facts rather than questions, characterizing each fact by whether it is encoded, and then by how accessible it is: cannot be recalled, can be directly recalled, or can only be recalled with inference-time computation (thinking). To support such profiling, we introduce WikiProfile, new benchmark constructed via an automated pipeline with prompted LLM grounded in web search. Across 4 million responses from 13 LLMs, we find that encoding is nearly saturated in frontier models on our benchmark, with GPT-5 and Gemini-3 encoding 9598% of facts. However, recall remains major bottleneck: many errors previously attributed to missing knowledge instead stem from failures to access it. These failures are systematic and disproportionately affect long-tail facts and reverse questions. Finally, we show that thinking improves recall and can recover substantial fraction of failures, indicating that future gains may rely less on scaling and more on methods that improve how models utilize what they already encode. 1. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amount of factual information in their parameters (Joshi et al., 2017; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019; Mallen et al., 2023; Petroni et al., 2019), yet factual errors remain persistent challenge (Haas et al., 2025; Ravichander et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2024a).

LLMs demonstrate near-complete factual encoding but struggle with retrieval accessibility, where errors stem from access limitations rather than knowledge gaps, with reasoning improving recall of encoded information.  					AI-generated summary 				 Standard factuality evaluations of LLMs treat all errors alike, obscuring whether failures arise from missing knowledge (empty shelves) or from limited access to encoded facts (lost keys). We propose a behavioral framework that profiles factual knowledge at the level of facts rather than questions, characterizing each fact by whether it is encoded, and then by how accessible it is: cannot be recalled, can be directly recalled, or can only be recalled with inference-time computation (thinking). To support such profiling, we introduce WikiProfile, a new benchmark constructed via an automated pipeline with a prompted LLM grounded in web search. Across 4 million responses from 13 LLMs, we find that encoding is nearly saturated in frontier models on our benchmark, with GPT-5 and Gemini-3 encoding 95--98% of facts. However, recall remains a major bottleneck: many errors previously attributed to missing knowledge instead stem from failures to access it. These failures are systematic and disproportionately affect long-tail facts and reverse questions. Finally, we show that thinking improves recall and can recover a substantial fraction of failures, indicating that future gains may rely less on scaling and more on methods that improve how models utilize what they already encode.

  "desc": "Исследование показывает, что современные LLM кодируют почти все факты (95-98%), но испытывают проблемы с их извлечением из памяти. Авторы предлагают поведенческую схему оценки, которая различает два типа ошибок: отсутствие знаний и недостаток доступа к закодированной информации. Они создали WikiProfile — новый бенчмарк с 4 миллионами ответов от 13 моделей LLM для профилирования фактов на уровне их закодированности и доступности. Выводы показывают, что улучшение вспоминания через цепочку рассуждений (reasoning) может восстановить значительную часть ошибок, что указывает на важность лучшего использования уже закодированных знаний вместо простого масштабирования моделей.",
