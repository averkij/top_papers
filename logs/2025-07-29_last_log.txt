A novel reinforcement learning approach for large language models addresses inefficiencies in handling ultra-long outputs, enhancing performance and training speed through segmentation and dynamic masking techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance reasoning capabilities through extended output sequences. However, traditional RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with 128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\% to 85.1\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\% to 61.9\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the community.

"A novel reinforcement learning approach for large language models addresses inefficiencies in handling ultra-long outputs, enhancing performance and training speed through segmentation and dynamic masking techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance reasoning capabilities through extended output sequences. However, traditional RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with 128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\% to 85.1\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\% to 61.9\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the community."

This survey reviews architectures and methods for self-evolving agents in continual learning environments, examining different components, adaptation stages, and design considerations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks, evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g., models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages (e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards, textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents, highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare, and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety, scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously, performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.

A system using LLM-based agents enhances gene expression analysis by integrating workflow reliability and autonomous adaptability to improve preprocessing and identification accuracy while uncovering biologically meaningful associations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry. GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack, thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the idiosyncrasies of genomic data.   On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F_1 of 60.48% for gene identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85% respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting for latent confounders.

ScenePainter framework uses a hierarchical graph structure to ensure semantically consistent 3D scene generation by addressing the semantic drift problem in successive view expansion.  					AI-generated summary 				 Perpetual 3D scene generation aims to produce long-range and coherent 3D view sequences, which is applicable for long-term video synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction. Existing methods follow a "navigate-and-imagine" fashion and rely on outpainting for successive view expansion. However, the generated view sequences suffer from semantic drift issue derived from the accumulated deviation of the outpainting module. To tackle this challenge, we propose ScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation, which aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of the current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be dynamically refined to enhance diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework overcomes the semantic drift issue and generates more consistent and immersive 3D view sequences.
