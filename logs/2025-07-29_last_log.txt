By capturing both the static configurations and dynamic changes over time, 4D spatial intelligence shall provide comprehensive representation and understanding of the spatial environments that integrate the threedimensional geometric structures with their temporal evolution. This field has attracted significant attention due to its wide range of applications in video games [1], movies [2], and immersive experiences (AR/VR) [3], [4], where highfidelity 4D scenes serve as the foundation for delivering realistic user experiences. Beyond these applications that primarily focus on the fundamental components of 4D spatial intelligence namely low-level cues such as depth, camera pose, point map, and 3D tracking, as well as scene composing elements and dynamics spatial intelligence also plays pivotal role in advancing embodied AI [5], [6], [7] and world models [8]. These latter domains place strong emphasis on the interactions among scene components and the physical plausibility of the reconstructed This study is supported by the Ministry of Education, Singapore, under its MOE AcRF Tier 2 (MOE-T2EP20221-0012, MOE-T2EP20223-0002), and under the RIE2020 Industry Alignment Fund Industry Collaboration Projects (IAF-ICP) Funding Initiative, as well as cash and in-kind contribution from the industry partner(s).

In recent years, techniques for reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence have seen rapid advancements. Several surveys [9], [10] have provided valuable perspectives from various angles and have highlighted persistent challenges in the field. For example, [11], [12], [13] reviewed the recent process in deep stereo matching to obtain the low-level scene information; [14], [15], [16] offered comprehensive overview of advances in 3D scene reconstruction, covering range of input modalities and diverse 3D representations; [9], [10] classified dynamic 4D scene reconstruction methods into categories based on their core architectural principles. However, the field has advanced considerably, driven by the emergence of novel 3D representations [17], [18], [19], high-quality video generation techniques [20], [21], [22] that provide richer input data, and more efficient models capable of delivering superior reconstruction quality. Despite these strides, additionally, none of the existing surveys thoroughly examines the different compositional levels of the dynamic 4D scenes, nor do they offer detailed analysis of their respective developments and open challenges. This would potentially lead to fragmented understanding that overlooks critical components. These gaps highlight the need for comprehensive, up-to-date survey that systematically categorizes 4D spatial intelligence into distinct levels, consolidates recent advancements, and maps the evolving landscape of 4D scene reconstruction. Driven by this urgent situation, we categorize the existing methods for reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence into five levels and provide structured overview of their respective advances: Level 1 reconstruction of low-level 3D cues. At Level 1, the system targets the reconstruction of fundamental 3D cues namely, depth, camera pose, point maps, and 3D tracking. These low-level cues define the 5 2 0 2 8 ] .

However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured, detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce ARC-Hunyuan-Videoa, multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding, and video reasoning.

Text:"SmallThinker: Family of Efficient Large Language Models Natively Trained for Local Deployment Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Zenergize AI Abstract While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, family of LLMs natively designednot adaptedfor the unique constraints of local devices: weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our innovation lies in deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints into design principles. First, We introduce two-level sparse structure combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4BA0.6B and SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-21BA3B-Instruct. 5 2"

Use by non-experts or without accurate word timings may result in suboptimal outputs, including vocal-accompaniment mismatches and artifacts. These issues can be mitigated with duration predictor. Abstract Diffusion and flow-matching models have revolutionized automatic text-to-audio generation in recent times. These models are increasingly capable of generating high quality and faithful audio outputs capturing to speech and acoustic events. However, there is still much room for improvement in creative audio generation that primarily involves music and songs. Recent open lyrics-to-song models, such as, DiffRhythm, ACE-Step, and LeVo, have set an acceptable standard in automatic song generation for recreational use. However, these models lack fine-grained word-level controllability often desired by musicians in their workflows. To the best of our knowledge, our flow-matching-based JAM is the first effort toward endowing word-level timing and duration control in song generation, allowing fine-grained vocal control. To enhance the quality of generated songs to better align with human preferences, we implement aesthetic alignment through Direct Preference Optimization, which iteratively refines the model using syn"

A survey organizes methods for reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations into five progressive levels, offering analysis and identifying future research directions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence.

A multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual signals for structured comprehension of real-world short videos improves video search, recommendation, and engagement.  					AI-generated summary 				 Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on platforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet. However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured, detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding, and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on H20 GPU.

RICE enhances region-level visual and OCR capabilities through a novel Region Transformer and cluster discrimination loss, achieving superior performance across dense prediction and perception tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Learning visual representations is foundational for a broad spectrum of downstream tasks. Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework, enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.

"RICE enhances region-level visual and OCR capabilities through a novel Region Transformer and cluster discrimination loss, achieving superior performance across dense prediction and perception tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Learning visual representations is foundational for a broad spectrum of downstream tasks. Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework, enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.

SmallThinker, designed for localdevices with limited resources, uses advanced architectural innovations to achieve high performance without requiring GPU hardware.  					AI-generated summary 				 While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices: weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-21BA3B-Instruct.

Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO) stabilizes policy updates in large language models by maximizing the geometric mean of token-level rewards, improving performance on mathematical and multimodal reasoning benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models by optimizing the arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. However, GRPO suffers from unstable policy updates when processing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards, which manifests as extreme importance sampling ratios during training, i.e., the ratio between the sampling probabilities assigned to a token by the current and old policies. In this work, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO), a stabilized variant of GRPO. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of importance sampling ratio. In addition, we provide comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis to justify the design and stability benefits of GMPO. Beyond improved stability, GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by an average of 4.1% on multiple mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmark, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva, and Geometry3K.

Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization (ARPO) is a novel RL algorithm that enhances multi-turn LLM-based agents by adaptive uncertainty management and advantage attribution, outperforming trajectory-level RL algorithms with reduced resource usage.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models' intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments.

Recent advancements in large multimodal models like GPT-4o have set a new standard for high-fidelity, instruction-guided image editing. However, the proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity. These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in instruction-guided image editing.

A Foreground-Centric Network for document image rectification improves state-of-the-art by effectively handling foreground elements and layout distortions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide essential geometric references and layout information for document image correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet) to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the proposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and table borders.

"A Foreground-Centric Network for document image rectification improves state-of-the-art by effectively handling foreground elements and layout distortions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide essential geometric references and layout information for document image correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet) to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the proposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and table borders. The resources for further comparison are provided at https://github.com/caipeng328/ForCenNet."

Music Arena provides a scalable, interactive platform for evaluating text-to-music models through user-generated preferences and detailed feedback.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Music Arena, an open platform for scalable human preference evaluation of text-to-music (TTM) models. Soliciting human preferences via listening studies is the gold standard for evaluation in TTM, but these studies are expensive to conduct and difficult to compare, as study protocols may differ across systems. Moreover, human preferences might help researchers align their TTM systems or improve automatic evaluation metrics, but an open and renewable source of preferences does not currently exist. We aim to fill these gaps by offering *live* evaluation for TTM. In Music Arena, real-world users input text prompts of their choosing and compare outputs from two TTM systems, and their preferences are used to compile a leaderboard. While Music Arena follows recent evaluation trends in other AI domains, we also design it with key features tailored to music: an LLM-based routing system to navigate the heterogeneous type signatures of TTM systems, and the collection of *detailed* preferences including listening data and natural language feedback. We also propose a rolling data release policy with user privacy guarantees, providing a renewable source of preference data and increasing platform transparency. Through its standardized evaluation protocol, transparent data access policies, and music-specific features, Music Arena not only addresses key challenges in the TTM ecosystem but also demonstrates how live evaluation can be thoughtfully adapted to unique characteristics of specific AI domains.

A flow-matching-based model enhances lyrics-to-song generation by providing word-level control over vocal timing and duration, improving quality through aesthetic alignment and surpassing current models in music-specific attributes.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion and flow-matching models have revolutionized automatic text-to-audio generation in recent times. These models are increasingly capable of generating high quality and faithful audio outputs capturing to speech and acoustic events. However, there is still much room for improvement in creative audio generation that primarily involves music and songs. Recent open lyrics-to-song models, such as, DiffRhythm, ACE-Step, and LeVo, have set an acceptable standard in automatic song generation for recreational use. However, these models lack fine-grained word-level controllability often desired by musicians in their workflows. To the best of our knowledge, our flow-matching-based JAM is the first effort toward endowing word-level timing and duration control in song generation, allowing fine-grained vocal control. To enhance the quality of generated songs to better align with human preferences, we implement aesthetic alignment through Direct Preference Optimization, which iteratively refines the model using a synthetic dataset, eliminating the need or manual data annotations. Furthermore, we aim to standardize the evaluation of such lyrics-to-song models through our public evaluation dataset JAME. We show that JAM outperforms the existing models in terms of the music-specific attributes.
