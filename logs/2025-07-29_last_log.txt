Text:"Diversity-Enhanced Reasoning for Subjective Questions Yumeng Wang* Zhiyuan Fan Jiayu Liu Yi R. (May) Fungywanglu@connect.ust.hk yrfung@cse.ust.hk 5 2 0 2 7 2 ] . [ 1 7 8 1 0 2 . 7 0 5 2 : r aLarge reasoning models (LRM) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities have shown strong performance on objective tasks, such as math reasoning and coding. However, their effectiveness on subjective questions that may have different responses from different perspectives is still limited by tendency towards homogeneous reasoning, introduced by the reliance on single ground truth in supervised fine-tuning and verifiable reward in reinforcement learning. Motivated by the finding that increasing role perspectives consistently improves performance, we propose MultiRoleR1, diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives, to improve the accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks. MultiRole-R1 features an unsupervised data construction pipeline that generates reasoning chains that incorporate diverse role perspectives. We further employ reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward shaping, by taking diversity as reward signal in addition to the verifiable reward. With specially designed reward functions, we successfully promote perspective diversity and lexical diversity, uncovering positive relation between reasoning diversity and accuracy. Our experiment on six benchmarks demonstrates MultiRole-R1s effectiveness and generalizability in enhancing both subjective and objective reasoning, showcasing the potential of diversity-enhanced training in LRMs.Advances in OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 style models (Jaech et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) with long reasoning chains (Wei et al., 2023) have significantly enhanced the models capability *Equal contribution. Project leader of student team. Corresponding author 1The code and data of this work is available at https://github.com/toward-agi/diverse-o1.git. Figure 1: subjective reasoning task example which demonstrates that the perpective shifts may lead to different answers. We illustrate that diverse perspective thinking benefits subjective question answering. in various reasoning tasks (Yu et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2024b). Extended reasoning chains enable models to systematically divide and conquer complex problems, iteratively refining intermediate results, and methodically verifying the outputs. The DeepSeek R1 style models reached performance comparable to human experts in many objective reasoning tasks such as math (Cobbe et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2025a; Guo et al., 2025) and coding (Jain et al., 2024). This success highlights that scaling up the test time computation can significantly boost performance on complex, structured tasks relative to standard single-step prompting (Jaech et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2023). Beyond objective tasks with single correct answer, there is growing interest in applying Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to subjective or openended problems (Sarıtas et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2024). This homogenization stems from standard training pipelines which reduce subjective problems to single ground truth for both supervised learning and reinforcement learning, thereby penalizing diverse perspectives. As illustrated in Figure 1, due to the single inherent thinking process of LRM, the model tends to rely on homogeneous reasoning trajectories without exploring alternative perspectives, hindering their capacity to incorporate diverse reasoning strategies. Prior works solutions mainly fall into two categories: (1) Research on multi-agent debates has demonstrated that incorporating diverse role perspectives substantially improves performance on subjective tasks (Aoyagui et al., 2025; Cheng et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025b), but these methods require multiple interacting models; (2) some approaches ensemble solutions from varied decoding paths (Wang et al., 2023), yet the stochastic nature of these paths may not necessarily introduce broader range of perspectives (Naik et al., 2024). To address this gap, we propose to enhance the diversity of the DeepSeek R1 style reasoning chain, by dynamically integrating diverse role perspectives for subjective question answering, including tasks such as moral dilemmas, opinion-based questions, ambiguous question answering, and so on. To begin with, we conduct pilot study to confirm two key factors: the effectiveness of long reasoning chains in subjective reasoning tasks, and the impact of varying the number of role perspectives incorporated during reasoning. Our findings show that sequential test-time scaling performance improves as reasoning chains are lengthened, but begins to decline once they surpass an optimal length. Similarly, we identify that there exists an optimal range for the number of role perspectives in the reasoning chain. Building upon these insights, we propose novel framework MultiRole-R1 that enhances the diversity of long chains of thought. Specifically, we optimize the role perspective diversity and the reasoning diversity. MultiRole-R1 starts with novel data construction pipeline combining parallel scaling with sequential scaling to effectively incorporate broader array of role perspectives into the long reasoning chains. We subsequently refine the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), instructing the model to learn the multi-role reasoning format and enhance perspective diversity. Furthermore, to enhance the diversity of the reasoning process, we introduce carefully designed diversity reward function implemented through multi-role Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, taking diversity as an additional reward signal. By training on subjective questions only, MultiRoleR1 boosts the performance of both subjective and objective reasoning tasks. Our contribution can be summarized as follows: We perform pilot analysis that reveals the scaling law of reasoning length and role perspectives in subjective reasoning. We propose MultiRole-R1, training paradigm that incorporates unsupervised SFT data generation and GRPO with reward shaping, which effectively promotes perspective and lexical diversity. By training on subjective questions solely, MultiRole-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective reasoning benchmarks. Our experiments and analysis highlight an interesting phenomenon: optimizing for diversity often aligns with, and can even enhance, the accuracy objective. "

A diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives improves accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks through unsupervised data construction and reinforcement learning with reward shaping.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large reasoning models (LRM) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities have shown strong performance on objective tasks, such as math reasoning and coding. However, their effectiveness on subjective questions that may have different responses from different perspectives is still limited by a tendency towards homogeneous reasoning, introduced by the reliance on a single ground truth in supervised fine-tuning and verifiable reward in reinforcement learning. Motivated by the finding that increasing role perspectives consistently improves performance, we propose MultiRole-R1, a diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives, to improve the accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks. MultiRole-R1 features an unsupervised data construction pipeline that generates reasoning chains that incorporate diverse role perspectives. We further employ reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward shaping, by taking diversity as a reward signal in addition to the verifiable reward. With specially designed reward functions, we successfully promote perspective diversity and lexical diversity, uncovering a positive relation between reasoning diversity and accuracy. Our experiment on six benchmarks demonstrates MultiRole-R1's effectiveness and generalizability in enhancing both subjective and objective reasoning, showcasing the potential of diversity-enhanced training in LRMs.
