Text:"5 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 5 5 0 0 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r TaskCraft: Automated Generation of Agentic TasksFull author list in ContributionsAgentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation, limiting their scalability. We introduce TaskCraft, an automated workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present large-scale synthetic dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future research on agent tuning and evaluation. Date: June 13, 2025 Correspondence: zhouwangchunshu@oppo.com Code & Data: https://github.com/OPPO-PersonalAI/TaskCraftAgentic tasksautonomous, multi-step problem-solving requiring tool use and adaptive reasoningare increasingly pivotal in AI and NLP. Advances in language agents [6, 15, 26, 3840] have shifted AI from passive assistance to proactive agency, enabling complex workflow execution. This is exemplified by systems combining reasoning frameworks like ReAct [33] with dynamic orchestration, where solution trajectories critically improve inference quality. However, the inherent complexity of such tasks challenges conventional annotation paradigms, necessitating novel approaches to model training and evaluation. To assess advanced agent capabilities, benchmarks such as GAIA [8], BrowseComp [25], and Humanitys Last Exam (HLE) [9] have been introduced. GAIA evaluates reasoning, tool use, and web browsing through 466 real-world questions. BrowseComp comprises 1,266 tasks that test an agents ability to retrieve and integrate complex online information. HLE includes 2,500 multi-modal questions across over 100 disciplines to measure advanced reasoning and domain knowledge. While these datasets have significantly contributed to agent evaluation, they suffer from scalability limitations due to the labor-intensive nature of data annotation. For example, creating HLE required 1,000 experts to label just 2,500 data points, hindering its ability to scale. Prior work has explored the automatic generation of instruction-following data using large language models to alleviate the scalability issues of human-annotated datasets. representative example is the Self-Instruct framework [24], which demonstrated that LLMs can generate high-quality, diverse instruction data for multiturn dialogues. This approach has proven effective for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, these methods 1 are primarily designed for static instruction-following scenarios and fall short in modeling agentic tasks, which require interaction with external tools and environments. Consequently, such data is insufficient for training or evaluating agents that operate in dynamic, real-world settings. In this work, we introduce TaskCraft, an agentic workflow for the automated generation of agentic tasks. Our approach provides the following advantages: Scalability. The workflow supports adaptive difficulty, seamless multi-tool integration, and the generation of tasks beyond the capabilities of the task-generation agent, along with their corresponding trajectories. Efficient Verification. During each task extension, only incremental components undergo agentic validation, eliminating the need for full verification of the extended task. The core approach involves initially generating multiple atomic tasks, each solvable with single target tool invocation, and then expanding them using depth-based and width-based extension. For depth-based task extension, we iteratively transform specific textual elements of the original task (such as key terms) into new atomic task to support progressive resolution. In contrast, the width-based extension formulates tasks that require resolving multiple sub-problems by integrating distinct problem instances. To ensure high-quality agentic tasks, we employ rejection sampling strategy during verification. For atomic tasks, we include cases where an agent using external tools can solve the task while an LLM cannot, ensuring that atomic tasks genuinely necessitate tool usage. For extension tasks, we leverage linguistic analysis with LLMs, enabling rapid validation and facilitating the creation of challenges beyond existing agent capabilities. This approach enhances efficiency and broadens problem-solving potential. The controlled generation process ensures inherent access to ground-truth execution trajectories, enabling precise interpretability, reproducibility, and verifiabilitycritical for agent evaluation and reinforcement learning. To further validate task effectiveness, we implement self-evolving prompt optimization strategy inspired by bootstrap few-shot learning [5]. This iterative refinement improves rejection sampling pass rates while minimizing generation time. Additionally, we leverage the generated task trajectories to train an agent foundation model [4]. Experimental results show that an independent LLM, trained on these trajectories, effectively plans and invokes tools, yielding performance gains on HotpotQA [32], Musique [21], and Bamboogle [10]. Based on this method, we generated task dataset comprising approximately 36,000 tasks of varying difficulty, each requiring different tools for resolution, including search, web browsing, PDF reading, and image understanding. Our key contributions are as follows: We introduce an automated agentic task generation workflow capable of producing scalable difficulty, efficient verification, and multi-tool supported tasks, along with their corresponding execution trajectories. We empirically evaluate task effectiveness through prompt learning, which facilitates the self-evolution of our workflow and holds potential for optimizing existing agent workflows. Additionally, SFT is applied to an agent foundation model, enabling it to substitute agent workflows where applicable. We release synthetic dataset comprising about 32k agentic tasks of varying difficulty levels, complete with their execution trajectories, to faci"

Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for precise future prediction. While deep learning has achieved major success in time series forecasting, many existing approaches do not explicitly model the dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepEDM, framework that integrates nonlinear dynamical systems modeling with deep neural networks. Inspired by empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) and rooted in Takens theorem, DeepEDM presents novel deep model that learns latent space from time-delayed embeddings, and employs kernel regression to approximate the underlying dynamics, while leveraging efficient implementation of softmax attention and allowing for accurate prediction of future time steps. To evaluate our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments on synthetic data of nonlinear dynamical systems as well as real-world time series across domains. Our results show that DeepEDM is robust to input noise, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting accuracy. Our code is available at: https:// abrarmajeedi.github.io/deep_edm. 1. Introduction Time series forecasting is fundamental across multiple domains including economics, energy, transportation, and meteorology, where accurate predictions of future events guide critical decision-making. Deep learning has recently emerged as the dominant approach, driven by its ability to leverage large datasets and capture intricate nonlinearity. While deep models excel in prediction accuracy, they often 1Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin-Madison 2Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Copyright 2025 by the author(s). treat time series data as abstract patterns, and fall short in considering the underlying processes that generate them. Addressing this blind spot of deep models is important, because at its core, time series data is not merely sequences of numbers; rather, these data represent the dynamic behavior of complex systems, encoding the interplay of various factors over time. Indeed, many real-world time series data can be treated as manifestations of time-variant dynamics (Brunton et al., 2022). Therefore, understanding the underlying systems can unlock more effective forecasting strategies. Dynamical systems modeling characterizes the evolution of deterministic or stochastic processes governed by underlying dynamics, thereby offering an appealing solution for time series forecasting. However, if system is not specified, forecasting requires solving the challenging problem of inferring the underlying dynamics from observations. To address this, Empirical Dynamical Modeling (EDM) (Sugihara & May, 1990), data-driven approach built on Takens theorem (Takens, 1981b; Sauer et al., 1991), was developed to recover nonlinear system dynamics from partial observations of states. EDM leverages time-delayed embeddings to topologically reconstruct the systems state space from observed time series, which can then be used for forecasting. While EDM has demonstrated success in real-world applications (Ye et al., 2015; Sugihara et al., 2012), it assumes noise-free data, requires separate modeling for individual sequences, and imposes constraints over its forecasting horizon, significantly limiting its broader practical applicability. To bridge the gap, we propose novel framework DeepEDM that integrates EDM and deep learning, addressing EDMs key limitations and introducing new family of deep models for time series forecasting. Specifically, DeepEDM constructs time-delayed version of the input sequence, and projects them into learned latent space that is more robust to noise. It further employs kernel regression implemented using highly efficient softmax attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), followed by learned decoder, to model the latent dynamics and predict future values. Importantly, DeepEDM is fully differentiable, and thus can be learned end-to-end from large-scale data. DeepEDM connects traditional EDM and modern deep learning. On one hand, it significantly extends EDM by imLETS Forecast: Learning Embedology for Time Series Forecasting proving robustness against measurement noise, enabling the learning of single parametric model to generalize across sequences, and supporting longer forecasting horizons. On the other hand, it integrates the rigor of dynamical systems modeling with the flexibility and scalability of deep learning, leading to variant of Transformer model for time series forecasting, and providing theoretic insights for other Transformer-based models (Liu et al., 2024a; Nie et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2025). Our main contributions are thus three folds. First, we propose DeepEDM, novel framework inspired by dynamical systems modeling that leverages time-delayed embeddings for time series forecasting. Second, DeepEDM, grounded in Takens theorem, addresses key limitations of EDM, and sheds light on prior Transformer-based time series models. Third, extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and realworld benchmarks, demonstrate state-of-the-art forecasting performance of DeepEDM. 2. Related Work 2.1. Deep Learning for Times Series Forecasting There has been major progress in time series forecasting thanks to deep learning. Early approaches predominantly consider Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Yu et al., 2017), which are adept at capturing long-term dependencies. Subsequent developments, such as LSTNet (Lai et al., 2018) and DeepAR (Salinas et al., 2020), integrate recurrent and convolutional structures to enhance forecasting accuracy. Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) (Bai et al., 2018), and methods like MICN (Wang et al., 2023a) and TimesNet (Wu et al., 2023), leverage multi-scale information and adaptive receptive fields, improving multi-horizon forecasting capabilities. Recent works find that Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) can achieve competitive performance. Notably, TimeMixer (Wang et al., 2024a) presents sophisticated MLP-based archit"

TaskCraft automates the generation of scalable, multi-tool, and complex agentic tasks to enhance prompt optimization and fine-tuning of agentic models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation, limiting their scalability. We introduce TaskCraft, an automated workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future research on agent tuning and evaluation.

DeepEDM integrates empirical dynamic modeling with deep neural networks to learn latent spaces and approximate complex nonlinear dynamics for improved time series forecasting.  					AI-generated summary 				 Real-world time series are often governed by complex nonlinear dynamics. Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for precise future prediction. While deep learning has achieved major success in time series forecasting, many existing approaches do not explicitly model the dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepEDM, a framework that integrates nonlinear dynamical systems modeling with deep neural networks. Inspired by empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) and rooted in Takens' theorem, DeepEDM presents a novel deep model that learns a latent space from time-delayed embeddings, and employs kernel regression to approximate the underlying dynamics, while leveraging efficient implementation of softmax attention and allowing for accurate prediction of future time steps. To evaluate our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments on synthetic data of nonlinear dynamical systems as well as real-world time series across domains. Our results show that DeepEDM is robust to input noise, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting accuracy. Our code is available at: https://abrarmajeedi.github.io/deep_edm.

To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepEDM, a framework that integrates nonlinear dynamical systems modeling with deep neural networks. Inspired by empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) and rooted in Takens' theorem, DeepEDM presents a novel deep model that learns a latent space from time-delayed embeddings, and employs kernel regression to approximate the underlying dynamics, while leveraging efficient implementation of softmax attention and allowing for accurate prediction of future time steps. To evaluate our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments on synthetic data of nonlinear dynamical systems as well as real-world time series across domains. Our results show that DeepEDM is robust to input noise, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting accuracy. Our code is available at: https://abrarmajeedi.github.io/deep_edm."
