All rights reserved MiniMax-M1: Scaling Test-Time Compute Efficiently with Lightning Attention 1. Introduction Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 (OpenAI, 2024a) and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), have demonstrated remarkable success by extending the length of reasoning through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). In recent months, both the open-source community and commercial organizations have followed this trend, achieving significant advances on complex tasks such as Olympiad mathematics competitions and competitive programming (Anthropic, 2025; Google DeepMind, 2025; Hu et al., 2025; Kimi Team, 2025; Seed et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2025). The success of LRMs has been primarily attributed to new scaling dimension of test-time computeAs more FLOPs are dedicated to extended reasoning processes during generation, model performance shows consistent improvement, particularly for complex real-world applications (Jimenez et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2025). However, continuously extending the reasoning process is challenging within the traditional transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), due to the inherent quadratic computational complexity of the softmax attention mechanism. While previous works have proposed various techniques to mitigate this issuesuch as sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2025; Yuan et al., 2025; Zaheer et al., 2020), linear attention (Arora et al., 2024; Choromanski et al., 2021; Du et al., 2025; He et al., 2024; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2024b, 2021; Qin et al., 2021, 2022a,b, 2024a,c; Shen et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2025, 2023; Zhang et al., 2024), linear attention with delta decay (Peng et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024a,b), state space models (Dao and Gu, 2024; Glorioso et al., 2024; Gu and Dao, 2024; Gu et al., 2020, 2022, 2023; Gupta et al., 2022; Jamba Team, 2024; Ren et al., 2024), and linear RNNs (Behrouz et al., 2024; Chou et al., 2024; Chung and Ç, 2014; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Martin and Cundy, 2018; Peng et al., 2023, 2024a; Qin et al., 2023, 2024d; Siems et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2024; von Oswald et al., 2025)these approaches have not been fully validated in large-scale reasoning models, and nearly all competitive LRMs to date still rely on traditional attention designs. An exception is the Hunyuan-T1 model (Tencent AI Lab, 2025) that employs the Mamba architecture (Dao and Gu, 2024; Gu and Dao, 2024). However, this model is not open-sourced and few details are disclosed. In this work, we aim to build and open-source large reasoning model that can efficiently scale up test-time compute and compete with the state-of-the-art reasoning models. We introduce MiniMax-M1, reasoning model with hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and Lightning Attention (Qin et al., 2024b), an I/O-aware implementation of linear attention variant (Qin et al., 2022a). MiniMax-M1 is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 (MiniMax et al., 2025) model, and comprises 456 billion parameters in total, with 45.9 billion activations and 32 experts. In our attention design, transformer block with softmax attention follows every seven transnormer blocks (Qin et al., 2022a) with lightning attention. This design theoretically enables efficient scaling of reasoning lengths to hundreds of thousands of tokens, as illustrated in Figure 1 (Right). For example, compared to DeepSeek R1, M1 consumes less than 50% of the FLOPs at generation length of 64K tokens, and approximately 25% of the FLOPs at length of 100K tokens. This substantial reduction in computational cost makes M1 significantly more efficient during both inference and large-scale RL training. Furthermore, owing to its lightning attention mechanism and in line with MiniMax-Text-01, our M1 mode"

Text:"June 16, 2025 DeepResearch Bench: Comprehensive Benchmark for Deep Research Agents Mingxuan Du1, Benfeng Xu1,2, Chiwei Zhu1, Xiaorui Wang2, Zhendong Mao1 1University of Science and Technology of China, 2MetastoneTechnology, Beijing, China {dumingxuan, benfeng}@mail.ustc.edu.cn Deep Research Agents are prominent category of LLM-based agents. By autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into analyst-grade, citation-rich reportscompressing hours of manual desk research into minutes. However, comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present DeepResearch Bench, benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks, each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields. Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The first is reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate DRAs information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the development of practical LLMbased agents. 5 2 0 2 J 3 1 ] .

Text:"1 Discrete Diffusion in Large Language and Multimodal Models: Survey Runpeng Yu*, Qi Li*, Xinchao Wang National Univerisity of Singapore {r.yu, liqi}@u.nus.edu, xinchao@nus.edu.sg 5 2 0 2 6 ] . [ 1 9 5 7 3 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r AbstractIn this work, we provide systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, responseaware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, growing number of industrialscale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10 acceleration in inference speed. These developments position discrete diffusion models as promising alternative to intelligence based on the traditional autoregressive approach. The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. significant portion of these resources has been or can be transferred to support the development of dLLMs and dMLLMs. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Originally based on the continuous-space, the diffusion models for LLM and MLLM have transitioned to the currently prevalent discrete-space diffusion models built on absorbing states. The adaptation and simplification of the mathematical framework has played crucial role in enabling the scaling and engineering optimization of dLLMs and dMLLMs. T"

While there are methods capable of generating synthetic instructions at scale, they either suffer from limited grounding sources, leading to narrow distribution, or rely on trivial extensions that fail to produce meaningful trajectories in terms of complexity. In contrast, instructions that benefit efficient alignment are typically crafted with cognitive insights and grounded in real-world use cases. In this paper, we synthesize such instructions using attributed grounding, which involves 1) top-down attribution process that grounds selective set of real instructions to situated users, and 2) bottom-up synthesis process that leverages web documents to first generate situation, then meaningful instruction. This framework allows us to harvest diverse and complex instructions at scale, utilizing the vast range of web documents. Specifically, we construct dataset of 1 million instructions, called SYNTHQUESTIONS, and demonstrate that models trained on it achieve leading performance on several common benchmarks, with improvements that continually scale with more web corpora. Data, models and codes will be available at https://github.com/Ignoramus0817/SynthQuestions.

[ 1 9 8 1 2 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r aLarge Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday applications. As their influence grows, understanding their decisionmaking and underlying personality becomes essential. In this work, we interpret model personality using our proposed Supernova Event Dataset, novel dataset with diverse articles spanning biographies, historical events, news, and scientific discoveries. We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking key events from text, subjective and complex challenge that requires reasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small models like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and Open AI o3, and propose framework where another LLM acts as judge to infer each models personality based on its selection and classification of events. Our analysis shows distinct personality traits: for instance, Orca 2 demonstrates emotional reasoning focusing on interpersonal dynamics, while Qwen 2.5 displays more strategic, analytical style. When analyzing scientific discovery events, Claude Sonnet 3.7 emphasizes conceptual framing, Gemini 2.5 Pro prioritizes empirical validation, and o3 favors step-by-step causal reasoning. This analysis improves model interpretability, making them user-friendly for wide range of diverse applications. 1. Introduction As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integrated in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, finance, and *Equal contribution Institute 2Stanford University. Correspondence to: Pranav Agarwal Ioana Ciuca <ici- <pranav.agarwal.2109@gmail.com>, uca@stanford.edu>. 1Mila, Quebec AI education, evaluating their capabilities beyond factual accuracy becomes crucial. Most current LLM benchmarks focus on objective tasks with verifiable ground truths (Ivanov & Penchev, 2024), but these are becoming insufficient to capture subjective judgment, interpretation, and alignment with human values (Aoyagui et al., 2025). subjective task such as identifying and ranking critical events in detailed timeline of an event (for example, biography, historical and news events, or scientific discovery) is challenging (Stranisci et al., 2022; Plum et al., 2019). Selecting the most important critical event requires reasoning across different levels of abstraction and understanding long-term dependencies (Kourani et al., 2022). This is challenging due to human memory limitations and the non-linear interactions between events, which involve subtle causal relationships (Gianicolo et al., 2020). For the same event, humans can sample different critical events based on their values and experiences, often leading to disagreement. This task resembles the concept of salience detection in cognitive science, where information stands out due to both intrinsic properties and relevance to perceived goals (Liu In natural language processing (NLP) reet al., 2018). search, event salience has been explored through filtering non-salient events, leveraging contextual information, and examining how an events removal affects narrative coherence (Zhang et al., 2021; Otake et al., 2020). For LLMs, identifying the most critical events is especially challenging, as they lack the inherent understanding of events that humans possess (Belisle-Pipon, 2024; Ding & Wang, 2024). The ranking of these sampled events adds another layer of difficulty, as it requires complex reasoning, understanding causal relationships that are often not explicitly stated, and interpreting many subtle factors (Su et al., 2025; Cai et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025). Each LLM exhibits unique reasoning style shaped by its preand posttraining strategies (Besta et al., 2025; Kumar et al., 2025). Our dataset and task formulation make it possible to uncover human values and, in turn, personality traits reflected in each models analysis of critical events. Copyright 2025 by the author(s).1 Supernova Event Dataset: Interpreting Large Language Models Personality through Critical Event Analysis Figure 1. Overview of our LLM personality analysis framework. The framework utilizes our Supernova event dataset, collection of Wikipedia biographies, major news, historical events, and scientific discoveries from Google Deep Research. The target LLM receives an article from this corpus (via RAG) along with prompt, then samples and ranks the five most critical events in order of importance. judge LLM analyzes these selections and rankings to determine the target LLMs personality, revealing its human values and decision-making patterns. (We use personality to describe consistent behavioral patterns, not to imply consciousness or emotion) personality traits when explicitly prompted (Sorokovikova et al., 2024), our work demonstrates that even without roleplaying prompts, LLMs exhibit consistent style in their decision-making that reveals unique personality traits when handling complex subjective tasks such as critical event analysis. In this work, we introduce the Supernova Event Dataset, collection of primarily Wikipedia articles covering biographies, news, historical events, and scientific discoveries. These categories were chosen for their clear timelines and multiple key events. Using this dataset, we define task that involves sampling and ranking critical events from the given article. Another LLM is used as judge to assess the selected and ranked events to evaluate the personality of various Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). We also include an ablation study (Sec: 7) using movie script dataset to examine the behavior of the model in different domain. The main contributions of this work are: Supernova Event Dataset: We introduce new dataset consisting of Wikipedia articles on diverse topics, including biographies, news, historical events, and scientific discoveries from Google Deep Research. In addition to enabling personality interpretation, this dataset can help future research evaluate how well models handle long context, multi-dimensional causal chains, and counterfactual reasoning. New Task for Personality Benchmarking: novel task of critical event sampling and ranking is introduced to benchmark the personality traits of LLMs. This task is prompt-agnostic, which makes it effective in revealing c"

A hybrid-attention reasoning model called MiniMax-M1, featuring a Mixture-of-Experts architecture and lightning attention mechanism, is introduced for efficient long-input processing and reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce MiniMax-M1, the world's first open-weight, large-scale hybrid-attention reasoning model. MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention mechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model, which contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters activated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1 million tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning attention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time compute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that require processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including sandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to M1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel RL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling weights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants. Combining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on 512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just $534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K thinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate phase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our models are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the original DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex software engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks. We publicly release MiniMax-M1 at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M1.

"DeepResearch Bench offers a benchmark framework to evaluate the capabilities of Deep Research Agents in terms of research quality and information retrieval accuracy across multiple fields.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks, each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields. Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the development of practical LLM-based agents."

Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs) enable parallel generation and faster inference compared to autoregressive models through denoising-based strategies and full attention mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed.   The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025.   In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment.   Paper collection: https://github.com/LiQiiiii/DLLM-Survey

NoWait suppresses explicit self-reflection tokens during inference to enhance efficiency in multimodal reasoning without reducing model utility.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large reasoning models have enabled complex, step-by-step reasoning but often introduce significant overthinking, resulting in verbose and redundant outputs that hinder efficiency. In this study, we examine whether explicit self-reflection, signaled by tokens such as "Wait" and "Hmm", is necessary for advanced reasoning. We propose NoWait, a simple yet effective approach that disables explicit self-reflection by suppressing these tokens during inference. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks across textual, visual, and video reasoning tasks show that NoWait reduces chain-of-thought trajectory length by up to 27%-51% in five R1-style model series, without compromising model utility. NoWait thus offers a plug-and-play solution for efficient and utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

The paper presents a method for generating diverse and complex instruction data for large language models using attributed grounding, achieving top performance on benchmarks with a large synthesized dataset.  					AI-generated summary 				 The pursuit of diverse, complex, and large-scale instruction data is crucial for automatically aligning large language models (LLMs). While there are methods capable of generating synthetic instructions at scale, they either suffer from limited grounding sources, leading to a narrow distribution, or rely on trivial extensions that fail to produce meaningful trajectories in terms of complexity. In contrast, instructions that benefit efficient alignment are typically crafted with cognitive insights and grounded in real-world use cases. In this paper, we synthesize such instructions using attributed grounding, which involves 1) a top-down attribution process that grounds a selective set of real instructions to situated users, and 2) a bottom-up synthesis process that leverages web documents to first generate a situation, then a meaningful instruction. This framework allows us to harvest diverse and complex instructions at scale, utilizing the vast range of web documents. Specifically, we construct a dataset of 1 million instructions, called SynthQuestions, and demonstrate that models trained on it achieve leading performance on several common benchmarks, with improvements that continually scale with more web corpora. Data, models and codes will be available at https://github.com/Ignoramus0817/SynthQuestions.

"The paper presents a method for generating diverse and complex instruction data for large language models using attributed grounding, achieving top performance on benchmarks with a large synthesized dataset.  					AI-generated summary 				 The pursuit of diverse, complex, and large-scale instruction data is crucial for automatically aligning large language models (LLMs). While there are methods capable of generating synthetic instructions at scale, they either suffer from limited grounding sources, leading to a narrow distribution, or rely on trivial extensions that fail to produce meaningful trajectories in terms of complexity. In contrast, instructions that benefit efficient alignment are typically crafted with cognitive insights and grounded in real-world use cases. In this paper, we synthesize such instructions using attributed grounding, which involves 1) a top-down attribution process that grounds a selective set of real instructions to situated users, and 2) a bottom-up synthesis process that leverages web documents to first generate a situation, then a meaningful instruction. This framework allows us to harvest diverse and complex instructions at scale, utilizing the vast range of web documents. Specifically, we construct a dataset of 1 million instructions, called SynthQuestions, and demonstrate that models trained on it achieve leading performance on several common benchmarks, with improvements that continually scale with more web corpora.

BridgeVLA is a 3D vision-language-action model that projects 3D inputs to 2D images and uses 2D heatmaps for efficient and effective action prediction, outperforming baselines in various benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building vision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to effective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone, and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and output spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and effectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across three simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate from 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing baseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments, BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual disturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task, highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency.

Test3R, a test-time learning technique for 3D reconstruction, enhances geometric accuracy by optimizing network consistency using self-supervised learning on image triplets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Dense matching methods like DUSt3R regress pairwise pointmaps for 3D reconstruction. However, the reliance on pairwise prediction and the limited generalization capability inherently restrict the global geometric consistency. In this work, we introduce Test3R, a surprisingly simple test-time learning technique that significantly boosts geometric accuracy. Using image triplets (I_1,I_2,I_3), Test3R generates reconstructions from pairs (I_1,I_2) and (I_1,I_3). The core idea is to optimize the network at test time via a self-supervised objective: maximizing the geometric consistency between these two reconstructions relative to the common image I_1. This ensures the model produces cross-pair consistent outputs, regardless of the inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our technique significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on the 3D reconstruction and multi-view depth estimation tasks. Moreover, it is universally applicable and nearly cost-free, making it easily applied to other models and implemented with minimal test-time training overhead and parameter footprint.

PatchInstruct enhances LLM forecasting quality through specialized prompting methods that include time series decomposition, patch-based tokenization, and similarity-based neighbor augmentation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated new possibilities for accurate and efficient time series analysis, but prior work often required heavy fine-tuning and/or ignored inter-series correlations. In this work, we explore simple and flexible prompt-based strategies that enable LLMs to perform time series forecasting without extensive retraining or the use of a complex external architecture. Through the exploration of specialized prompting methods that leverage time series decomposition, patch-based tokenization, and similarity-based neighbor augmentation, we find that it is possible to enhance LLM forecasting quality while maintaining simplicity and requiring minimal preprocessing of data. To this end, we propose our own method, PatchInstruct, which enables LLMs to make precise and effective predictions.

A novel benchmark and dataset are proposed for multi-modal summarization of UI instructional videos, addressing the need for step-by-step executable instructions and key video frames.  					AI-generated summary 				 We study multi-modal summarization for instructional videos, whose goal is to provide users an efficient way to learn skills in the form of text instructions and key video frames. We observe that existing benchmarks focus on generic semantic-level video summarization, and are not suitable for providing step-by-step executable instructions and illustrations, both of which are crucial for instructional videos. We propose a novel benchmark for user interface (UI) instructional video summarization to fill the gap. We collect a dataset of 2,413 UI instructional videos, which spans over 167 hours. These videos are manually annotated for video segmentation, text summarization, and video summarization, which enable the comprehensive evaluations for concise and executable video summarization. We conduct extensive experiments on our collected MS4UI dataset, which suggest that state-of-the-art multi-modal summarization methods struggle on UI video summarization, and highlight the importance of new methods for UI instructional video summarization.

The study evaluates various LLMs on diverse text tasks using a new dataset, revealing distinct personality traits and improving model interpretability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday applications. As their influence grows, understanding their decision making and underlying personality becomes essential. In this work, we interpret model personality using our proposed Supernova Event Dataset, a novel dataset with diverse articles spanning biographies, historical events, news, and scientific discoveries. We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking key events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires reasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small models like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another LLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection and classification of events. Our analysis shows distinct personality traits: for instance, Orca 2 demonstrates emotional reasoning focusing on interpersonal dynamics, while Qwen 2.5 displays a more strategic, analytical style. When analyzing scientific discovery events, Claude Sonnet 3.7 emphasizes conceptual framing, Gemini 2.5 Pro prioritizes empirical validation, and o3 favors step-by-step causal reasoning. This analysis improves model interpretability, making them user-friendly for a wide range of diverse applications.
