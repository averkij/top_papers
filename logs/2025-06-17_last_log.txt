[ 1 1 7 5 2 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r Abstract In this paper, we introduce DoTA-RAG (Dynamic-of-Thought Aggregation RAG), Retrieval-Augmented Generation system optimized for high throughput, large-scale web knowledge indexes. Traditional RAG pipelines often suffer from high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG addresses these challenges with three-stage pipeline: query rewriting, dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and ranking. We further enhance retrieval by evaluating and selecting superior embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb10BT corpus. Moreover, we create diverse Q&A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana setup across broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency and achieves 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day. These results highlight DoTA-RAGs potential for practical deployment in domains requiring fast, reliable access to large and evolving knowledge sources.

Introduction 5 2 0 2 3 1 ] . [ 1 8 5 2 2 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r While the rapid proliferation of wearable cameras has raised significant concerns about egocentric video privacy, prior work has largely overlooked the unique privacy threats posed to the camera wearer. This work investigates the core question: How much privacy information about the camera wearer can be inferred from their firstperson view videos? We introduce EgoPrivacy, the first large-scale benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of privacy risks in egocentric vision. EgoPrivacy covers three types of privacy (demographic, individual, and situational) defining seven tasks that aim to recover private information ranging from fine-grained (e.g., wearers identity) to coarse-grained (e.g., age group). To further emphasize the privacy threats inherent to egocentric vision, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Attack, novel attack strategy that leverages egoto-exo retrieval from an external pool of exocentric videos to boost the effectiveness of demographic privacy attacks. An extensive comparison of the different attacks possible under all threat models is presented, showing that private information of the wearer is highly susceptible to leakage. For instance, our findings indicate that foundation models can effectively compromise wearer privacy even in zero-shot settings by recovering attributes such as identity, scene, gender, and race with 7080% accuracy.

An already popular concern is the privacy of people captured by egocentric cameras (Farringdon & Oni, 2000; Krishna et al., 2005; Mandal et al., 2014; Chakraborty et al., 2016; Templeman et al., 2014; Korayem et al., 2016; Dimiccoli et al., 2018; Hasan et al., 2017; Fergnani et al., 2016). This concern, however, is not specific to egocentric video. Thirdperson cameras are already common in public environments, e.g. surveillance networks, and many private environments, e.g. TV sets with user facing cameras, motivating line of research on privacy preserving cameras (Hinojosa et al., 2021; 2022; Cheng et al., 2024a; Khan et al., 2024) and post-hoc privacy techniques, e.g. methods to delete or obfuscate faces in images (Criminisi et al., 2003; 2004; Bitouk et al., 2008; Ren et al., 2018). While sharing all these issues, egocentric video introduces new set of privacy concerns of its own, namely the privacy implications for the camera wearers, which have been much less studied (Hoshen & Peleg, 2016; Thapar et al., 2020a;b; Tsutsui et al., 2021). Wearer-centric privacy is particularly concerning because egocentric videos are highly personal, captured continuously to document the day-to-day experience and surroundings of the camera wearer, and to keep track of their activities (Plizzari et al., 2024). The availability of this information will create pressures for its sharing, e.g. free video storage in exchange for video mining access, analysis by third parties, e.g. insurance companies collecting health information, and cross-referencing of egovideo with publicly available thirdperson video of the wearer, e.g. on social media platforms. All privacy problems currently posed by location-tracking apps will be magnified by the ability to know not only where people are but also what they are doing (Hoyle et al., 2014; Price et al., 2017; Speciale et al., 2019). All of this can lurk under false sense of privacy, due to the fact that the EgoPrivacy: What Your First-Person Camera Says About You? Figure 1. Overview of the proposed EgoPrivacy benchmark. What can you tell about the camera wearer from egocentric videos alone? It may come as surprise that fair amount of information about the user, such as demographics, identity, time and location of recording, can be inferred from their first-person view footages, despite not revealing their faces or full body. camera is not framing its user. Given the limited attention to the problem, it is currently not even well understood how much of privacy problem egocentric video poses to camera wearers. Questions such as what type of private information and how much of it can be recovered remain largely unanswered. an adversary with no additional data or information about the wearer, can simply use open source models to recover attributes like race and gender. Fine-tuning these models on annotated exocentric or egocentric datasets extends this ability to recover attributes like wearer identity or scene location. This work is first attempt to define the range of wearercentric privacy problems arising from egocentric recordings. In essence, we ask: What can be told about the camera wearer by watching egocentric videos? Figure 1 illustrates variety of personal information that can be inferred from the video: hand appearance and pose can give away the gender, race and age of the wearer; egocentric videos can be matched to exocentric views of the wearer to fully reveal identity or activities; background settings and objects can give away location and activity; video clips can be matched to reason about location and time, and so forth. We group these privacy issues into three broad categories: demographic privacy for recognizing demographic groups of the wearer, individual privacy for uniquely identifying the wearer, and situational privacy for recognizing when and where the recording took place.

DoTA-RAG improves retrieval and generation accuracy over massive web datasets using a dynamic routing pipeline and optimized embedding models, achieving high correctness scores while maintaining low latency.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we introduce DoTA-RAG (Dynamic-of-Thought Aggregation RAG), a retrieval-augmented generation system optimized for high-throughput, large-scale web knowledge indexes. Traditional RAG pipelines often suffer from high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG addresses these challenges with a three-stage pipeline: query rewriting, dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and ranking. We further enhance retrieval by evaluating and selecting a superior embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb-10BT corpus. Moreover, we create a diverse Q&A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana setup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves a 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day. These results highlight DoTA-RAG's potential for practical deployment in domains requiring fast, reliable access to large and evolving knowledge sources.

A novel methodology using large language models with curated prompts improves predictions of media outlet factuality and political bias, validated through experiments and error analysis.  					AI-generated summary 				 In an age characterized by the proliferation of mis- and disinformation online, it is critical to empower readers to understand the content they are reading. Important efforts in this direction rely on manual or automatic fact-checking, which can be challenging for emerging claims with limited information. Such scenarios can be handled by assessing the reliability and the political bias of the source of the claim, i.e., characterizing entire news outlets rather than individual claims or articles. This is an important but understudied research direction. While prior work has looked into linguistic and social contexts, we do not analyze individual articles or information in social media. Instead, we propose a novel methodology that emulates the criteria that professional fact-checkers use to assess the factuality and political bias of an entire outlet. Specifically, we design a variety of prompts based on these criteria and elicit responses from large language models (LLMs), which we aggregate to make predictions. In addition to demonstrating sizable improvements over strong baselines via extensive experiments with multiple LLMs, we provide an in-depth error analysis of the effect of media popularity and region on model performance. Further, we conduct an ablation study to highlight the key components of our dataset that contribute to these improvements. To facilitate future research, we released our dataset and code at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/llm-media-profiling.

EgoPrivacy evaluates privacy risks in egocentric vision through a large-scale benchmark, revealing that foundation models can infer private information about camera wearers with high accuracy in zero-shot settings.  					AI-generated summary 				 While the rapid proliferation of wearable cameras has raised significant concerns about egocentric video privacy, prior work has largely overlooked the unique privacy threats posed to the camera wearer. This work investigates the core question: How much privacy information about the camera wearer can be inferred from their first-person view videos? We introduce EgoPrivacy, the first large-scale benchmark for the comprehensive evaluation of privacy risks in egocentric vision. EgoPrivacy covers three types of privacy (demographic, individual, and situational), defining seven tasks that aim to recover private information ranging from fine-grained (e.g., wearer's identity) to coarse-grained (e.g., age group). To further emphasize the privacy threats inherent to egocentric vision, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Attack, a novel attack strategy that leverages ego-to-exo retrieval from an external pool of exocentric videos to boost the effectiveness of demographic privacy attacks. An extensive comparison of the different attacks possible under all threat models is presented, showing that private information of the wearer is highly susceptible to leakage. For instance, our findings indicate that foundation models can effectively compromise wearer privacy even in zero-shot settings by recovering attributes such as identity, scene, gender, and race with 70-80% accuracy. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/williamium3000/ego-privacy.
