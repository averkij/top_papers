Text:"PREPRINT 1 SeqPE: Transformer with Sequential Position Encoding Huyang Li, Yahui Liu, Hongyu Sun, Deng Cai, Leyang Cui, Wei Bi, Peilin Zhao, Taro Watanabe AbstractSince self-attention layers in Transformers are permutation invariant by design, positional encodings must be explicitly incorporated to enable spatial understanding. However, fixed-size lookup tables used in traditional learnable position embeddings (PEs) limit extrapolation capabilities beyond pre-trained sequence lengths. Expert-designed methods such as ALIBI and ROPE, mitigate this limitation but demand extensive modifications for adapting to new modalities, underscoring fundamental challenges in adaptability and scalability. In this work, we present SEQPE, unified and fully learnable position encoding framework that represents each n-dimensional position index as symbolic sequence and employs lightweight sequential position encoder to learn their embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To regularize SEQPEs embedding space, we introduce two complementary objectives: contrastive objective that aligns embedding distances with predefined position-distance function, and knowledge distillation loss that anchors out-of-distribution position embeddings to in-distribution teacher representations, further enhancing extrapolation performance. Experiments across language modeling, long-context question answering, and 2D image classification demonstrate that SeqPE not only surpasses strong baselines in perplexity, exact match (EM), and accuracyparticularly under context length extrapolationbut also enables seamless generalization to multi-dimensional inputs without requiring manual architectural redesign.

We release our code, data, and checkpoints at https://github.com/ghrua/seqpe. Index TermsTransformers, Position Encoding, Position Embeddings, Contrastive Learning, Multi-modalityT He Transformer model [46] has become the dominant framework for AI tasks across data with varied modalities, including text [3, 35], image [9, 43], and video [13]. However, the self-attention mechanism in Transformers is inherently permutation-invariant, lacking an intrinsic understanding of input token order, an aspect crucial for capturing the semantics of sequential data. To address this, position encoding is introduced to inject order-sensitive information into the models [12, 46], enabling Transformers to distinguish tokens based not only on their content but also on their position within the context. Recently, there has been extensive research exploration on position encoding, which can be broadly categorized into two main directions. In the first direction, fixed or learnable position embeddings (PEs) are provided through the use of fixed-size lookup tables [8, 9, 35, 36]. Such PEs are typically added to the input text or vision embeddings as the input to transformer models. However, due to training constraints imposed by fixed maximum sequence lengths, such PEs usually exhibit poor extrapolation capacity to sequence lengths that exceed the length encountered during training. In the second direction, positional information is injected by modifying attention scores with expert-designed weights or mapping functions [1, 19, 33, 42, 42, 44, 49]. key advantage of such methods is their ability to establish Huayang Li, Hongyu Sun and Taro Watanabe are with Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Nara, Japan.

Taro Watanabe and Yahui Liu are co-corresponding authors. E-mail: {li.huayang.lh6, taro}@is.naist.jp, yahui.cvrs@gmail.com consistent, predetermined positional relationship patterns, enabling models to extrapolate to previously unseen sequence positions. However, they also come with two crucial limitations: (1) They primarily model distance decay or local emphasis but may fail to capture more subtle, nonmonotonic or directional positional relationships that learnable embeddings could represent. (2) They use fixed, nonlearned functional form for the bias, and lack adaptability for different datasets, tasks [27, 53] or even different layers within the same model [16]. In this work, we propose an alternative scheme for learnable position encoding, called SEQPE, which employs sequential position encoder to directly map sequential representationderived from an n-dimensional position into hidden vector representing that position. Concretely, we represent the n-dimensional position using three types of embeddings: sequence tokens, sequence positions, and data dimensions. The embedded sequence is then encoded using lightweight encoder . An example of the position representation for 2D data is illustrated on the left-hand side of Figure 1. By adopting this sequential representation as the new interface, our learnable position encoding method can easily encode unseen positions, thereby overcoming the limitation of standard learnable position encoding methods, which can only handle fixed number of positions. Additionally, compared to PEs with expert-designed weights or mapping functions, our method offers superior adaptability to diverse tasks and enhanced extensibility to data across varying dimensionality. To guarantee the stability of performance, there is critical challenge needs to be addressed: sequential models often struggle to distinguish semantic differences between lexically 5 2 0 2 6 1 ] . [ 1 7 7 2 3 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r PREPRINT 2 Fig. 1: Overall architecture and objectives for SEQPE. We use the representation for the (2, 3) position in an image with 4 4 patches as an example, where SeqPE converts the (2, 3) position to left-padded sequence (0, 2, 0, 3) and learn its representation by sequential position encoder. The main purpose of the left-side padded 0 for each dimension is to ensure that digits with the same place value (e.g., units, tens) always occupy the same position in the sequence, resulting in more consistent representation and improved training efficiency. With the sequential interface of positions, SEQPE can be easily extended to positions of longer context and varied dimensions. Moreover, two regularization objectives, agnostic to data dimensionality, are introduced to regularize the position representation space of SEQPE. similar sequences [2, 23]. For example, while one might intuitively expect that closer positions would yield more similar representations"

TransDiff, combining an Autoregressive Transformer and diffusion models, achieves superior image generation performance and speed, while Multi-Reference Autoregression further enhances its quality and diversity.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore, building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open up a new frontier in the field of image generation.

"TransDiff, combining an Autoregressive Transformer and diffusion models, achieves superior image generation performance and speed, while Multi-Reference Autoregression further enhances its quality and diversity.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore, building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open up a new frontier in the field of image generation."

The research explores training strategies such as supervised fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, and reinforcement learning to enhance the performance of resource-efficient Small Reasoning Language Models with limited capacity.  					AI-generated summary 				 The ongoing evolution of language models has led to the development of large-scale architectures that demonstrate exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks. However, these models come with significant computational and energy demands, as well as potential privacy implications. In this context, Small Reasoning Language Models (SRLMs) with approximately 0.5 billion parameters present a compelling alternative due to their remarkable computational efficiency and cost effectiveness, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Despite these advantages, the limited capacity of 0.5 billion parameter models poses challenges in handling complex tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. This research investigates various training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), knowledge distillation (KD), and reinforcement learning (RL), as well as their hybrid implementations, to enhance the performance of 0.5B SRLMs. We analyze effective methodologies to bridge the performance gap between SRLMS and larger models and present insights into optimal training pipelines tailored for these smaller architectures. Through extensive experimental validation and analysis, our work aims to provide actionable recommendations for maximizing the reasoning capabilities of 0.5B models.

SeqPE, a fully learnable position encoding framework, enhances the adaptability and scalability of positional encodings in Transformers, improving performance in various tasks and seamless multi-dimensional generalization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Since self-attention layers in Transformers are permutation invariant by design, positional encodings must be explicitly incorporated to enable spatial understanding. However, fixed-size lookup tables used in traditional learnable position embeddings (PEs) limit extrapolation capabilities beyond pre-trained sequence lengths. Expert-designed methods such as ALiBi and RoPE, mitigate this limitation but demand extensive modifications for adapting to new modalities, underscoring fundamental challenges in adaptability and scalability. In this work, we present SeqPE, a unified and fully learnable position encoding framework that represents each n-dimensional position index as a symbolic sequence and employs a lightweight sequential position encoder to learn their embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To regularize SeqPE's embedding space, we introduce two complementary objectives: a contrastive objective that aligns embedding distances with a predefined position-distance function, and a knowledge distillation loss that anchors out-of-distribution position embeddings to in-distribution teacher representations, further enhancing extrapolation performance. Experiments across language modeling, long-context question answering, and 2D image classification demonstrate that SeqPE not only surpasses strong baselines in perplexity, exact match (EM), and accuracy--particularly under context length extrapolation--but also enables seamless generalization to multi-dimensional inputs without requiring manual architectural redesign. We release our code, data, and checkpoints at https://github.com/ghrua/seqpe.
