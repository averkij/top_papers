Text:"2025-06-13 AceReason-Nemotron 1.1: Advancing Math and Code Reasoning through SFT and RL Synergy Zihan Liu, Zhuolin Yang, Yang Chen, Chankyu Lee, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro, Wei PingIn this work, we investigate the synergy between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) in developing strong reasoning models. We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, setting that strikes good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe.

Introduction Math and code reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has been an active area of research for years (Chen et al., 2021; Cobbe et al., 2021). Previous work has primarily focused on enhancing short chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2022), which is typically acquired through pretraining and supervised finetuning (SFT) (e.g., Hui et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024). Since the introduction of OpenAI o1 (OpenAI, 2024) and DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024), long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which is acquired through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), has emerged as key driver of the remarkable progress in the reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs (Guo et al., 2025; Qwen-Team, 2025; Yang et al., 2025), with reward signals typically provided by rule-based verifiers. Subsequently, much of the follow-up work has focused on distilling these large frontier models into smaller or mid-sized models through synthetic data generation and SFT-only approach (Ahmad et al., 2025; Bercovich et al., 2025; Moshkov et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025). Several recent efforts have sought to replicate the success of large-scale RL on smaller base or SFT models (i.e., 7B and 14B ) (e.g., He et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2025; Wen et al., 2025), often leveraging DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen2.5 (Chen et al., 2025) as the initialization checkpoints. However, systematic study of the synergy between SFT and RL has been limited within the research community and is notably absent from the technical reports of frontier models. In our previous study (Chen et al., 2025), we demonstrated that AceReason-Nemotron-1.0-7B and 14B can outperform the leading math and code models built on Qwen2.5-Math 7B and 14B. In particular, the proposed stage-wise RL approach on math-only and code-only prompts has proven to be both effective and efficient. In this work, we take step further by integrating supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), probing their training dynamics and the synergy between them to provide holistic perspective on these post-training techniques for building state-of-the-art reasoning models. Specifically, we make the following contributions: 1. We begin by scaling SFT training through collecting large number of prompts, increasing the number of generated responses per prompt, and increasing the number of training epochs. We find that: (i) Scaling both the number of prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt leads to substantial improvements in reasoning performance on math and code benchmarks, although scaling the number of prompts yields more significant gains. (ii) We observe consistent performance gains from the first to the fifth epoch, with improvements plateauing between the fifth and sixth epochs, regardless of the specific SFT blend used. This suggests that certain degree of "overfitting" actually enhances test accuracy with long CoT generation, likely due to exposure bias in autoregressive models. 2. We initiate RL training from various SFT models and make the following key observations: (i) Stronger SFT models continue to produce consistently better results after large-scale RL, although the performance gap narrows during RL training. (ii) For given initial SFT model, selecting an appropriate temperature during RL training is crucial for achieving good balance between exploration and exploitation. We provide rule of thumb for setting the sampling temperature such that the temperature-adjusted entropy remains around 0.3, which typically leads to effecive RL training. 3. We systematically study the best strategy during RL training when the final answer is not produced within specific response length budget (e.g., 24K). Whether we sh"

Combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning enhances reasoning models, especially when optimizing sampling temperature and leveraging strong initial fine-tuning, as demonstrated by the improved AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 model.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this work, we investigate the synergy between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) in developing strong reasoning models. We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe. We release the model and data at: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/AceReason-Nemotron-1.1-7B

"Combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning enhances reasoning models, especially when optimizing sampling temperature and leveraging strong initial fine-tuning, as demonstrated by the improved AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 model.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this work, we investigate the synergy between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) in developing strong reasoning models. We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe. We release the model and data at: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/AceReason-Nemotron-1.1-7B"
