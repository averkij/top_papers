[ 1 0 3 4 3 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r Uncertainty-Aware Remaining Lifespan Prediction from Images Tristan Kenneweg1, Philip Kenneweg1, and Barbara Hammer1 University of Bielefeld Abstract. Predicting mortality-related outcomes from images offers the prospect of accessible, noninvasive, and scalable health screening. We present method that leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate remaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust uncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies systematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can be effectively modeled by learning Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.48 years on an established Dataset, and further improves to 4.79 and 5.07 years MAE on two new, higherquality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly, our models provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by bucketed expected calibration error of 0.62 years. While not intended for clinical deployment, these results highlight the potential of extracting medically relevant signals from images. We make all code and datasets available to facilitate further research. First, it is unclear how well this task can be solved in the informationtheoretic limit. If we had perfect predictor, what level of precision could we achieve? Intuitively, one might expect only low maximum precision, since not all information relevant for remaining life prediction is likely to be present in single image. However, this intuition is challenged by the related task of chronological age prediction. The mean absolute error in the MORPH Album 2 dataset, which provides facial images along with the age of each individual, is reported to be less than 2.5 years [1,2]. In contrast, using DNA methylation markers for the prediction of chronological age, the landmark 2013 paper [3] reported median erro"

Vision transformer models predict remaining lifespan from images with high accuracy and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.  					AI-generated summary 				 Predicting mortality-related outcomes from images offers the prospect of accessible, noninvasive, and scalable health screening. We present a method that leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate remaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust uncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies systematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can be effectively modeled by learning a Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.48 years on an established Dataset, and further improves to 4.79 and 5.07 years MAE on two new, higher-quality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly, our models provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by a bucketed expected calibration error of 0.62 years. While not intended for clinical deployment, these results highlight the potential of extracting medically relevant signals from images. We make all code and datasets available to facilitate further research.
