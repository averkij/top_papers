Text:"DANIEL COHEN-OR SNAP RESEARCH https://snap-research.github.io/dynamic_concepts 5 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 4 4 8 4 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r Fig. 1. We personalize video model to capture dynamic concepts entities defined not only by their appearance but also by their unique motion patterns, such as the fluid motion of ocean waves or the flickering dynamics of bonfire (left). This enables high-fidelity generation, editing, and the composition of these dynamic elements into single video, where they interact naturally (right). Personalizing generative text-to-image models has seen remarkable progress, but extending this personalization to text-to-video models presents unique challenges. Unlike static concepts, personalizing text-to-video models has the potential to capture dynamic concepts entities defined not only by their appearance but also by their motion. In this paper, we introduce Setand-Sequence, novel framework for personalizing Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)based generative video models with dynamic concepts. Our approach imposes spatio-temporal weight space within an architecture that does not explicitly separate spatial and temporal features. This is achieved in two key stages. First, we fine-tune Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers using an unordered set of frames from the video to learn an identity LoRA basis that represents the appearance, free from temporal interference. In the second stage, with the identity LoRAs frozen, we augment their coefficients with Motion Residuals and fine-tune them on the full video sequence, capturing motion dynamics. Our Set-and-Sequence framework resulting in spatio-temporal weight space effectively embeds dynamic concepts into the video models output domain, enabling unprecedented editability and compositionality, and setting new benchmark for personalizing dynamic concepts. The advent of generative models has revolutionized content creation, enabling the synthesis and manipulation of high-quality visual media with remarkable fidelity. Recent"

[ 1 7 7 3 4 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r aThe Diffusion Transformer plays pivotal role in advancing text-to-image and text-to-video generation, owing primarily to its inherent scalability. However, existing controlled diffusion transformer methods incur significant parameter and computational overheads and suffer from inefficient resource allocation due to their failure to account for the varying relevance of control information across different transformer layers. To address this, we propose the Relevance-Guided Efficient Controllable Generation framework, RelaCtrl, enabling efficient and resource-optimized integration of control signals into the Diffusion Transformer. First, we evaluate the relevance of each layer in the Diffusion Transformer to the control information by assessing the ControlNet Relevance Scorei.e., the impact of skipping each control layer on both the quality of generation and the control effectiveness during inference. Based on the strength of the relevance, we then tailor the positioning, parameter scale, and modeling capacity of the control layers to reduce unnecessary parameters and redundant computations. Additionally, to further improve efficiency, we replace the self-attention and FFN in the commonly used copy block with the carefully designed TwoDimensional Shuffle Mixer (TDSM), enabling efficient implementation of both the token mixer and channel mixer. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance with only 15% of the parameters and computational complexity compared to PixArt-Î´. More examples are available at https://relactrl.github.io/RelaCtrl/. *Equal contribution 1University of Science and Technology of China 2Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences 3360 AI Research 4Sun Yat-sen University 5Zhejiang University. Correspondence to: Ao Ma <maao@360.cn>, Jie Zhang <zhangjie@iim.ac.cn>. Figure 1. Effect of skipping specific position within the ControlNet block on the quality of the generated image. Higher FID and HDD indicate more significant impact of the skipped layer on the quality of the final results, reflecting stronger correlation with the generated image quality. 1. Introduction The Diffusion Transformer (DiT) (Peebles & Xie, 2023), with its strong scalability and multi-modal alignment capabilities, has significantly advanced the fields of text-toimage and text-to-video generation (like, PixArt-Î± (Chen et al., 2023), Flux (BlackForestlabs AI, 2024), Stable Diffusion 3 (Stability AI, 2024), CogVideoX (Yang et al., 2024), Sora (Brooks et al., 2024), HunyuanVideo (Li et al., 2024), and Qihoo-T2X (Wang et al., 2024), etc). By leveraging its robust architecture and scalability, the fidelity of the generated results and consistency with the given textual description are dramatically improved. Recent studies, such as PixArt-Î´ (Chen et al., 2024) and OminiControl (Tan et al., 2024), focus on controlled text-to-image generation based on the DiT framework, promoting its application in real-world scenarios such as AI-driven content creation and e-commerce shopping. However, current controlled generation methods for DiT face two main shortcomings. Firstly, significant number of additional parameters and computations are introduced, increasing the burden on training and inference. For example, PixArt-Î´ directly duplicates the first half of the networks blocks (i.e., 13 blocks), resulting in 50% increase in both the number of parameters and computational complexity. Similarly, the control token concatenation in 1 RelaCtrl: Relevance-Guided Efficient Control for Diffusion Transformers OminiControl adds only limited number of parameters but doubles the number of tokens involved in the attention and linear layers, leading to nearly 70% increase in overall computational complexity. Secondly, the varying relevance of control information across different layers of the network is often overlooked, resulting in inefficient allocation of computational resources. Our experiments on ControlNet Relevance Score, in which we trained controlled generative model by copying all blocks and removing control blocks from different layers during inference, revealed that different layers in DiT exhibit varying levels of relevance for control information. As shown in Fig. 1, this relevance follows trend of increasing and then decreasing, with higher relevance observed in the front-center layers and lower relevance in the deeper layers of the network, resulting in only slight performance loss (for more detailed explanation, please refer to Sec. 2.1). Existing methods neglect this variation and apply uniform settings to all layers that introduce control information, resulting in inefficient allocation of parameters and computational resources, such as redundant parameters or computations in layers with low relevance. To address the above issues, we propose the RelevanceGuided Efficient Controllable Generation framework (i.e., RelaCtrl) for diffusion transformer, based on control information relevance analysis. Specifically, to achieve efficient utilization of computational resources, we design relevanceguided allocation and steering strategies. Control blocks are placed at locations with high control information relevance, while locations with weak relevance are left without control blocks. To further reduce the number of parameters and computational complexity introduced by the copy control block operation, we design lightweight Two-Dimensional Shuffle Mixer (TDSM) to replace the self-attention and FFN layers in the copy block. Self-attention plays the role of token mixer and FFN plays the role of channel mixer. Therefore, to efficiently perform the same functions as the token mixer and channel mixer, TDSM first randomly selects varying number of feature channel groups, then randomly divides the token groups within each channel group, and finally computes the attention within each token-channel group along the token dimension. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TDSM can overcome the limitations of local grouping and enable non-local modeling in the channel-token dimensions. In addition, we regulate the number of channel division groups in TDSM based on the cor"

We introduce SigLIP 2, a family of new multilingual vision-language encoders that build on the success of the original SigLIP. In this second iteration, we extend the original image-text training objective with several prior, independently developed techniques into a unified recipe -- this includes captioning-based pretraining, self-supervised losses (self-distillation, masked prediction) and online data curation. With these changes, SigLIP 2 models outperform their SigLIP counterparts at all model scales in core capabilities, including zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and transfer performance when extracting visual representations for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Furthermore, the new training recipe leads to significant improvements on localization and dense prediction tasks. We also train variants which support multiple resolutions and preserve the input's native aspect ratio. Finally, we train on a more diverse data-mixture that includes de-biasing techniques, leading to much better multilingual understanding and improved fairness. To allow users to trade off inference cost with performance, we release model checkpoints at four sizes: ViT-B (86M), L (303M), So400m (400M), and g (1B).

Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can process inputs with context lengths up to 128k visual and text tokens, yet they struggle to generate coherent outputs beyond 1,000 words. We find that the primary limitation is the absence of long output examples during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). To tackle this issue, we introduce LongWriter-V-22k, a SFT dataset comprising 22,158 examples, each with multiple input images, an instruction, and corresponding outputs ranging from 0 to 10,000 words. Moreover, to achieve long outputs that maintain high-fidelity to the input images, we employ Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the SFT model. Given the high cost of collecting human feedback for lengthy outputs (e.g., 3,000 words), we propose IterDPO, which breaks long outputs into segments and uses iterative corrections to form preference pairs with the original outputs. Additionally, we develop MMLongBench-Write, a benchmark featuring six tasks to evaluate the long-generation capabilities of VLMs. Our 7B parameter model, trained with LongWriter-V-22k and IterDPO, achieves impressive performance on this benchmark, outperforming larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.

"Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can process inputs with context lengths up to 128k visual and text tokens, yet they struggle to generate coherent outputs beyond 1,000 words. We find that the primary limitation is the absence of long output examples during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). To tackle this issue, we introduce LongWriter-V-22k, a SFT dataset comprising 22,158 examples, each with multiple input images, an instruction, and corresponding outputs ranging from 0 to 10,000 words. Moreover, to achieve long outputs that maintain high-fidelity to the input images, we employ Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the SFT model. Given the high cost of collecting human feedback for lengthy outputs (e.g., 3,000 words), we propose IterDPO, which breaks long outputs into segments and uses iterative corrections to form preference pairs with the original outputs. Additionally, we develop MMLongBench-Write, a benchmark featuring six tasks to evaluate the long-generation capabilities of VLMs. Our 7B parameter model, trained with LongWriter-V-22k and IterDPO, achieves impressive performance on this benchmark, outperforming larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.

While the ability of language models to elicit facts has been widely investigated, how they handle temporally changing facts remains underexplored. We discover Temporal Heads, specific attention heads primarily responsible for processing temporal knowledge through circuit analysis. We confirm that these heads are present across multiple models, though their specific locations may vary, and their responses differ depending on the type of knowledge and its corresponding years. Disabling these heads degrades the model's ability to recall time-specific knowledge while maintaining its general capabilities without compromising time-invariant and question-answering performances. Moreover, the heads are activated not only numeric conditions ("In 2004") but also textual aliases ("In the year ..."), indicating that they encode a temporal dimension beyond simple numerical representation. Furthermore, we expand the potential of our findings by demonstrating how temporal knowledge can be edited by adjusting the values of these heads.

In the field of MLLM-based GUI agents, compared to smartphones, the PC scenario not only features a more complex interactive environment, but also involves more intricate intra- and inter-app workflows. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical agent framework named PC-Agent. Specifically, from the perception perspective, we devise an Active Perception Module (APM) to overcome the inadequate abilities of current MLLMs in perceiving screenshot content. From the decision-making perspective, to handle complex user instructions and interdependent subtasks more effectively, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent collaboration architecture that decomposes decision-making processes into Instruction-Subtask-Action levels. Within this architecture, three agents (i.e., Manager, Progress and Decision) are set up for instruction decomposition, progress tracking and step-by-step decision-making respectively. Additionally, a Reflection agent is adopted to enable timely bottom-up error feedback and adjustment. We also introduce a new benchmark PC-Eval with 25 real-world complex instructions. Empirical results on PC-Eval show that our PC-Agent achieves a 32% absolute improvement of task success rate over previous state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available.

"In the field of MLLM-based GUI agents, compared to smartphones, the PC scenario not only features a more complex interactive environment, but also involves more intricate intra- and inter-app workflows. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical agent framework named PC-Agent. Specifically, from the perception perspective, we devise an Active Perception Module (APM) to overcome the inadequate abilities of current MLLMs in perceiving screenshot content. From the decision-making perspective, to handle complex user instructions and interdependent subtasks more effectively, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent collaboration architecture that decomposes decision-making processes into Instruction-Subtask-Action levels. Within this architecture, three agents (i.e., Manager, Progress and Decision) are set up for instruction decomposition, progress tracking and step-by-step decision-making respectively. Additionally, a Reflection agent is adopted to enable timely bottom-up error feedback and adjustment. We also introduce a new benchmark PC-Eval with 25 real-world complex instructions. Empirical results on PC-Eval show that our PC-Agent achieves a 32% absolute improvement of task success rate over previous state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available."

Reasoning about images with rich text, such as charts and documents, is a critical application of vision-language models (VLMs). However, VLMs often struggle in these domains due to the scarcity of diverse text-rich vision-language data. To address this challenge, we present CoSyn, a framework that leverages the coding capabilities of text-only large language models (LLMs) to automatically create synthetic text-rich multimodal data. Given input text describing a target domain (e.g., "nutrition fact labels"), CoSyn prompts an LLM to generate code (Python, HTML, LaTeX, etc.) for rendering synthetic images. With the underlying code as textual representations of the synthetic images, CoSyn can generate high-quality instruction-tuning data, again relying on a text-only LLM. Using CoSyn, we constructed a dataset comprising 400K images and 2.7M rows of vision-language instruction-tuning data. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art performance among competitive open-source models, including Llama 3.2, and surpass proprietary models such as GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Flash. Furthermore, CoSyn can produce synthetic pointing data, enabling VLMs to ground information within input images, showcasing its potential for developing multimodal agents capable of acting in real-world environments.

Personalizing generative text-to-image models has seen remarkable progress, but extending this personalization to text-to-video models presents unique challenges. Unlike static concepts, personalizing text-to-video models has the potential to capture dynamic concepts, i.e., entities defined not only by their appearance but also by their motion. In this paper, we introduce Set-and-Sequence, a novel framework for personalizing Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)-based generative video models with dynamic concepts. Our approach imposes a spatio-temporal weight space within an architecture that does not explicitly separate spatial and temporal features. This is achieved in two key stages. First, we fine-tune Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers using an unordered set of frames from the video to learn an identity LoRA basis that represents the appearance, free from temporal interference. In the second stage, with the identity LoRAs frozen, we augment their coefficients with Motion Residuals and fine-tune them on the full video sequence, capturing motion dynamics. Our Set-and-Sequence framework results in a spatio-temporal weight space that effectively embeds dynamic concepts into the video model's output domain, enabling unprecedented editability and compositionality while setting a new benchmark for personalizing dynamic concepts.

Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1, we explore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) in large reasoning models. To analyze reasoning dynamics, we use synthetic logic puzzles as training data due to their controllable complexity and straightforward answer verification. We make some key technical contributions that lead to effective and stable RL training: a system prompt that emphasizes the thinking and answering process, a stringent format reward function that penalizes outputs for taking shortcuts, and a straightforward training recipe that achieves stable convergence. Our 7B model develops advanced reasoning skills-such as reflection, verification, and summarization-that are absent from the logic corpus. Remarkably, after training on just 5K logic problems, it demonstrates generalization abilities to the challenging math benchmarks AIME and AMC.

The Diffusion Transformer plays a pivotal role in advancing text-to-image and text-to-video generation, owing primarily to its inherent scalability. However, existing controlled diffusion transformer methods incur significant parameter and computational overheads and suffer from inefficient resource allocation due to their failure to account for the varying relevance of control information across different transformer layers. To address this, we propose the Relevance-Guided Efficient Controllable Generation framework, RelaCtrl, enabling efficient and resource-optimized integration of control signals into the Diffusion Transformer. First, we evaluate the relevance of each layer in the Diffusion Transformer to the control information by assessing the "ControlNet Relevance Score"-i.e., the impact of skipping each control layer on both the quality of generation and the control effectiveness during inference. Based on the strength of the relevance, we then tailor the positioning, parameter scale, and modeling capacity of the control layers to reduce unnecessary parameters and redundant computations. Additionally, to further improve efficiency, we replace the self-attention and FFN in the commonly used copy block with the carefully designed Two-Dimensional Shuffle Mixer (TDSM), enabling efficient implementation of both the token mixer and channel mixer. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance with only 15% of the parameters and computational complexity compared to PixArt-delta.
