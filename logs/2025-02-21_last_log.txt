Text:"5 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 8 7 6 4 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r a k kqn kqn Mila and McGill University ServiceNow Research Canada CIFAR AI Chair {arkil.patel, siva.reddy, bahdanau}@mila.quebec Abstract The pace of evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates new approaches for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation. Traditional human annotation is increasingly impracticable due to the complexities and costs involved in generating high-quality, challenging problems. In this work, we introduce CHASE, unified framework to synthetically generate challenging problems using LLMs without human involvement. For given task, our approach builds hard problem in bottom-up manner from simpler components. Moreover, our framework decomposes the generation process into independently verifiable sub-tasks, thereby ensuring high level of quality and correctness. We implement CHASE to create evaluation benchmarks across three diverse domains: (1) document-based question answering, (2) repository-level code completion, and (3) math reasoning. The performance of state-of-the-art LLMs on these synthetic benchmarks lies in the range of 40-60% accuracy, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework at generating challenging problems. We publicly release our benchmarks and code. In the past few years, we have witnessed the emergence of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) (Gemini Team et al., 2024, Llama Team et al., 2024, OpenAI Team et al., 2024) that exhibit remarkable performance over wide range of tasks. However, the resources for evaluating these models have not kept pace with their rapid evolution and increased capabilities. Contemporary LLMs have saturated many existing reasoning benchmarks (Chen et al., 2021, Cobbe et al., 2021). Developing challenging problems for such reasoning tasks can be both expensive and time-consuming, especially for non-expert human annotators. Moreover, there are some settings, such as tasks requiring long-context reasoning over thousands of tokens, where"

Text:"Multimodal RewardBench: Holistic Evaluation of Reward Models for Vision Language Models Michihiro Yasunaga1, Luke Zettlemoyer1, Marjan Ghazvininejad1 1FAIR at Meta Reward models play an essential role in training vision-language models (VLMs) by assessing output quality to enable aligning with human preferences. Despite their importance, the research community lacks comprehensive open benchmarks for evaluating multimodal reward models. To address this gap, we introduce Multimodal RewardBench, an expert-annotated benchmark covering six domains: general correctness, preference, knowledge, reasoning, safety, and visual question-answering. Our dataset comprises 5,211 annotated (prompt, chosen response, rejected response) triplets collected from various VLMs. In evaluating range of VLM judges, we find that even the top-performing models, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieve only 72% overall accuracy. Notably, most models struggle in the reasoning and safety domains. These findings suggest that Multimodal RewardBench offers challenging testbed for advancing reward model development across multiple domains. We release the benchmark at https://github.com/facebookresearch/multimodal_rewardbench. 5 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 1 9 1 4 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r Figure 1 Illustration of Multimodal RewardBench. We build human-annotated benchmark that consists of (multimodal prompt, chosen response, rejected response) triplets (left). Using this benchmark, we evaluate the accuracy of various reward models or judges for vision-language models (right). See for real examples from our benchmark. High quality reward models or judges are essential for aligning language models (LMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022b; Llama Team, 2024). Reward models assess the quality of model outputs, guiding models towards accurate, helpful, and safe outputs via RLHF-style algorithms. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating reward model quality are typically limited to "

The pace of evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates new approaches for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation. Traditional human annotation is increasingly impracticable due to the complexities and costs involved in generating high-quality, challenging problems. In this work, we introduce CHASE, a unified framework to synthetically generate challenging problems using LLMs without human involvement. For a given task, our approach builds a hard problem in a bottom-up manner from simpler components. Moreover, our framework decomposes the generation process into independently verifiable sub-tasks, thereby ensuring a high level of quality and correctness. We implement CHASE to create evaluation benchmarks across three diverse domains: (1) document-based question answering, (2) repository-level code completion, and (3) math reasoning. The performance of state-of-the-art LLMs on these synthetic benchmarks lies in the range of 40-60% accuracy, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework at generating challenging problems. We publicly release our benchmarks and code.

Reward models play an essential role in training vision-language models (VLMs) by assessing output quality to enable aligning with human preferences. Despite their importance, the research community lacks comprehensive open benchmarks for evaluating multimodal reward models in VLMs. To address this gap, we introduce Multimodal RewardBench, an expert-annotated benchmark covering six domains: general correctness, preference, knowledge, reasoning, safety, and visual question-answering. Our dataset comprises 5,211 annotated (prompt, chosen response, rejected response) triplets collected from various VLMs. In evaluating a range of VLM judges, we find that even the top-performing models, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieve only 72% overall accuracy. Notably, most models struggle in the reasoning and safety domains. These findings suggest that Multimodal RewardBench offers a challenging testbed for advancing reward model development across multiple domains. We release the benchmark at https://github.com/facebookresearch/multimodal_rewardbench.

"Reward models play an essential role in training vision-language models (VLMs) by assessing output quality to enable aligning with human preferences. Despite their importance, the research community lacks comprehensive open benchmarks for evaluating multimodal reward models in VLMs. To address this gap, we introduce Multimodal RewardBench, an expert-annotated benchmark covering six domains: general correctness, preference, knowledge, reasoning, safety, and visual question-answering. Our dataset comprises 5,211 annotated (prompt, chosen response, rejected response) triplets collected from various VLMs. In evaluating a range of VLM judges, we find that even the top-performing models, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieve only 72% overall accuracy. Notably, most models struggle in the reasoning and safety domains. These findings suggest that Multimodal RewardBench offers a challenging testbed for advancing reward model development across multiple domains. We release the benchmark at https://github.com/facebookresearch/multimodal_rewardbench."
