Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success through imitation learning on vast text corpora, but this paradigm creates training-generation gap and limits robust reasoning. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers more data-efficient solution capable of bridging this gap, yet its application has been constrained by critical data bottleneck: existing RL datasets are orders of magnitude smaller and less diverse than web-scale pre-training corpora. To address this, we introduce the Webscale-RL pipeline, scalable data engine that systematically converts large-scale pre-training documents into millions of diverse, verifiable question-answer pairs for RL. Using this pipeline, we construct the Webscale-RL dataset, containing 1.2 million examples across more than 9 domains. Our experiments show that the model trained on this dataset significantly outperforms continual pretraining and strong data refinement baselines across suite of benchmarks. Notably, RL training with our dataset proves substantially more efficient, achieving the performance of continual pre-training with up to 100 fewer tokens. Our work presents viable path toward scaling RL to pre-training levels, enabling more capable and efficient language models. Code SalesforceAIResearch/PretrainRL-pipeline Dataset Salesforce/Webscale-RL Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, primarily through learning on vast text corpora. However, this predominant paradigm, which includes pretraining with nexttoken prediction and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), is fundamentally in the form of imitation learning.

To address this gap, we introduce StatEval, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring academic rigor. We further propose robust evaluation framework tailored to both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57% on research-level problems, with opensource models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs. We expect StatEval to serve as rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our web platform: https://stateval.github.io/. Keywords: Statistical reasoning; Automated extraction, Proof verification; Multi-agent evaluati"

A scalable data engine converts large-scale pre-training documents into diverse question-answer pairs for reinforcement learning, significantly improving model performance and efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success through imitation learning on vast text corpora, but this paradigm creates a training-generation gap and limits robust reasoning. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a more data-efficient solution capable of bridging this gap, yet its application has been constrained by a critical data bottleneck: existing RL datasets are orders of magnitude smaller and less diverse than web-scale pre-training corpora. To address this, we introduce the Webscale-RL pipeline, a scalable data engine that systematically converts large-scale pre-training documents into millions of diverse, verifiable question-answer pairs for RL. Using this pipeline, we construct the Webscale-RL dataset, containing 1.2 million examples across more than 9 domains. Our experiments show that the model trained on this dataset significantly outperforms continual pretraining and strong data refinement baselines across a suite of benchmarks. Notably, RL training with our dataset proves substantially more efficient, achieving the performance of continual pre-training with up to 100times fewer tokens. Our work presents a viable path toward scaling RL to pre-training levels, enabling more capable and efficient language models.

StatEval is a comprehensive benchmark for statistical reasoning, covering foundational and research-level problems, and highlights the limitations of current LLMs in this domain.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To address this gap, we introduce StatEval, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs. We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical intelligence in large language models.

"StatEval is a comprehensive benchmark for statistical reasoning, covering foundational and research-level problems, and highlights the limitations of current LLMs in this domain.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To address this gap, we introduce StatEval, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs. We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our web platform: https://stateval.github.io/."

Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO) extends prompt optimization to handle multiple data types, improving performance over text-only methods in various applications.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images, videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Parallel test-time scaling is enabled for latent reasoning models using uncertainty-inspired sampling strategies and a Latent Reward Model for effective trajectory selection.  					AI-generated summary 				 Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM) trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection. Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

PhysToolBench evaluates MLLMs' comprehension of physical tools through a VQA dataset, revealing significant deficiencies in tool understanding.  					AI-generated summary 				 The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs. It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source, specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

A framework evaluates DeepResearch systems by assessing the quality, redundancy, and factuality of their research reports using an LLM-as-a-Judge methodology.  					AI-generated summary 				 DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights, and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12 real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research partners.

Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP) improves token efficiency in large reasoning models without significantly reducing accuracy, especially for complex problems, by regularizing reasoning at the step level.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost. Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems. Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model sizes.

"Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP) improves token efficiency in large reasoning models without significantly reducing accuracy, especially for complex problems, by regularizing reasoning at the step level.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost. Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems. Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model sizes."

MRMR is a benchmark for expert-level multidisciplinary multimodal retrieval that includes reasoning-intensive tasks, contradiction retrieval, and image-text interleaved sequences, highlighting the need for improved multimodal models.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce MRMR, the first expert-level multidisciplinary multimodal retrieval benchmark requiring intensive reasoning. MRMR contains 1,502 queries spanning 23 domains, with positive documents carefully verified by human experts. Compared to prior benchmarks, MRMR introduces three key advancements. First, it challenges retrieval systems across diverse areas of expertise, enabling fine-grained model comparison across domains. Second, queries are reasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as diagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a novel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries and documents are constructed as image-text interleaved sequences. Unlike earlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR offers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus documents. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal retrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model Qwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest performance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval models. Although latest multimodal models such as Ops-MM-Embedding perform competitively on expert-domain queries, they fall short on reasoning-intensive tasks. We believe that MRMR paves the way for advancing multimodal retrieval in more realistic and challenging scenarios.

A plan-and-execute framework with EAGLET enhances LLM-based agents' planning abilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-horizon tasks with reduced training costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Agents based on large language models (LLMs) struggle with brainless trial-and-error and generating hallucinatory actions due to a lack of global planning in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we introduce a plan-and-execute framework and propose EAGLET, an efficient and effective planner training method to enhance the executor agent's planning abilities without human effort. Specifically, we train a plug-and-play global planner through a two-step process: we first synthesize high-quality plans from an advanced LLM using our proposed homologous consensus filtering strategy, and apply fine-tuning as a cold start. Moreover, we further improve the planner with a rule-based reinforcement learning stage using a novel executor capability gain reward, ensuring it can handle task instructions of varying difficulty. Experiments on three long-horizon agent tasks show that executor agents equipped with our planner outperform existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, EAGLET reduces training costs by 8x compared to RL-based baselines, and it does not require manual effort or extra training data, offering an efficient and effective solution.
