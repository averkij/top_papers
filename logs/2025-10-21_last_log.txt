This survey traces the paradigm shift in building agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm, where these capabilities are internalized within the models parameters. We first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins unified solution of ùêøùêøùëÄ + ùëÖùêø +ùëá ùëéùë†ùëò across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey systematically reviews how each capabilityPlanning, Tool use, and Memoryhas evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors. Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments outline coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing"

[ 1 3 3 3 6 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r a Junha Song1,2, Sangdoo Yun2, Dongyoon Han2, Jaegul Choo1, Byeongho Heo2 1KAIST, 2NAVER AI Lab Corresponding author dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created void in the understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning (SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversightnamely, the significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows clear advantage over SFT in strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLMs post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLMs underlying visual representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT, boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our findings into simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs, Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs, PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Date: October 21, 2025 Project page: https://june-pa"

As information grows exponentially, enterprises face increasing pressure to transform unstructured data into coherent, actionable insights. While autonomous agents show promise, they often struggle with domain-specific nuances, intent alignment, and enterprise integration. We present Enterprise Deep Research (EDR), multi-agent system that integrates (1) Master Planning Agent for adaptive query decomposition, (2) four specialized search agents (General, Academic, GitHub, LinkedIn), (3) an extensible MCP-based tool ecosystem supporting NL2SQL, file analysis, and enterprise workflows, (4) Visualization Agent for data-driven insights, and (5) reflection mechanism that detects knowledge gaps and updates research direction with optional human-in-the-loop steering guidance. These components enable automated report generation, real-time streaming, and seamless enterprise deployment, as validated on internal datasets. On open-ended benchmarks including DeepResearch Bench and DeepConsult, EDR outperforms state-ofthe-art agentic systems without any human steering. We release the EDR framework and benchmark trajectories to advance research on multi-agent reasoning applications. Code github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/enterprise-deep-research Dataset huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/EDR- Recent advances in LLMs have driven the emergence of general-purpose language agents capable of performing wide range of reasoning-intensive tasksincluding research assistance [36, 12], retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [38], coding [47, 46], and knowledge synthesis.

The dataset features wide range of single-person motion data, including prompted motions, hand gestures, and locomotion; as well as multi-person behavioral and conversational data like discussions, conversations in different emotional states, collaborative activities, and co-living scenarios in an apartment-like space. We provide tracked human motion including hand tracking and body shape, text annotations, and separate audio track for each participant. Date: October 21, 2025 Dataset: https://www.meta.com/emerging-tech/codec-avatars/embody-3d aindividual hours refers to number of person-hours in the collection. If we collect one hour of conversation between two participants, it would amount to two individual hours of motion data. The development of robust motion understanding and synthesis systems critically depends on the availability of high-quality, large-scale motion datasets. However, current datasets face fundamental trade-offs: they either achieve scale at the expense of quality and completeness [19, 10, 3, 1], or provide high-quality data in limited quantities [13, 5, 4, 9, 14, 16, 6, 17, 8, 11], see Table 1.

Text:"AsyncVoice Agent: Real-Time Explanation for LLM Planning and Reasoning Yueqian Lin1,2, Zhengmian Hu2, Jayakumar Subramanian2, Qinsi Wang1,2 Nikos Vlassis2, Hai Helen Li1, Yiran Chen1 1Duke University, Durham, NC, USA 2Adobe Research, San Jose, CA, USA 5 2 0 2 7 ] . e [ 1 6 5 1 6 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r from methods like Chain-of-Thought AbstractEffective human-AI collaboration on complex reasoning tasks requires that users understand and interact with the models process, not just receive an output. However, the monolithic text (CoT) prevents this, as current interfaces lack real-time verbalization and robust user barge-in. We present AsyncVoice Agent, system whose asynchronous architecture decouples streaming LLM backend from conversational voice frontend. This design allows narration and inference to run in parallel, empowering users to interrupt, query, and steer the models reasoning process at any time. Objective benchmarks show this approach reduces interaction latency by more than 600 compared to monolithic baselines while ensuring high fidelity and competitive task accuracy. By enabling two-way dialogue with models thought process, AsyncVoice Agent offers new paradigm for building more effective, steerable, and trustworthy human-AI systems for high-stakes tasks.1 Index TermsReal-Time Interaction, Asynchronous Agents, Human-AI Collaboration, Planning, Reasoning. of an agents internal reasoning stream, and allowing for user interruption during this process, remains significant, unaddressed gap. To fill this gap, this paper presents the architecture and demonstration of AsyncVoice Agent, system designed to serve as an interactive, real-time voice interface for explaining an LLMs ongoing reasoning processes. Rather than verbalizing static block of text, our system narrates each thought process as it streams from the model. The primary contribution is system that enables truly asynchronous dialogue about live reasoning process, allowing user to seamlessly interrupt the age"

Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG) enhance AI research replication by integrating technical insights and code snippets from scientific literature, improving performance in automated replication tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language model (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable code, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent technical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches tend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured knowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To overcome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a modular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical insights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from scientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two different LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on PaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible solution for automated AI research replication. Code will released at https://github.com/zjunlp/xKG.

FineVision, a large-scale and curated dataset, enhances vision-language models through rigorous data collection, de-duplication, and human oversight, leading to improved performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 The advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by a fragmented landscape of inconsistent and contaminated public datasets. We introduce FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million samples - the largest open resource of its kind. We unify more than 200 sources into 185 subsets via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline: automation performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity. Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

AI-generated summary 				 The advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by a fragmented landscape of inconsistent and contaminated public datasets. We introduce FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million samples - the largest open resource of its kind.

The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity. Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight.

The survey outlines the shift from pipeline-based to model-native agentic AI, emphasizing the role of reinforcement learning in integrating planning, tool use, and memory within large language models across various domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial intelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but act, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm, where these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey systematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory -- has evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors. Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments outline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing systems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence through experience.

Large reasoning models are vulnerable to reasoning distraction, where irrelevant tasks embedded in prompts reduce accuracy, and a combined SFT and RL defense improves robustness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled remarkable performance on complex tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. In this paper, we identify and systematically analyze a critical vulnerability we term reasoning distraction, where LRMs are diverted from their primary objective by irrelevant yet complex tasks maliciously embedded in the prompt. Through a comprehensive study across diverse models and benchmarks, we show that even state-of-the-art LRMs are highly susceptible, with injected distractors reducing task accuracy by up to 60%. We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this weakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden adversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final output. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on challenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as a distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step toward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.

Reinforcement Learning enhances vision encoders in Multimodal Language Models, leading to better visual representations and performance compared to Supervised Fine-tuning.  					AI-generated summary 				 A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning (SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT, boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs, Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs, a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at https://june-page.github.io/pivot/

Glyph compresses long textual inputs into images using vision-language models, achieving significant token compression and improved performance in long-context tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning. However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs. In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.

Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning (DSER) extends the reasoning capabilities of smaller models by iteratively improving solutions through a probabilistic Markov chain, enabling them to solve previously unsolvable problems and surpass larger models in accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning has become a cornerstone of advanced reasoning in large language models. While recent verification-refinement frameworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems, their effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction capabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This work demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities on hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially extended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning (DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step represents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is that convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability of improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple long-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small positive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct answers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On the challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously unsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model to surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through majority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER framework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight reasoners. By clearly delineating their shortcomings in self-verification, refinement, and stability, our findings establish a clear research agenda for developing next-generation models with powerful, intrinsic self-evolving capabilities.

"Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning (DSER) extends the reasoning capabilities of smaller models by iteratively improving solutions through a probabilistic Markov chain, enabling them to solve previously unsolvable problems and surpass larger models in accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning has become a cornerstone of advanced reasoning in large language models. While recent verification-refinement frameworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems, their effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction capabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This work demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities on hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially extended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning (DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step represents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is that convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability of improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple long-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small positive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct answers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On the challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously unsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model to surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through majority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER framework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight reasoners. By clearly delineating their shortcomings in self-verification, refinement, and stability, our findings establish a clear research agenda for developing next-generation models with powerful, intrinsic self-evolving capabilities."

A novel three-stage method, Wiki-PRF, enhances knowledge-based visual question answering by improving multimodal query quality and relevance through visual language models and reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

"A novel three-stage method, Wiki-PRF, enhances knowledge-based visual question answering by improving multimodal query quality and relevance through visual language models and reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

AsyncVoice Agent, with its asynchronous architecture, enhances human-AI collaboration by enabling real-time interaction and interruption of the model's reasoning process, significantly reducing latency while maintaining accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Effective human-AI collaboration on complex reasoning tasks requires that users understand and interact with the model's process, not just receive an output. However, the monolithic text from methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prevents this, as current interfaces lack real-time verbalization and robust user barge-in. We present AsyncVoice Agent, a system whose asynchronous architecture decouples a streaming LLM backend from a conversational voice frontend. This design allows narration and inference to run in parallel, empowering users to interrupt, query, and steer the model's reasoning process at any time. Objective benchmarks show this approach reduces interaction latency by more than 600x compared to monolithic baselines while ensuring high fidelity and competitive task accuracy. By enabling a two-way dialogue with a model's thought process, AsyncVoice Agent offers a new paradigm for building more effective, steerable, and trustworthy human-AI systems for high-stakes tasks.
