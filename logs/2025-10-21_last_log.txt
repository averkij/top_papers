Text:"DeepAnalyze: Agentic Large Language Models for Autonomous Data Science Shaolei Zhang 1 Ju Fan 1 Meihao Fan 1 Guoliang Li 2 Xiaoyong Du 1 (cid:135) ruc-datalab/DeepAnalyze DeepAnalyze-8B DataScience-Instruct-500K ruc-deepanalyze.github.io 5 2 0 2 9 1 ] . [ 1 2 7 8 6 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r Abstract Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research reports, has been long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B, the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science tasks, we propose curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world environments. We also introduce data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training, DeepAnalyze learns to perform broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced, paving the way toward autonomous data science. 1.

For instance, in color-editing tasks, they struggle to maintain structural consistency in edited regions while preserving the rest intact. This limitation becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.

Text:"Towards Mixed-Modal Retrieval for Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation Chenghao Zhang Guanting Dong Renmin University of China Beijing, China chenghao-zhang@outlook.com Xinyu Yang Zhicheng Dou Renmin University of China Beijing, China dou@ruc.edu.cn 5 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 4 5 3 7 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r Abstract Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an external corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this paper, we address the challenge of Universal RetrievalAugmented Generation (URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, unified mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce four-stage automated pipeline for data generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct NyxQA, dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality dataset, we adopt two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform pre-training on NyxQA along with variety of open-source retrieval datasets, followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality in vision-language tasks.

This limitation becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing. Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.

Beam search in discrete visual autoregressive models enhances text-to-image generation more effectively than search in continuous diffusion models, highlighting architecture's importance over scale.  					AI-generated summary 				 While inference-time scaling through search has revolutionized Large Language Models, translating these gains to image generation has proven difficult. Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.

PICABench and PICAEval evaluate physical realism in image editing by assessing eight sub-dimensions and using VLM-as-a-judge with human annotations, highlighting the need for physics-based solutions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment, how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions. Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive content editing toward physically consistent realism.

Nyx, a unified mixed-modal retriever, enhances vision-language generation by retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal data, outperforming existing RAG systems in real-world scenarios.  					AI-generated summary 				 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an external corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this paper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated pipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct NyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality dataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform pre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets, followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality in vision-language tasks.

A novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism in custom convolutional neural networks improves satellite land use classification accuracy to 97.23% on the EuroSAT dataset without pre-trained models.  					AI-generated summary 				 This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23% test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models. Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%, CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57, indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete code, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.
