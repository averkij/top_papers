Beacon reframes sycophancy as measurable form of normative misgeneralization, providing reproducible foundation for studying and mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.Large language models (LLMs) such as Llama 3.1 and mixture-of-experts architectures like Mixtral have achieved remarkable progress across scientific, commercial, and creative domains. As capabilities scale, ensuring that these systems remain aligned with human values and factual accuracy has become central challenge. Standard alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) have mitigated overt failure modes related to toxicity or factual inconsistency, yet they leave subtler behavioral biases embedded in model policies largely unaddressed. One pervasive example is sycophancy - the tendency of model to prioritize user agreement, emotional validation, or social compliance over principled reasoning. This bias arises when reward-model optimization implicitly conflates politeness with helpfulness, causing models to avoid disagreement even when correction is warranted. The result is breakdown of epistemic calibration: models that echo user beliefs rather than critically evaluate them. As LLMs increasingly mediate information and reasoning, this distortion of epistemic integrity poses structural risk to trustworthy alignment. Existing evaluation benchmarks measure factuality, safety, or dialogue coherence, but none are designed to expose the latent preference for agreement that defines sycophancy. Multi-turn benchmarks confound conversational context, while domain-specific tasks blur the boundary between reasoning quality and social alignment. Furthermore, conventional scoring paradigms entangle fluency, tone, and correctness, obscuring the mechanisms that drive agreement bias. This gap prevents systematic diagnosis and targeted mitigation. To address this, we conceptualize sycophancy as latent decision bias detectable through constrained choice. Drawing from psychophysical signal detection and decision-theoretic choice modeling, our forced-choice evaluation inherits the classical aim of isolating sensitivity and bias through structured binary comparisons, compelling models to choose between mutually exclusive responses to reveal systematic preference patterns. This setting isolates policy-level preferences that are otherwise masked in free-form text generation. 1 2 Building on this framework, we introduce Beacon, single-turn forced-choice benchmark that quantifies sycophantic bias under controlled conditions. Each prompt is paired with two carefully constructed responses: principled answer grounded in reasoning and evidence, and sycophantic alternative that prioritizes agreement or emotional affirmation. Dual human annotations rate responses along axes of Critical Thinking and Fluency, enabling fine-grained decomposition of model behavior. Our analysis reveals that sycophancy decomposes into discrete and interpretable failure modes including hedged sycophancy, tone penalty, emotional framing, and fluency bias, each reflecting different linguistic or motivational bias underlying the preference for agreement. Beyond diagnosis, we evaluate both prompt-level and representation-level mitigation strategies. Prompt preambles informed by model-specific susceptibility profiles reduce overt sycophantic behavior, while residual latent biases motivate activation-level interventions. We implement cluster-specific activation steering, an interpretability technique that perturbs model hidden states along identified sycophantic subspaces, effectively suppressing these latent tendencies without degrading fluency.1. We present Beacon, benchmark of 420 hand-curated promptresponse pairs enabling forced-choice evaluation of sycophantic bias, with dual human annotation along Critical Thinking and Fluency. 2. We establish comprehensive sycophancy baselines across twelve state-of-the-art LLMs, identifying model-specific failure modes and showing that bias intensity increases with model scale. 3. We demonstrate targeted prompt-based interventions that reduce overt sycophantic responses and expose persistent latent failure modes. 4. We apply cluster-specific activation steering to manipulate sycophancy-related activation subspaces, providing evidence that the bias is encoded in identifiable representational structures amenable to mechanism-level mitigation. Beacon transforms sycophancy from vague, anecdotal flaw into measurable and mechanistically grounded phenomenon. By providing rigorous framework for detection and mitigation, it lays the groundwork for more transparent and effective alignment research."

Beacon, a benchmark, measures sycophancy in large language models, revealing it as a combination of linguistic and affective biases that can be mitigated through interventions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models internalize a structural trade-off between truthfulness and obsequious flattery, emerging from reward optimization that conflates helpfulness with polite submission. This latent bias, known as sycophancy, manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.

"Beacon, a benchmark, measures sycophancy in large language models, revealing it as a combination of linguistic and affective biases that can be mitigated through interventions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models internalize a structural trade-off between truthfulness and obsequious flattery, emerging from reward optimization that conflates helpfulness with polite submission. This latent bias, known as sycophancy, manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems."
