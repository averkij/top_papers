Human intervention patterns in web navigation are modeled to improve agent adaptability and collaboration, with language models achieving better intervention prediction and user satisfaction.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite rapid progress in autonomous web agents, human involvement remains essential for shaping preferences and correcting agent behavior as tasks unfold. However, current agentic systems lack a principled understanding of when and why humans intervene, often proceeding autonomously past critical decision points or requesting unnecessary confirmation. In this work, we introduce the task of modeling human intervention to support collaborative web task execution. We collect CowCorpus, a dataset of 400 real-user web navigation trajectories containing over 4,200 interleaved human and agent actions. We identify four distinct patterns of user interaction with agents -- hands-off supervision, hands-on oversight, collaborative task-solving, and full user takeover. Leveraging these insights, we train language models (LMs) to anticipate when users are likely to intervene based on their interaction styles, yielding a 61.4-63.4% improvement in intervention prediction accuracy over base LMs. Finally, we deploy these intervention-aware models in live web navigation agents and evaluate them in a user study, finding a 26.5% increase in user-rated agent usefulness. Together, our results show structured modeling of human intervention leads to more adaptive, collaborative agents.

**Reasoning:** The paper focuses on modeling human intervention patterns to improve agent behavior and alignment with user preferences. The core contribution is training language models to predict when users will intervene and using these insights to create more adaptive agents that better satisfy user needs and preferences. This directly relates to ALIGNMENT, which concerns aligning language models with human values, preferences, and intended behavior. The paper explicitly addresses how agents can better understand and respond to human feedback and intervention patterns to improve collaboration and user satisfaction.
