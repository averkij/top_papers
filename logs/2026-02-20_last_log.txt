Text:"Hardware Co-Design Scaling Laws via Roofline Modelling for On-Device LLMs Luoyang Sun1,2,3,4, Jiwen Jiang1,2,4, Yifeng Ding4, Fengfa Li4, Yan Song5, Haifeng Zhang2,3, Jian Ying1, Lei Ren4,, Kun Zhan4, Wei Chen4,, Yan Xie4 and Cheng Deng6, 1AI Lab, The Yangtze River Delta, 2Institution of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 3University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 4Li Auto, 5University College London, 6The University of Edinburgh Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) have emerged as key paradigm of Physical AI and are increasingly deployed in autonomous vehicles, robots, and smart spaces. In these resource-constrained on-device settings, selecting an appropriate large language model (LLM) backbone is critical challenge: models must balance accuracy with strict inference latency and hardware efficiency constraints. This makes hardware-software co-design game-changing requirement for on-device LLM deployment, where each hardware platform demands tailored architectural solution. We propose hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance. Specifically, we model training loss as an explicit function of architectural hyperparameters and characterise inference latency via roofline modelling. We empirically evaluate 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit scaling law relating architecture to training loss. By coupling this scaling law with latency modelling, we establish direct accuracy-latency correspondence and identify the Pareto frontier for hardware co-designed LLMs. We further formulate architecture search as joint optimisation over precision and performance, deriving feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets. Our approach reduces architecture selection from months to days. At the same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on the target hardware, our co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2. To our knowledge,"

A hardware-software co-design framework for on-device large language model deployment that establishes accuracy-latency relationships through training loss modeling and roofline analysis, enabling rapid architecture selection and improved performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) have emerged as a key paradigm of Physical AI and are increasingly deployed in autonomous vehicles, robots, and smart spaces. In these resource-constrained on-device settings, selecting an appropriate large language model (LLM) backbone is a critical challenge: models must balance accuracy with strict inference latency and hardware efficiency constraints. This makes hardware-software co-design a game-changing requirement for on-device LLM deployment, where each hardware platform demands a tailored architectural solution. We propose a hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance. Specifically, we model training loss as an explicit function of architectural hyperparameters and characterise inference latency via roofline modelling. We empirically evaluate 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit a scaling law relating architecture to training loss. By coupling this scaling law with latency modelling, we establish a direct accuracy-latency correspondence and identify the Pareto frontier for hardware co-designed LLMs. We further formulate architecture search as a joint optimisation over precision and performance, deriving feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets. Our approach reduces architecture selection from months to days. At the same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on the target hardware, our co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2. To our knowledge, this is the first principled and operational framework for hardware co-design scaling laws in on-device LLM deployment. We will make the code and related checkpoints publicly available.
