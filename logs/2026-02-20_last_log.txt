We compare two feedback strategies: No Intermediate (NI) feedback (top), where the system acknowledges the request and remains silent until delivering the final result, versus Planning & Results (PR) feedback (bottom), where planned steps and intermediate outcomes are communicated through synchronized audio and visual updates. The illustrated task exemplifies the multi-step operations agentic assistants perform, including contact lookup, address extraction, battery check, and charging stop planning. Our study (N=45) examines effects on perceived latency, trust, task load, and user experience in stationary and driving contexts.

**Reasoning:** The paper directly addresses aligning AI assistant behavior with user preferences and values. Specifically, it investigates how agentic LLM-based assistants should communicate with users to build trust and meet user expectations. The findings about adaptive feedback mechanisms, transparency levels, and user preferences for system behavior are core alignment concerns—ensuring the AI system's communication and operation align with what users value and prefer.

**Reasoning:** The paper directly addresses aligning AI assistant behavior with user preferences and values. Specifically, it investigates how agentic LLM-based assistants should communicate with users to build trust and meet user expectations. The findings about adaptive feedback mechanisms, transparency levels, and user preferences for system behavior are core alignment concerns—ensuring the AI system"s communication and operation align with what users value and prefer.
