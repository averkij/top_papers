Text:"Calibrate-Then-Act: Cost-Aware Exploration in LLM Agents Wenxuan Ding 1 Nicholas Tomlin 1 Greg Durrett 1 6 2 0 2 9 1 ] . [ 2 9 9 6 6 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aLLMs are increasingly being used for complex problems which are not necessarily resolved in single response, but require interacting with an environment to acquire information. In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent costuncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on programming task, an LLM should test generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA. Our results on information-seeking QA and on simplified coding task show that making cost-benefit tradeoffs explicit with CTA can help agents discover more optimal decision-making strategies. 1. Introduction Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly tasked with operating in environments where information is incomplete. Behaving rationally requires gaining information by exploring the environment. However, exploration comes with cost: every additional step increases API costs, interaction latency, and user burden. 1New York University. Ding <wd2403@nyu.edu>. https://github.com/Wenwen-D/env-explorer. Correspondence to: Wenxuan Code and data available at Preprint. February 20, 2026. 1 Figure 1. Given the same task, coding agent may either verify assumptions via intermediate checks carefully (right) or attempt direct solution as soon as possible (left). The optimal choice depends on uncertainty and specific cost constraints. CalibrateThen-Act (CTA) materializes this information for better decisionmaking. This exploration and its cost come in many forms. In software development and debugging, agents must decide whether to run targeted checks or perform full execution before committing to solution (Zhou et al., 2025). In machine learning experimentation, practitioners balance inexpensive proxy evaluations against costly full training runs under limited compute budgets (Ji & Carin, 2007; Hennig et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2025). In diagnosis and scientific discovery, additional tests or experiments reduce uncertainty but incur monetary, temporal, or safety costs (Karkkainen et al., 2019; Li & Oliva, 2025; Gupta et al., 2025). Online decisionmaking settings such as shopping (Yang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2025d), recommendation (Herlihy et al., 2024), and tool-augmented question answering (Yao et al., 2023) exhibit the same structure, as agents weigh further information gathering against acting with partial information. Agent policies for this exploration depend in complex way on their prompt, their inputs, and their training data. However, these policies are frequently static. For instance, ChatGPT Deep Research always asks single round of clarifying questions before searching (Deng et al., 2025), and coding agents like SWE-agent (Yang et al., 2024) start by reading through an existing codebase. This contrasts Calibrate-Then-Act: Cost-Aware Exploration in LLM Agents with settings like Figure 1, where we see that model can act more efficiently if it has confidence that it understands the problem setup and appropriately trades off exploration against action costs. In this work, we ask: how can we develop LLMs that explore in Pareto-optimal way under varying cost and uncertainty profiles? Leveraging the strong reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs, we propose framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), which decouples the calibration of uncertainty from the reasoning of action selection. The key insight is that by presenting priors explicitly to the model, we induce the model to reason about an underlying sequential decision-making problem abstractly and discover the optimal action. We first study synthetic task to illustrate this. On these Pandoras Box problems (Weitzman, 1979), an agent faces multiple hidden boxes with known prior reward distributions and must decide which boxes to open (each incurring cost) and when to stop and commit to the best observed option. Even small thinking model (Qwen3-8B) can compute the optimal action. We then study two more realistic settings: (1) knowledge QA with optional retrieval, where uncertainty is inferred from the models own confidence; and (2) coding tasks where priors regarding environmental structure (e.g., file schemas) are derived from cues learned through past experience. Feeding calibration information via prompt (CTA-PROMPTED) enables dynamic decision-making that is lacking from basic LLMs. Crucially, this behavior does not emerge from basic RL alone: an LLM trained with RL on the coding task fails to internalize the relevant priors from end-to-end training and does not reliably adopt the correct adaptive strategy. In contrast, CTA explicitly exposes these priors to the policy and can be combined with RL to yield further, consistent performance gains. Our contributions are: (1) Framing environment exploration as sequential decision-making problem; (2) Introducing Calibrate-Then-Act, which induces LLMs to reason about the optimality of their actions and achieve better costperformance tradeoffs than baselines. spaces; LLMs produce string actions (code, API calls, etc.) and receive string-valued responses from the environment. The observation function produces string realizations of the underlying environment; e.g., in Figure 1, the results of executing commands return string output in the terminal reflecting the underlying state of the environment. The environment contains problem-critical unobserved features that will determine the agents performance, e.g., details about the formatting of the unobserved file in Figure 1. These can be thought of as subset of the information in . We represent these as random variable taking values . The agent interac"

We present CrispEdit, scalable and principled second-order editing algorithm that treats capability preservation as an explicit constraint, unifying and generalizing several existing editing approaches. CrispEdit formulates editing as constrained optimization and enforces the constraint by projecting edit updates onto the low-curvature subspace of the capability-loss landscape. At the crux of CrispEdit is expressing capability constraint via Bregman divergence, whose quadratic form yields the GaussNewton Hessian exactly and even when the base model is not trained to convergence. We make this second-order procedure efficient at the LLM scale using Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (K-FAC) and novel matrix-free projector that exploits Kronecker structure to avoid constructing massive projection matrices. Across standard model-editing benchmarks, CrispEdit achieves high edit success while keeping capability degradation below 1% on average across datasets, significantly improving over prior editors.

Large language models can be improved for complex tasks by explicitly reasoning about cost-uncertainty tradeoffs through a Calibrate-Then-Act framework that enhances decision-making in sequential environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 LLMs are increasingly being used for complex problems which are not necessarily resolved in a single response, but require interacting with an environment to acquire information. In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA. Our results on information-seeking QA and on a simplified coding task show that making cost-benefit tradeoffs explicit with CTA can help agents discover more optimal decision-making strategies.

CrispEdit is a second-order editing algorithm for large language models that preserves capabilities by constraining updates to low-curvature subspaces of the capability-loss landscape using Bregman divergence and efficient Kronecker-factored approximations.  					AI-generated summary 				 A central challenge in large language model (LLM) editing is capability preservation: methods that successfully change targeted behavior can quietly game the editing proxy and corrupt general capabilities, producing degenerate behaviors reminiscent of proxy/reward hacking. We present CrispEdit, a scalable and principled second-order editing algorithm that treats capability preservation as an explicit constraint, unifying and generalizing several existing editing approaches. CrispEdit formulates editing as constrained optimization and enforces the constraint by projecting edit updates onto the low-curvature subspace of the capability-loss landscape. At the crux of CrispEdit is expressing capability constraint via Bregman divergence, whose quadratic form yields the Gauss-Newton Hessian exactly and even when the base model is not trained to convergence. We make this second-order procedure efficient at the LLM scale using Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (K-FAC) and a novel matrix-free projector that exploits Kronecker structure to avoid constructing massive projection matrices. Across standard model-editing benchmarks, CrispEdit achieves high edit success while keeping capability degradation below 1% on average across datasets, significantly improving over prior editors.

"CrispEdit is a second-order editing algorithm for large language models that preserves capabilities by constraining updates to low-curvature subspaces of the capability-loss landscape using Bregman divergence and efficient Kronecker-factored approximations.  					AI-generated summary 				 A central challenge in large language model (LLM) editing is capability preservation: methods that successfully change targeted behavior can quietly game the editing proxy and corrupt general capabilities, producing degenerate behaviors reminiscent of proxy/reward hacking. We present CrispEdit, a scalable and principled second-order editing algorithm that treats capability preservation as an explicit constraint, unifying and generalizing several existing editing approaches. CrispEdit formulates editing as constrained optimization and enforces the constraint by projecting edit updates onto the low-curvature subspace of the capability-loss landscape. At the crux of CrispEdit is expressing capability constraint via Bregman divergence, whose quadratic form yields the Gauss-Newton Hessian exactly and even when the base model is not trained to convergence. We make this second-order procedure efficient at the LLM scale using Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (K-FAC) and a novel matrix-free projector that exploits Kronecker structure to avoid constructing massive projection matrices. Across standard model-editing benchmarks, CrispEdit achieves high edit success while keeping capability degradation below 1% on average across datasets, significantly improving over prior editors."

**Reasoning:**

1. **OPTIMIZATION**: The paper presents CrispEdit, a second-order editing algorithm that uses constrained optimization, Bregman divergence, Kronecker-factored approximations, and efficient optimization techniques (K-FAC, matrix-free projector) to improve training/editing procedures for LLMs.

2. **ALIGNMENT**: The paper addresses capability preservation and preventing "degenerate behaviors reminiscent of proxy/reward hacking" when editing LLMs. This is fundamentally about aligning model behavior - ensuring that edits to targeted behavior don't corrupt the model's general capabilities and intended behavior, which is a core alignment concern.
