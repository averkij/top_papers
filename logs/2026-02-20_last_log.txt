Text:"Version 1.5 Frontier AI Risk Management Framework in Practice: Risk Analysis Technical Report Version 1.5. Last updated: 15th, February, 2026 Dongrui Liu, Yi Yu, Jie Zhang, Guanxu Chen, Qihao Lin, Hanxi Zhu, Lige Huang, Yijin Zhou, Peng Wang, Shuai Shao, Boxuan Zhang, Zicheng Liu, Jingwei Sun, Yu Li, Yuejin Xie, Jiaxuan Guo, Jia Xu, Chaochao Lu, Bowen Zhou, Xia Hu(cid:66), Jing Shao(cid:66)To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) models, Frontier AI Risk Management Framework in Practice (F1 et al., 2025) presents comprehensive assessment of their frontier risks. As Large Language Models (LLMs) general capabilities rapidly evolve and the proliferation of agentic AI, this version of the risk analysis technical report presents an updated and granular assessment of five critical dimensions: cyber offense, persuasion and manipulation, strategic deception, uncontrolled AI R&D, and self-replication. Specifically, we introduce more complex scenarios for cyber offense. For persuasion and manipulation, we evaluate the risk of LLM-to-LLM persuasion on newly released LLMs. For strategic deception and scheming, we add the new experiment with respect to emergent misalignment. For uncontrolled AI R&D, we focus on the mis-evolution of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we also monitor and evaluate the safety performance of OpenClaw during the interaction on the Moltbook. For self-replication, we introduce new resource-constrained scenario. More importantly, we propose and validate series of robust mitigation strategies to address these emerging threats, providing preliminary technical and actionable pathway for the secure deployment of frontier AI. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges. 6 2 0 2 6 1 ] .

These breakthroughs have sparked lively conversation about the frontier risks of AI (Anthropic, 2023; OpenAI, 2025a; Google, 2025b; METR, 2023; Phuong et al., 2024), i.e., high-severity risks associated with general-purpose AI models. With the rapid development and deployment of advanced AIs, we need comprehensive and practical identification and evaluation of their underlying risks, along with developing effective mitigation strategies. Frontier AI Risk Management Framework in Practice (v1.0) (F1 et al., 2025) conducts comprehensive assessment of AIs frontier risks that could potentially pose significant threats to public health, national security, and societal stability due to their potential for rapid escalation, severe societal harm, and unprecedented scope of impact. Specifically, we evaluate critical risks across seven key areas: (1) cyber offense, (2) biological and chemical risks, (3) persuasion and manipulation, (4) strategic deception and scheming, (5) uncontrolled autonomous AI R&D, (6) self-replication, and (7) collusion. In this new version, we conduct more comprehensive and granular assessment of the frontier risks associated with recent state-of-the-art models by systematically updating our evaluation across five critical dimensions, as shown in Table 1. Specifically, we introduce 17 complex scenarios to the PACEbench benchmark to reveal the nuanced exploitation capabilities of frontier models within high-fidelity environments for cyber offense. For persuasion and manipulation, we observe that contemporary reasoning models demonstrate significantly enhanced capabilities compared to previous generations, exposing critical safety risks. For strategic deception and scheming, our findings reveal high sensitivity to data veracity, where even marginal contamination of 1-5% is sufficient to trigger cross-domain dishonesty. For uncontrolled AI R&D, we focus on the mis-evolution of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we monitor and evaluate potential risks arising from autonomous agent"

Text:"SpargeAttention2: Trainable Sparse Attention via Hybrid Top-k+Top-p Masking and Distillation Fine-Tuning Jintao Zhang * 1 Kai Jiang * 1 Chendong Xiang * 1 Weiqi Feng 1 Yuezhou Hu 2 Haocheng Xi 2 Jianfei Chen 1 Jun ZhuMany training-free sparse attention methods are effective for accelerating diffusion models. Recently, several works suggest that making sparse attention trainable can further increase sparsity while preserving generation quality. We study three key questions: (1) when do the two common masking rules, i.e., Top-k and Top-p, fail, and how can we avoid these failures? (2) why can trainable sparse attention reach higher sparsity than training-free methods? (3) what are the limitations of fine-tuning sparse attention using the diffusion loss, and how can we address them? Based on this analysis, we propose SpargeAttention2, trainable sparse attention method that achieves high sparsity without degrading generation quality. SpargeAttention2 includes (i) hybrid masking rule that combines Top-k and Top-p for more robust masking at high sparsity, (ii) an efficient trainable sparse attention implementation, and (iii) distillation-inspired fine-tuning objective to better preserve generation quality during fine-tuning using sparse attention. Experiments on video diffusion models show that SpargeAttention2 reaches 95% attention sparsity and 16.2 attention speedup while maintaining generation quality, consistently outperforming prior sparse attention methods. 6 2 0 2 3 1 ] . [ 1 5 1 5 3 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r 1. Introduction Motivation and core problem. Attention efficiency in video diffusion models (Blattmann et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Kong et al., 2024; Wan et al., 2025) is critical because of their long sequence length and O(N 2) time complexity of the attention operator. Sparse attention has been shown to work well in diffusion models. For example, SpargeAttention (Zhang et al., 2025f), SVG (Xi et al., *Equal contribution 1Tsinghua University 2UC Berkeley. Preprint. 1 2025), and other training-free sparse attention methods (Li et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025a) can save certain portion of attention computation for video generation. More recently, studies show that trainable sparse attention (Zhang et al., 2025c;i; Wu et al., 2025; Zhan et al., 2025) can achieve even higher sparsity after pre-training or fine-tuning. The core points of sparse attention methods are (i) designing reasonable sparse masker, i.e., selecting which tokens in the query, key, and value participate in the computation. For trainable sparse attention, it further requires (ii) an efficient, trainable sparse-attention kernel implementation, and (iii) suitable training objective that enables the trained sparse attention to maintain high generation quality under high sparsity. In this work, we mainly focus on these three aspects. Limitation. Current trainable sparse attention methods have two main limitations. (L1) Under very high attention sparsity (e.g., > 90%), we observe that both Top-k and Top-p maskers can fail to preserve the most important attention computation. This is closely related to the distribution of each row of the attention weights matrix (P ), which is often either (i) relatively uniform or (ii) highly skewed. With Top-k masker, if the row is close to uniform, the probability is spread over many tokens. Then, keeping fixed tokens captures only small fraction of the total probability, which may miss useful context. With Top-p masker, highly skewed row may satisfy the cumulative-probability threshold with only few tokens; these tokens can be dominated by attention sinks (Xiao et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2024), causing other informative tokens to be dropped. (L2) Most existing sparse attention methods fine-tune video diffusion models using promptvideo pairs collected from real-world sources and optimize the standard diffusion loss. However, in practice, this setting is problematic for widely used opensource video diffusion models, whose pre-training datasets are typically not publicly available (e.g., Wan2.1 (Wan et al., 2025)). As result, it is difficult for the community to collect fine-tuning data that matches the distribution of the original pre-training data. In this setting, even fine-tuning with full attention can noticeably degrade performance relative to the original model. This is because the diffusion loss is data-driven and forces the model to fit the fine-tuning dataset, which is typically lower quality than the original SpargeAttention2: Trainable Sparse Attention via Hybrid Top-k+Top-p masking and Distillation Fine-Tuning Figure 1. Qualitative examples of text-to-video generation. We compare the original full-attention model with SpargeAttention2 under high attention sparsity. SpargeAttention2 preserves visual quality, temporal coherence, and textvideo alignment comparable to full attention, while substantially reducing attention computation. The prompts used for generation is in Appendix training data. Our approach. We propose SpargeAttention2, an accurate and efficient trainable sparse attention method for diffusion models. To address (L1), we analyze how Top-k and Top-p masking affect the information preserved by sparse attention, especially at very high sparsity. Based on this analysis, we propose simple and effective unified masker that combines Top-k and Top-p, and works well for both uniform and skewed attention weight distributions. To address (L2), inspired by distillation, we introduce velocity-level distillation loss that aligns the model using sparse attention with frozen full-attention model during fine-tuning. Specifically, the velocity distillation loss uses the output of the full-attention model as the supervision signal, which helps maintain the original generation quality even when the fine-tuning data distribution differs from the pre-training distribution. This design matches the goal of trainable sparse attention, which aims to preserve generation quality while pushing sparsity as high as possible. In contrast, conventional fine-tuning typically aims to enhance or specialize model capabilities. Result. SpargeAttention2 achieves 95% attention sparsity, 16.2 attention runtime speedup, and up to 4.7 end-toend video generation speedup while maintaining the endto-end generation quality comparable to full attention, as shown in Figure 1.

[ 1 0 7 2 7 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Unified Latents (UL): How to train your latents Jonathan Heek1, Emiel Hoogeboom1, Thomas Mensink1 and Tim Salimans1 1Google DeepMind Amsterdam We present Unified Latents (UL), framework for learning latent representations that are jointly regularized by diffusion prior and decoded by diffusion model. By linking the encoders output noise to the priors minimum noise level, we obtain simple training objective that provides tight upper bound on the latent bitrate. On ImageNet-512, our approach achieves competitive FID of 1.4, with high reconstruction quality (PSNR) while requiring fewer training FLOPs than models trained on Stable Diffusion latents. On Kinetics-600, we set new state-of-the-art FVD of 1.3. 1. Introduction Diffusion models have become remarkably successful for image, video, and audio generation. An important factor in this success has been latent representations, compact encodings that allow diffusion models to scale to higher resolutions more efficiently. However, it remains unclear how best to learn such latents. The original Latent Diffusion Model (Rombach et al., 2022) uses VAE-style KL penalty between the latent distribution and standard Gaussian. Since the decoder lacks likelihood-based loss, the weight of the KL term must be set manually, making it difficult to reason about the information content of the latents. Recently, works have focused on getting semantic representations from either pretrained networks (e.g. from DINO) or heavily regularized autoencoders. These latents are usually easier to learn due to their lower information density and obtain impressive FIDs. However, high frequency information typically gets lost, which can be seen by worse PSNRs or heavy reconstruction artifacts. Simply put, there is trade-off between the information content of the latent, and the reconstruction quality of the output. If the structure of the latent is easier to learn, this generally leads to better generation p"

Text:"6 2 0 2 8 1 ] . [ 1 8 2 9 6 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r a Zun Li1, John Schultz1, Daniel Hennes1 and Marc Lanctot1 1Google DeepMind 2026-2-20 Much of the advancement of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in imperfect-information games has historically depended on manual iterative refinement of baselines. While foundational families like Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) rest on solid theoretical ground, the design of their most effective variants often relies on human intuition to navigate vast algorithmic design space. In this work, we propose the use of AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent powered by large language models, to automatically discover new multiagent learning algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by evolving novel variants for two distinct paradigms of game-theoretic learning. First, in the domain of iterative regret minimization, we evolve the logic governing regret accumulation and policy derivation, discovering new algorithm, VolatilityAdaptive Discounted (VAD-)CFR. VAD-CFR employs novel, non-intuitive mechanismsincluding volatilitysensitive discounting, consistency-enforced optimism, and hard warm-start policy accumulation scheduleto outperform state-of-the-art baselines like Discounted Predictive CFR+. Second, in the regime of population based training algorithms, we evolve training-time and evaluation-time meta strategy solvers for PSRO, discovering new variant, Smoothed Hybrid Optimistic Regret (SHOR-)PSRO. SHOR-PSRO introduces hybrid meta-solver that linearly blends Optimistic Regret Matching with smoothed, temperature-controlled distribution over best pure strategies. By dynamically annealing this blending factor and diversity bonuses during training, the algorithm automates the transition from population diversity to rigorous equilibrium finding, yielding superior empirical convergence compared to standard static meta-solvers.

[ 1 9 7 5 3 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Fig. 1: We propose TactAlign, cross-sensor tactile alignment method for cross-embodiment human-to-robot policy transfer. Given unpaired human (tactile glove) and robot demonstrations, TactAlign uses rectified flow to map glove tactile features into the robot tactile space. This alignment enables effective tactile policy co-training on pivoting, insertion, and lid closing tasks. With only few minutes of human demonstrations, the resulting policies generalize to unseen objects instances. Importantly, the same learned alignment can be reused to train policies on unseen tasks. We also demonstrate zero-shot human-to-robot dexterous manipulation on light bulb screwing task. AbstractHuman demonstrations collected by wearable devices (e.g., tactile gloves) provide fast and dexterous supervision for policy learning, and are guided by rich, natural tactile feedback. However, key challenge is how to transfer humancollected tactile signals to robots despite the differences in sensing modalities and embodiment. Existing human-to-robot (H2R) approaches that incorporate touch often assume identical tactile sensors, require paired data, and involve little to no embodiment gap between human demonstrator and the robots, limiting scalability and generality. We propose TactAlign, crossembodiment tactile alignment method that transfers humancollected tactile signals to robot with different embodiment. TactAlign transforms human and robot tactile observations into shared latent representation using rectified flow, without paired datasets, manual lab"

Frontier AI risk analysis assesses critical dimensions including cyber offense, persuasion and manipulation, strategic deception, uncontrolled AI R&D, and self-replication, proposing mitigation strategies for secure deployment of advanced AI systems.  					AI-generated summary 				 To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) models, Frontier AI Risk Management Framework in Practice presents a comprehensive assessment of their frontier risks. As Large Language Models (LLMs) general capabilities rapidly evolve and the proliferation of agentic AI, this version of the risk analysis technical report presents an updated and granular assessment of five critical dimensions: cyber offense, persuasion and manipulation, strategic deception, uncontrolled AI R\&D, and self-replication. Specifically, we introduce more complex scenarios for cyber offense. For persuasion and manipulation, we evaluate the risk of LLM-to-LLM persuasion on newly released LLMs. For strategic deception and scheming, we add the new experiment with respect to emergent misalignment. For uncontrolled AI R\&D, we focus on the ``mis-evolution'' of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we also monitor and evaluate the safety performance of OpenClaw during the interaction on the Moltbook. For self-replication, we introduce a new resource-constrained scenario. More importantly, we propose and validate a series of robust mitigation strategies to address these emerging threats, providing a preliminary technical and actionable pathway for the secure deployment of frontier AI. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.

A trainable sparse attention method called SpargeAttention2 is proposed that achieves high sparsity in diffusion models while maintaining generation quality through hybrid masking rules and distillation-inspired fine-tuning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Many training-free sparse attention methods are effective for accelerating diffusion models. Recently, several works suggest that making sparse attention trainable can further increase sparsity while preserving generation quality. We study three key questions: (1) when do the two common masking rules, i.e., Top-k and Top-p, fail, and how can we avoid these failures? (2) why can trainable sparse attention reach higher sparsity than training-free methods? (3) what are the limitations of fine-tuning sparse attention using the diffusion loss, and how can we address them? Based on this analysis, we propose SpargeAttention2, a trainable sparse attention method that achieves high sparsity without degrading generation quality. SpargeAttention2 includes (i) a hybrid masking rule that combines Top-k and Top-p for more robust masking at high sparsity, (ii) an efficient trainable sparse attention implementation, and (iii) a distillation-inspired fine-tuning objective to better preserve generation quality during fine-tuning using sparse attention. Experiments on video diffusion models show that SpargeAttention2 reaches 95% attention sparsity and a 16.2x attention speedup while maintaining generation quality, consistently outperforming prior sparse attention methods.

Experiments on video diffusion models show that SpargeAttention2 reaches 95% attention sparsity and a 16.2x attention speedup while maintaining generation quality, consistently outperforming prior sparse attention methods."

Unified Latents framework learns joint latent representations using diffusion prior regularization and diffusion model decoding, achieving competitive FID scores with reduced training compute.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Unified Latents (UL), a framework for learning latent representations that are jointly regularized by a diffusion prior and decoded by a diffusion model. By linking the encoder's output noise to the prior's minimum noise level, we obtain a simple training objective that provides a tight upper bound on the latent bitrate. On ImageNet-512, our approach achieves competitive FID of 1.4, with high reconstruction quality (PSNR) while requiring fewer training FLOPs than models trained on Stable Diffusion latents. On Kinetics-600, we set a new state-of-the-art FVD of 1.3.

Dynamic tokenization improves diffusion transformer efficiency by adjusting patch sizes based on content complexity and denoising timestep, achieving significant speedup without quality loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image and video generation, but their success comes at the cost of heavy computation. This inefficiency is largely due to the fixed tokenization process, which uses constant-sized patches throughout the entire denoising phase, regardless of the content's complexity. We propose dynamic tokenization, an efficient test-time strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and the denoising timestep. Our key insight is that early timesteps only require coarser patches to model global structure, while later iterations demand finer (smaller-sized) patches to refine local details. During inference, our method dynamically reallocates patch sizes across denoising steps for image and video generation and substantially reduces cost while preserving perceptual generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: it achieves up to 3.52times and 3.2times speedup on FLUX-1.Dev and Wan 2.1, respectively, without compromising the generation quality and prompt adherence.

A world model for desktop software that predicts UI state changes through textual description followed by visual synthesis, improving decision quality and execution robustness in computer-using tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Agents operating in complex software environments benefit from reasoning about the consequences of their actions, as even a single incorrect user interface (UI) operation can derail long, artifact-preserving workflows. This challenge is particularly acute for computer-using scenarios, where real execution does not support counterfactual exploration, making large-scale trial-and-error learning and planning impractical despite the environment being fully digital and deterministic. We introduce the Computer-Using World Model (CUWM), a world model for desktop software that predicts the next UI state given the current state and a candidate action. CUWM adopts a two-stage factorization of UI dynamics: it first predicts a textual description of agent-relevant state changes, and then realizes these changes visually to synthesize the next screenshot. CUWM is trained on offline UI transitions collected from agents interacting with real Microsoft Office applications, and further refined with a lightweight reinforcement learning stage that aligns textual transition predictions with the structural requirements of computer-using environments. We evaluate CUWM via test-time action search, where a frozen agent uses the world model to simulate and compare candidate actions before execution. Across a range of Office tasks, world-model-guided test-time scaling improves decision quality and execution robustness.

**Justification:**

- **REASONING**: The paper explicitly discusses enhancing reasoning capabilities through a world model that allows agents to "reason about the consequences of their actions" and perform "test-time action search" to "simulate and compare candidate actions before execution." This is fundamentally about improving logical reasoning in decision-making.

- **OPTIMIZATION**: The paper mentions "test-time scaling" and uses "reinforcement learning" for refinement, which are optimization techniques to improve model performance and decision quality.

Researchers enhance linear attention by simplifying Mamba-2 and improving its architectural components to achieve near-softmax accuracy while maintaining memory efficiency for long sequences.  					AI-generated summary 				 Linear attention transformers have become a strong alternative to softmax attention due to their efficiency. However, linear attention tends to be less expressive and results in reduced accuracy compared to softmax attention. To bridge the accuracy gap between softmax attention and linear attention, we manipulate Mamba-2, a very strong linear attention variant. We first simplify Mamba-2 down to its most fundamental and important components, evaluating which specific choices make it most accurate. From this simplified Mamba variant (Mamba-2S), we improve the A-mask and increase the order of the hidden state, resulting in a method, which we call 2Mamba, that is nearly as accurate as softmax attention, yet much more memory efficient for long context lengths. We also investigate elements to Mamba-2 that help surpass softmax attention accuracy. Code is provided for all our experiments

AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent using large language models, automatically discovers new multiagent learning algorithms for imperfect-information games by evolving regret minimization and population-based training variants.  					AI-generated summary 				 Much of the advancement of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in imperfect-information games has historically depended on manual iterative refinement of baselines. While foundational families like Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) rest on solid theoretical ground, the design of their most effective variants often relies on human intuition to navigate a vast algorithmic design space. In this work, we propose the use of AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent powered by large language models, to automatically discover new multiagent learning algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by evolving novel variants for two distinct paradigms of game-theoretic learning. First, in the domain of iterative regret minimization, we evolve the logic governing regret accumulation and policy derivation, discovering a new algorithm, Volatility-Adaptive Discounted (VAD-)CFR. VAD-CFR employs novel, non-intuitive mechanisms-including volatility-sensitive discounting, consistency-enforced optimism, and a hard warm-start policy accumulation schedule-to outperform state-of-the-art baselines like Discounted Predictive CFR+. Second, in the regime of population based training algorithms, we evolve training-time and evaluation-time meta strategy solvers for PSRO, discovering a new variant, Smoothed Hybrid Optimistic Regret (SHOR-)PSRO. SHOR-PSRO introduces a hybrid meta-solver that linearly blends Optimistic Regret Matching with a smoothed, temperature-controlled distribution over best pure strategies. By dynamically annealing this blending factor and diversity bonuses during training, the algorithm automates the transition from population diversity to rigorous equilibrium finding, yielding superior empirical convergence compared to standard static meta-solvers.

TactAlign enables transfer of human tactile demonstrations to robots with different embodiments through cross-embodiment tactile alignment without requiring paired data or manual labels.  					AI-generated summary 				 Human demonstrations collected by wearable devices (e.g., tactile gloves) provide fast and dexterous supervision for policy learning, and are guided by rich, natural tactile feedback. However, a key challenge is how to transfer human-collected tactile signals to robots despite the differences in sensing modalities and embodiment. Existing human-to-robot (H2R) approaches that incorporate touch often assume identical tactile sensors, require paired data, and involve little to no embodiment gap between human demonstrator and the robots, limiting scalability and generality. We propose TactAlign, a cross-embodiment tactile alignment method that transfers human-collected tactile signals to a robot with different embodiment. TactAlign transforms human and robot tactile observations into a shared latent representation using a rectified flow, without paired datasets, manual labels, or privileged information. Our method enables low-cost latent transport guided by hand-object interaction-derived pseudo-pairs. We demonstrate that TactAlign improves H2R policy transfer across multiple contact-rich tasks (pivoting, insertion, lid closing), generalizes to unseen objects and tasks with human data (less than 5 minutes), and enables zero-shot H2R transfer on a highly dexterous tasks (light bulb screwing).

"TactAlign enables transfer of human tactile demonstrations to robots with different embodiments through cross-embodiment tactile alignment without requiring paired data or manual labels.  					AI-generated summary 				 Human demonstrations collected by wearable devices (e.g., tactile gloves) provide fast and dexterous supervision for policy learning, and are guided by rich, natural tactile feedback. However, a key challenge is how to transfer human-collected tactile signals to robots despite the differences in sensing modalities and embodiment. Existing human-to-robot (H2R) approaches that incorporate touch often assume identical tactile sensors, require paired data, and involve little to no embodiment gap between human demonstrator and the robots, limiting scalability and generality. We propose TactAlign, a cross-embodiment tactile alignment method that transfers human-collected tactile signals to a robot with different embodiment. TactAlign transforms human and robot tactile observations into a shared latent representation using a rectified flow, without paired datasets, manual labels, or privileged information. Our method enables low-cost latent transport guided by hand-object interaction-derived pseudo-pairs. We demonstrate that TactAlign improves H2R policy transfer across multiple contact-rich tasks (pivoting, insertion, lid closing), generalizes to unseen objects and tasks with human data (less than 5 minutes), and enables zero-shot H2R transfer on a highly dexterous tasks (light bulb screwing)."
