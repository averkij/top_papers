[ 1 2 0 6 4 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r The opioid epidemic continues to ravage communities worldwide, straining healthcare systems, disrupting families, and demanding urgent computational solutions. To combat this lethal opioid crisis, graph learning methods have emerged as promising paradigm for modeling complex drug-related phenomena. However, significant gap remains: there is no comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating these methods across real-world opioid crisis scenarios. This gap persists due to three key challenges: (i) the multidimensional nature of the crisis spanning the supply and demand sides of the drug ecosystem, (ii) the structural complexity of drugrelated data involving heterogeneous and higher-order interactions, and (iii) the scarcity of publicly available annotated datasets due to privacy constraints and labor-intensive expert labeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce Opbench, the first comprehensive opioid benchmark comprising five datasets across three critical application domains: opioid overdose detection from healthcare claims, illicit drug trafficking detection from digital platforms, and drug misuse prediction from dietary patterns. Specifically, Opbench incorporates diverse graph structures, including heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs, to preserve the rich and complex relational information among drug-related data. To address data scarcity, we collaborate with domain experts and authoritative institutions to curate and annotate datasets while adhering to privacy and ethical guidelines. Furthermore, we establish unified evaluation framework with standardized protocols, predefined data splits, and reproduci"

Prompt: Read an abstract of the ML paper and return a JSON with fields: 'desc': explanation of the paper in Russian (4 sentences), use correct machine learning terms.

The opioid epidemic continues to ravage communities worldwide, straining healthcare systems, disrupting families, and demanding urgent computational solutions. To combat this lethal opioid crisis, graph learning methods have emerged as a promising paradigm for modeling complex drug-related phenomena. However, a significant gap remains: there is no comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating these methods across real-world opioid crisis scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce OPBench, the first comprehensive opioid benchmark comprising five datasets across three critical application domains: opioid overdose detection from healthcare claims, illicit drug trafficking detection from digital platforms, and drug misuse prediction from dietary patterns. Specifically, OPBench incorporates diverse graph structures, including heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs, to preserve the rich and complex relational information among drug-related data. To address data scarcity, we collaborate with domain experts and authoritative institutions to curate and annotate datasets while adhering to privacy and ethical guidelines. Furthermore, we establish a unified evaluation framework with standardized protocols, predefined data splits, and reproducible baselines to facilitate fair and systematic comparison among graph learning methods. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the strengths and limitations of existing graph learning methods, thereby providing actionable insights for future research in combating the opioid crisis. Our source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Tianyi-Billy-Ma/OPBench.

Бенчмарк включает пять датасетов из трёх важных областей: обнаружение передозировок из медицинских данных, выявление незаконного оборота наркотиков в цифровых сетях и прогнозирование злоупотребления наркотиками по пищевым паттернам. Авторы используют гетерогенные графы и гиперграфы для сохранения сложных отношений в данных о наркотиках, а также устанавливают унифицированную оценочную систему с стандартизированными протоколами и воспроизводимыми базовыми моделями. Через экспериментальный анализ исследование выявляет сильные и слабые стороны существующих методов обучения на графах, предоставляя практические рекомендации для будущих исследований.",
