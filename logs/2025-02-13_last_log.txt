In the proposed scheme, the Qwen2-1.5B model is frozen, and its representations are passed through specially designed attention layers to the GPT-Neo-125M model, which is trained on limited computational resources. Experimental results obtained on the Bespoke-Stratos-17k dataset demonstrate that after 15 epochs of training, the combined model generates responses that are comparable in quality to models obtained by distillation. The paper discusses the advantages of the modular approach in detail, provides examples of input queries and their comparative analysis, and outlines prospects for further extension of the method. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in natural language processing tasks; however, their training and deployment require signiÔ¨Åcant computational resources. This has led to the need for methods that transfer knowledge from large pre-trained models to smaller models. Such approaches are especially relevant for applied tasks with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose modular LLM architecture in which large model serves as knowledge source, while smaller model receives external representations via Enhanced CrossAttention and generates responses.

In this work, we propose modular LLM architecture in which large model serves as knowledge source, while smaller model receives external representations via Enhanced CrossAttention and generates responses. This method signiÔ¨Åcantly reduces training costs while remaining eÔ¨Äective for solving speciÔ¨Åc business tasks.Knowledge distillation and adaptive transfer of representations are widely discussed in the literature [3, 1]. For instance, distillation works such as DistilBERT [4] and TinyBERT [5] show that it is possible to signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce model size without losing performance. Modern transfer learning approaches include the use of adapter modules [6] and methods like LoRA [7], which allow for the adaptation of large models with minimal number of trainable parameters. AdapterFusion [8] demonstrates the potential for non-destructive task composition during knowledge transfer. Additionally, the T5 work [9] explores the limits of transfer learning by unifying multiple tasks into single text-to-text format. Thus, the proposed methodology diÔ¨Äers in that, rather than relying on classic distillation, it transfers representations via specialized Cross-Attention layers, thereby preserving larger portion of the original models information and handling longer input sequences (e.g., 128K tokens in Qwen2 versus 2K tokens in GPT-Neo).The approach is based on two key components: Knowledge Source: large pre-trained model (e.g., Qwen2-1.5B) is used to extract rich representations of the input query. The models weights remain unchanged (frozen). Generation Module: small model (e.g., GPT-Neo-125M) receives external representations via Enhanced Cross-Attention layers and, combining them with its own computations, generates coherent response.The key component of the scheme is modiÔ¨Åed Cross-Attention layer, which consists of: 1. Linear projections that convert the representation dimensions of the large model (e.g., 1536) to the dimensions required by the small model (e.g., 768). 2. An Adapter Block that provides an additional non-linear transformation to adapt the representations. 3. Gating Mechanism that dynamically blends the original representations with the external knowledge. This approach eÔ¨Äectively "absorbs" knowledge from the source without the need to retrain the entire model."

However, parameter conflicts between models leads to performance degradation in averaging. While model routing addresses this issue by selecting individual models during inference, it imposes exce...

[13.02.2025 11:09] Abstract 19. We propose a novel dynamic safety framework that optimizes language model (LM) safety reasoning at inference time without modifying model weights. Building on recent advances in self-critique methods, our approach leverages a meta-critique mechanism that iteratively updates safety prompts-termed spe...

In this work, we propose an architecture of LLM Modules that enables the transfer of knowledge from a large pre-trained model to a smaller model using an Enhanced Cross-Attention mechanism. In the proposed scheme, the Qwen2-1.5B model is frozen and its representations are passed through specially designed attention layers to the GPT-Neo-125M model, which is trained on limited computational resources. Experimental results on the Bespoke-Stratos-17k dataset demonstrate that after 15 epochs of training, the combined model generates responses comparable in quality to those obtained by distillation. We discuss the advantages of the modular approach, provide examples of input queries and comparative analysis, and outline prospects for further extension of the method.

"In this work, we propose an architecture of LLM Modules that enables the transfer of knowledge from a large pre-trained model to a smaller model using an Enhanced Cross-Attention mechanism. In the proposed scheme, the Qwen2-1.5B model is frozen and its representations are passed through specially designed attention layers to the GPT-Neo-125M model, which is trained on limited computational resources. Experimental results on the Bespoke-Stratos-17k dataset demonstrate that after 15 epochs of training, the combined model generates responses comparable in quality to those obtained by distillation. We discuss the advantages of the modular approach, provide examples of input queries and comparative analysis, and outline prospects for further extension of the method."
