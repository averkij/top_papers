Text:"PDE-Controller: LLMs for Autoformalization and Reasoning of PDEs Mauricio Soroco * 1 Jialin Song * 1 Mengzhou Xia 2 Kye Emond 3 4 Weiran Sun 3 Wuyang Chen 1 5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 3 6 9 0 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract While recent AI-for-math has made strides in pure mathematics, areas of applied mathematics, particularly PDEs, remain underexplored despite their significant real-world applications. We present PDE-Controller, framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to control systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach enables LLMs to transform informal natural language instructions into formal specifications, and then execute reasoning and planning steps to improve the utility of PDE control. We build holistic solution comprising datasets (both human-written cases and 2 million synthetic samples), math-reasoning models, and novel evaluation metrics, all of which require significant effort. Our PDE-Controller significantly outperforms prompting the latest opensource and GPT models in reasoning, autoformalization, and program synthesis, achieving up to 62% improvement in utility gain for PDE control. By bridging the gap between language generation and PDE systems, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs in addressing complex scientific and engineering challenges. We will release all data, model checkpoints, and code at https: //pde-controller.github.io/. 1. Introduction Recent advancements have significantly enhanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) (McKinzie et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2023). LLMs possess pretrained common knowledge and solves daily life tasks that require commonsense reasoning without domain-specific expertise. However, this reliance on generalized knowledge exposes significant weaknesses in complex domains. LLMs struggle with precise mathematical reasoning (Mirzadeh et al., *Equal contribution 1School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University 2Department of Computer Science, Princeton University 3Departmen"

While recent AI-for-math has made strides in pure mathematics, areas of applied mathematics, particularly PDEs, remain underexplored despite their significant real-world applications. We present PDE-Controller, a framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to control systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach enables LLMs to transform informal natural language instructions into formal specifications, and then execute reasoning and planning steps to improve the utility of PDE control. We build a holistic solution comprising datasets (both human-written cases and 2 million synthetic samples), math-reasoning models, and novel evaluation metrics, all of which require significant effort. Our PDE-Controller significantly outperforms prompting the latest open-source and GPT models in reasoning, autoformalization, and program synthesis, achieving up to a 62% improvement in utility gain for PDE control. By bridging the gap between language generation and PDE systems, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs in addressing complex scientific and engineering challenges. We will release all data, model checkpoints, and code at https://pde-controller.github.io/.

Этот подход позволяет LLM преобразовывать неформальные инструкции на естественном языке в формальные спецификации, а затем выполнять рассуждения и планирование для улучшения управления PDE. Авторы создали комплексное решение, включающее наборы данных, модели для математических рассуждений и новые метрики оценки. PDE-Controller значительно превосходит существующие модели в рассуждениях, автоформализации и синтезе программ, демонстрируя потенциал LLM в решении сложных научных и инженерных задач.",
