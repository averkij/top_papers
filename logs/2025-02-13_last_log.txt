[ 1 0 7 8 7 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aText-conditioned image generation has gained significant attention in recent years and are processing increasingly longer and comprehensive text prompt. In everyday life, dense and intricate text appears in contexts like advertisements, infographics, and signage, where the integration of both text and visuals is essential for conveying complex information. However, despite these advances, the generation of images containing long-form text remains persistent challenge, largely due to the limitations of existing datasets, which often focus on shorter and simpler text. To address this gap, we introduce TextAtlas5M, novel dataset specifically designed to evaluate long-text rendering in text-conditioned image generation. Our dataset consists of 5 million longtext generated and collected images across diverse data types, enabling comprehensive evaluation of large-scale generative models on longtext image generation. We further curate 3000 human-improved test set TextAtlasEval across 3 data domains, establishing one of the most extensive benchmarks for text-conditioned generation. Evaluations suggest that the TextAtlasEval benchmarks present significant challenges even for the most advanced proprietary models (e.g. GPT4o with DallE-3), while their open-source counterparts show an even larger performance gap. These evidences position TextAtlas5M as valuable dataset for training and evaluating future-generation text-conditioned image generation models. Datasets are released. 1. Introduction Text-conditioned image generation is processing inputs of longer texts, with growth in processing inputs of longer contexts from 77 text tokens in Dall-E (Ramesh et al., 2021a) to 300 text tokens in PixArt-α (Chen et al., 2023c), and 1Central South University 2North University of China 3Microsoft 4National University of Singapore. Figure 1: comparison of TextAtlas5M with previous text-rich image datasets (Schuhmann et al., 2022; Tuo et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024b). Unlike prior datasets with short or unstructured alt-text, TextAtlas5M features more diverse, complex long-form text. recently achieving 2,000-token capacity in autoregressive architectures (Team, 2024). In this regard, the task of generating comprehensive and controllable images with longer text input, such as image with complex layout or dense text, is considered promising testbed. Text plays central role in image generation, serving as one of the most pervasive elements in visual communication through news, books, advertisements, and more. For instance, over 50% of images in large-scale image generation datasets like LAION-2B (Schuhmann et al., 2022) contain text detectable by OCR models (Lin et al., 2025). However, despite the increasing prevalence of dense text in real-world scenarios, state-of-the-art models such as SDXL3 (Esser et al., 2024), DallE-3 (Betker et al., 2023) and Chameleon (Team, 2024) struggle with tasks requiring the generation of dense text (see Appendix for examples). This limitation stems from the reliance on existing text-rich image datasets like Marion10M and AnyWords3M (Tuo et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023a), which focus on short and simple text, failing to meet the demand for handling longer and more intricate inputs. Such limitations are particularly evident in practical scenariosranging from advertising TextAtlas5M: Large-scale Dataset for Dense Text Image Generation Table 1: Dataset Comparison with Existing Text-Rich Image Generation Datasets. The last two columns detail the sources of automatically generated labels, while the final column presents the average text token length derived from OCR applied to the images.

To address these challenges, we introduce TextAtlas5M, comprehensive dataset designed to advance and evaluate text-to-image generation models, with particular focus on generating dense-text images. As illustrated in Figure 1 and Table 1, TextAtlas5M stands out in several key ways compared to previous text-rich datasets. Unlike earlier datasets, which primarily focus on short and simple text, TextAtlas5M includes diverse and complex range of data. It spans from interleaved documents and synthetic data to realworld images containing dense text, offering more varied and challenging set of examples. Moreover, our dataset features longer text captions, which pose additional challenges for models, and includes human annotations for particularly difficult examples, ensuring more thorough evaluation of model capabilities. The synthetic subset progresses through three levels of complexity, starting with simple text on clean backgrounds. It then advances to interleaved data, blending text with visual elements, and culminates in synthetic natural images, where realistic scenes integrate seamlessly with text. The real image subset captures diverse, real-world densetext scenarios. It includes filtered samples from datasets like AnyText (Tuo et al., 2023) and TextDiffuser (Chen et al., 2024b), detailed descriptions from PowerPoint slides, book covers, and academic PDF papers. To enrich diversity, we also gather dense-text images guided by predefined topics from CommonCrawl1 and LAION-5B (Schuhmann et al., 2022). To assess the capability of model in dense text image generation, we introduce dedicated test set, TextAtlasEval, designed for comprehensive evaluation. This test set spans four distinct data types, ensuring diversity across domains and enhancing the relevance of TextAtlas5M for real-world applications.

Text:"NOLIMA: Long-Context Evaluation Beyond Literal Matching Ali Modarressi 1 2 * Hanieh Deilamsalehy 3 Franck Dernoncourt 3 Trung Bui 3 Ryan Rossi 3 Seunghyun Yoon 3 Hinrich Sch utze 1 2 Abstract Recent large language models (LLMs) support long contexts ranging from 128K to 1M tokens. popular method for evaluating these capabilities is the needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test, which involves retrieving needle (relevant information) from haystack (long irrelevant context). Extensions of this approach include increasing distractors, fact chaining, and in-context reasoning. However, in these benchmarks, models can exploit existing literal matches between the needle and haystack to simplify the task. To address this, we introduce NOLIMA, benchmark extending NIAH with carefully designed needle set, where questions and needles have minimal lexical overlap, requiring models to infer latent associations to locate the needle within the haystack. We evaluate 12 popular LLMs that claim to support contexts of at least 128K tokens. While they perform well in short contexts (<1K), performance degrades significantly as context length increases. At 32K, for instance, 10 models drop below 50% of their strong short-length baselines. Even GPT4o, one of the top-performing exceptions, experiences reduction from an almost-perfect baseline of 99.3% to 69.7%. Our analysis suggests these declines stem from the increased difficulty the attention mechanism faces in longer contexts when literal matches are absent, making it harder to retrieve relevant information. 5 2 0 2 7 ] .

Text:"LASP-2: Rethinking Sequence Parallelism for Linear Attention and Its Hybrid Weigao Sun 1 Disen Lan 1 2 Yiran Zhong 1 Xiaoye Qu 1 Yu Cheng1. Introduction 5 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 3 6 5 7 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Linear sequence modeling approaches, such as linear attention, provide advantages like linear-time training and constant-memory inference over sequence lengths. However, existing sequence parallelism (SP) methods are either not optimized for the right-product-first feature of linear attention or use ring-style communication strategy, which results in lower computation parallelism, limits their scalability for longer sequences in distributed systems. In this paper, we introduce LASP-2, new SP method to enhance both communication and computation parallelism when training linear attention transformer models with very-long input sequences. Compared to previous work LASP, LASP-2 rethinks the minimal communication requirement for SP on linear attention layers, reorganizes the whole communication-computation workflow of LASP. In this way, only one single AllGather collective communication is needed on intermediate memory states, whose sizes are independent of the sequence length, leading to significant improvements of both communication and computation parallelism, as well as their overlap. Additionally, we extend LASP-2 to LASP2H by applying similar communication redesign to standard attention modules, offering an efficient SP solution for hybrid models that blend linear and standard attention layers. Our evaluation on Linear-Llama3 model, variant of Llama3 with linear attention replacing standard attention, demonstrates the effectiveness of LASP2 and LASP-2H. Specifically, LASP-2 achieves training speed improvements of 15.2% over LASP and 36.6% over Ring Attention, with sequence length of 2048K across 64 GPUs.

Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 originally introduced by Vaswani Transformer, et al. (Vaswani et al., 2017), has become the backbone of modern models across wide range of domains, including language, vision, audio, video, graphs, and even time-series data (Achiam et al., 2023; Team, 2023; Qu et al., 2024). Although the Transformer dates back to 2017, its adaptability and robustness have made it indispensable for variety of tasks. Central to its success is the self-attention mechanism, which is highly effective for sequence modeling, but has quadratic complexity (w.r.t. sequence length), leading to significant computational costs during training. However, the ability to handle long-context sequences is crucial for large model applications, not only for language tasks but also for multi-modal tasks, where sequences naturally tend to be long (Xue et al., 2024). FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023; Shah et al., 2024) have provided substantial advancements in scaling attention to handle longer sequences by optimizing the CUDA-level computations for better hardware utilization. However, the theoretical complexity of FlashAttention remains quadratic. Moreover, the need to maintain the KV cache presents further difficulties in managing memory as the sequence length extends (Qin et al., 2024c). As result, long-sequence processing in Transformer models continues to be complex and resource-intensive problem. Recently, numerous variations of attention have been proposed, primarily aimed at addressing its quadratic computational and memory complexity, as well as the growing size of the KV cache (Peng et al., 2023; 2024). One promising approach line is linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), which replaces the exponential kernel in softmax attention with simpler dot product between key and query vectors. This shift allows linear attention to be structured as linear recurrent neural network (RNN) with matrixvalued hidden states, thereby eliminating the need for KV cache. In consequence, it supports constant-memory inference and reduces training complexity from quadratic to linear (Yang et al., 2023). parallel line of research focuses on State Space Models (SSMs), such as Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) and Mamba 2 (Dao & Gu, 2024), which draw upon concepts from control theory. Both linear attention and SSMs share common recurrent formulation, expressed as Ms = Ms1 + (cid:99)Ms, where (cid:99)Ms represents the increLASP-2 mental memory state of the s-th token (Yang et al., 2024). However, despite these advantages, they tend to perform poorly on recall-intensive tasks, such as in-context learning (e.g., five-shot MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), Phone-book lookup (Jelassi et al., 2024), Needle In Haystack (Briakou et al., 2023)) and long-context reasoning. Empirical research (Lieber et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2024; Waleffe et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025) has shown that models relying solely on linear sequence modeling struggle to excel in these domains. However, hybrid architecture combining linear sequence modeling layers with standard transformer layers has been demonstrated to significantly enhance model performance on tasks that are recall-intensive. Sequence Parallelism (SP) techniques (Korthikanti et al., 2022; Jacobs et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023) are commonly employed to partition long sequences into smaller subsequences, allowing them to be processed across multiple GPUs in parallel. Despite the advantages offered by SP for handling large sequences, current SP methods do not fully exploit the right-product-first feature of linear attention, which can lead to inefficiencies in parallelism and communication. LASP (Sun et al., 2024a) (referred to as LASP-1) introduced SP approach specifically tailored for linear attention, that uses point-to-point (P2P) communication strategy. In this method, intermediate states are transferred across GPUs in ring-style pattern within the distributed world. However, although such P2P ring-style communication offers certain benefits, part of its computation has to be executed sequentially, which leads low computation parallelism.

Representations are learned as result of optimizing for token-level perplexity. We propose Continuous Concept Mixing (CoCoMix), novel pretraining framework that combines discrete next token prediction with continuous concepts. Specifically, CoCoMix predicts continuous concepts learned from pretrained sparse autoencoder and mixes them into the models hidden state by interleaving with token hidden representations. Through experiments on multiple benchmarks, including language modeling and downstream reasoning tasks, we show that CoCoMix is more sample efficient and consistently outperforms standard next token prediction, knowledge distillation and inserting pause tokens. We find that combining both concept learning and interleaving in an end-to-end framework is critical to performance gains. Furthermore, CoCoMix enhances interpretability and steerability by allowing direct inspection and modification of the predicted concept, offering transparent way to guide the models internal reasoning process.

[ 1 6 0 6 8 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aWe provide distillation scaling law that estimates distilled model performance based on compute budget and its allocation between the student and teacher. Our findings reduce the risks associated with using distillation at scale; compute allocation for both the teacher and student models can now be done to maximize student performance. We provide compute optimal distillation recipes for when 1) teacher exists, or 2) teacher needs training. If many students are to be distilled, or teacher already exists, distillation outperforms supervised pretraining until compute level which grows predictably with student size. If one student is to be distilled and teacher also needs training, supervised learning should be done instead. Additionally, we provide insights across our large scale study of distillation, which increase our understanding of distillation and inform experimental design. 1. Introduction The study of scaling laws (Hestness et al., 2017; Rosenfeld et al., 2020; Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022) revealed that previously trained Language Models (LMs) could have been more capable if they had followed compute optimal training paradigm, which determines the model size and the number of training tokens that give the best performing model under given compute budget. Many subsequent works have followed compute optimal training (Dey et al., 2023; Muennighoff et al., 2023b). The size of compute optimal models grows with compute (Hoffmann et al., 2022), which makes them challenging to use due to the growth in inference costs. In practice, this means compute optimal models are slow, expensive to serve, consume more battery life, provide high barriers 1Apple 2University of Oxford, UK. Work done during an internship at Apple. For full breakdown of contributions see Appendix J. Correspondence to: Dan Busbridge <dbusbridge@apple.com>. Preprint. 1 Figure 1. Extrapolations of the Distillation Scaling Law. The distillation scaling law (Equation 8) is fitted on weak students (LS > 2.3) for range of teachers with losses LT . Solid lines represent predicted model behavior for unseen teachers for given student configuration (interpolation), and dashed lines represent predicted model behavior outside of seen teachers and for the strong student region (LS 2.3). As shown, the student can outperform the teacher (see Figures 2, 3 and 41 for details). to entry for academic study, and have significant carbon footprint. With inference volume up to billions of tokens per day (OpenAI & Pilipiszyn, 2021), the inference cost of an LM is typically significantly larger than its pretraining cost (Chien et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024a) and is going to further increase in an era of test-time compute scaling (Snell et al., 2024; Brown et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024b). Unsustainable inference costs have led to an alternative training paradigm, overtraining (Gadre et al., 2024), where the amount of training data used is much greater than in the compute optimal case, enabling small, capable models. Overtrained models better satisfy compute optimality when compute is measured over models lifetime, rather than just the pretraining cost (Sardana et al., 2024). As supervised scaling laws follow power laws in model size and training data, diminishing returns in performance ocDistillation Scaling Laws cur much sooner than in the compute-optimal case. To achieve reasonable capabilities, these models need to be trained on many trillions of tokens, (Snell et al., 2024; Brown et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024b), which is expensive and time-consuming. We seek models that match the performance of small overtrained models but at lower training cost. popular candidate is distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), where capable teacher LM produces targets for smaller student LM. When distillation is used for LM pretraining, we will call this distillation pretraining. There are many explanations for why distillation works, from dark knowledge transfer, where information is contained in the ratio of probabilities of incorrect classes (Hinton et al., 2015), to being form of regularization (Mobahi et al., 2020), or reducing noise in the learning process (Menon et al., 2020), among many other explanations. Despite lack of consensus for why distillation works, distillation pretraining has produced more capable models than supervised pretraining in the Gemma and Gemini (Rivière et al., 2024), Minitron (Muralidharan et al., 2024; Sreenivas et al., 2024) and AFM (Gunter et al., 2024) families of LMs in terms of both pretraining loss and downstream evaluations. Yet, at the same time, Liu et al. (2024) reported that distillation produces less capable models than supervised pretraining does. With such significant compute resources being devoted to distillation pretraining of LMs, it is essential to understand how to correctly allocate these resources, to produce the most capable models possible, and to have an understanding if any gains are even possible compared to supervised pretraining when both methods have access to the same resources (Dehghani et al., 2021). To close this knowledge gap, we perform an extensive controlled study of distillation, with students and teachers ranging from 143M to 12.6B parameters, trained on data of few billion tokens, up to 512B tokens. These experiments result in our distillation scaling law, which estimates student performance as function of resources (the teacher, the student size, and the amount of data used for distillation), resolving questions about when distillation is and is not effective in terms of producing models of desired capability under resource constraints of interest. We find: 1. The cross entropy of student of size NS distilled on DS tokens from teacher of size NT trained on DT tokens can be predicted using our distillation scaling law (Equation 8). 2. The teacher size NT and number of teacher training tokens DT determines the student cross-entropy only through their determination of the teachers crossentropy LT = LT (NT , DT ) (Figure 3b). 3. The influence of the teacher cross-entropy upon the student loss follows power law which transitions between two behaviors depending on the relative learning capacities of student and the teacher, reflecting phenomenon in distillation called the capacity gap, where stronger teacher produces worse student.

Recent advancements in image relighting models, driven by large-scale datasets and pre-trained diffusion models, have enabled the imposition of consistent lighting. However, video relighting still lags, primarily due to the excessive training costs and the scarcity of diverse, high-quality video relighting datasets. A simple application of image relighting models on a frame-by-frame basis leads to several issues: lighting source inconsistency and relighted appearance inconsistency, resulting in flickers in the generated videos. In this work, we propose Light-A-Video, a training-free approach to achieve temporally smooth video relighting. Adapted from image relighting models, Light-A-Video introduces two key techniques to enhance lighting consistency. First, we design a Consistent Light Attention (CLA) module, which enhances cross-frame interactions within the self-attention layers to stabilize the generation of the background lighting source. Second, leveraging the physical principle of light transport independence, we apply linear blending between the source video's appearance and the relighted appearance, using a Progressive Light Fusion (PLF) strategy to ensure smooth temporal transitions in illumination. Experiments show that Light-A-Video improves the temporal consistency of relighted video while maintaining the image quality, ensuring coherent lighting transitions across frames.

Text-conditioned image generation has gained significant attention in recent years and are processing increasingly longer and comprehensive text prompt. In everyday life, dense and intricate text appears in contexts like advertisements, infographics, and signage, where the integration of both text and visuals is essential for conveying complex information. However, despite these advances, the generation of images containing long-form text remains a persistent challenge, largely due to the limitations of existing datasets, which often focus on shorter and simpler text. To address this gap, we introduce TextAtlas5M, a novel dataset specifically designed to evaluate long-text rendering in text-conditioned image generation. Our dataset consists of 5 million long-text generated and collected images across diverse data types, enabling comprehensive evaluation of large-scale generative models on long-text image generation. We further curate 3000 human-improved test set TextAtlasEval across 3 data domains, establishing one of the most extensive benchmarks for text-conditioned generation. Evaluations suggest that the TextAtlasEval benchmarks present significant challenges even for the most advanced proprietary models (e.g. GPT4o with DallE-3), while their open-source counterparts show an even larger performance gap. These evidences position TextAtlas5M as a valuable dataset for training and evaluating future-generation text-conditioned image generation models.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced technique designed to address the challenges of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC). By integrating context retrieval into content generation, RAG provides reliable and up-to-date external knowledge, reduces hallucinations, and ensures relevant context across a wide range of tasks. However, despite RAG's success and potential, recent studies have shown that the RAG paradigm also introduces new risks, including robustness issues, privacy concerns, adversarial attacks, and accountability issues. Addressing these risks is critical for future applications of RAG systems, as they directly impact their trustworthiness. Although various methods have been developed to improve the trustworthiness of RAG methods, there is a lack of a unified perspective and framework for research in this topic. Thus, in this paper, we aim to address this gap by providing a comprehensive roadmap for developing trustworthy RAG systems. We place our discussion around five key perspectives: reliability, privacy, safety, fairness, explainability, and accountability. For each perspective, we present a general framework and taxonomy, offering a structured approach to understanding the current challenges, evaluating existing solutions, and identifying promising future research directions. To encourage broader adoption and innovation, we also highlight the downstream applications where trustworthy RAG systems have a significant impact.

Recent large language models (LLMs) support long contexts ranging from 128K to 1M tokens. A popular method for evaluating these capabilities is the needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test, which involves retrieving a "needle" (relevant information) from a "haystack" (long irrelevant context). Extensions of this approach include increasing distractors, fact chaining, and in-context reasoning. However, in these benchmarks, models can exploit existing literal matches between the needle and haystack to simplify the task. To address this, we introduce NoLiMa, a benchmark extending NIAH with a carefully designed needle set, where questions and needles have minimal lexical overlap, requiring models to infer latent associations to locate the needle within the haystack. We evaluate 12 popular LLMs that claim to support contexts of at least 128K tokens. While they perform well in short contexts (<1K), performance degrades significantly as context length increases. At 32K, for instance, 10 models drop below 50% of their strong short-length baselines. Even GPT-4o, one of the top-performing exceptions, experiences a reduction from an almost-perfect baseline of 99.3% to 69.7%. Our analysis suggests these declines stem from the increased difficulty the attention mechanism faces in longer contexts when literal matches are absent, making it harder to retrieve relevant information.

To address this, we introduce NoLiMa, a benchmark extending NIAH with a carefully designed needle set, where questions and needles have minimal lexical overlap, requiring models to infer latent associations to locate the needle within the haystack. We evaluate 12 popular LLMs that claim to support contexts of at least 128K tokens. While they perform well in short contexts (<1K), performance degrades significantly as context length increases. At 32K, for instance, 10 models drop below 50% of their strong short-length baselines. Even GPT-4o, one of the top-performing exceptions, experiences a reduction from an almost-perfect baseline of 99.3% to 69.7%. Our analysis suggests these declines stem from the increased difficulty the attention mechanism faces in longer contexts when literal matches are absent, making it harder to retrieve relevant information."

Linear sequence modeling approaches, such as linear attention, provide advantages like linear-time training and constant-memory inference over sequence lengths. However, existing sequence parallelism (SP) methods are either not optimized for the right-product-first feature of linear attention or use a ring-style communication strategy, which results in lower computation parallelism, limits their scalability for longer sequences in distributed systems. In this paper, we introduce LASP-2, a new SP method to enhance both communication and computation parallelism when training linear attention transformer models with very-long input sequences. Compared to previous work LASP, LASP-2 rethinks the minimal communication requirement for SP on linear attention layers, reorganizes the whole communication-computation workflow of LASP. In this way, only one single AllGather collective communication is needed on intermediate memory states, whose sizes are independent of the sequence length, leading to significant improvements of both communication and computation parallelism, as well as their overlap. Additionally, we extend LASP-2 to LASP-2H by applying similar communication redesign to standard attention modules, offering an efficient SP solution for hybrid models that blend linear and standard attention layers. Our evaluation on a Linear-Llama3 model, a variant of Llama3 with linear attention replacing standard attention, demonstrates the effectiveness of LASP-2 and LASP-2H. Specifically, LASP-2 achieves training speed improvements of 15.2% over LASP and 36.6% over Ring Attention, with a sequence length of 2048K across 64 GPUs.

Next token prediction has been the standard training objective used in large language model pretraining. Representations are learned as a result of optimizing for token-level perplexity. We propose Continuous Concept Mixing (CoCoMix), a novel pretraining framework that combines discrete next token prediction with continuous concepts. Specifically, CoCoMix predicts continuous concepts learned from a pretrained sparse autoencoder and mixes them into the model's hidden state by interleaving with token hidden representations. Through experiments on multiple benchmarks, including language modeling and downstream reasoning tasks, we show that CoCoMix is more sample efficient and consistently outperforms standard next token prediction, knowledge distillation and inserting pause tokens. We find that combining both concept learning and interleaving in an end-to-end framework is critical to performance gains. Furthermore, CoCoMix enhances interpretability and steerability by allowing direct inspection and modification of the predicted concept, offering a transparent way to guide the model's internal reasoning process.

We provide a distillation scaling law that estimates distilled model performance based on a compute budget and its allocation between the student and teacher. Our findings reduce the risks associated with using distillation at scale; compute allocation for both the teacher and student models can now be done to maximize student performance. We provide compute optimal distillation recipes for when 1) a teacher exists, or 2) a teacher needs training. If many students are to be distilled, or a teacher already exists, distillation outperforms supervised pretraining until a compute level which grows predictably with student size. If one student is to be distilled and a teacher also needs training, supervised learning should be done instead. Additionally, we provide insights across our large scale study of distillation, which increase our understanding of distillation and inform experimental design.

"We provide a distillation scaling law that estimates distilled model performance based on a compute budget and its allocation between the student and teacher. Our findings reduce the risks associated with using distillation at scale; compute allocation for both the teacher and student models can now be done to maximize student performance. We provide compute optimal distillation recipes for when 1) a teacher exists, or 2) a teacher needs training. If many students are to be distilled, or a teacher already exists, distillation outperforms supervised pretraining until a compute level which grows predictably with student size. If one student is to be distilled and a teacher also needs training, supervised learning should be done instead. Additionally, we provide insights across our large scale study of distillation, which increase our understanding of distillation and inform experimental design."
