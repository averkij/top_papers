With the increasing demand for deep learning in medical image applications [11], the extremely high cost of medical image collection and dense annotation are becoming large bottleneck [12]. The DCRL discovers the corresponding pixel1-wise features [13][16] to drive the learning of consistent or distinct representation for them (Fig.1 A)) which will effectively capture the dense posterior distribution of the underlying explanatory factors for the input.

Manuscript received April 19, 2005; revised August 26, 2015. 1. pixel for 2D and voxel for 3D images, we call pixel uniformly Fig. 1: The DCRL with the large-scale FP&N problem. A) The DCRL pulls and pushes the positive and negative feature pairs for consistent or distinct representation. However, B) medical images properties cause unreliable correspondence discovery, resulting in the open problem of large-scale FP&N features pairs in DCRL and extremely limiting the representation learning ability. JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 2 utilize the correspondence from the manual transformation of the same images weakening the FP problem, the diversity of positive pairs is limited (only paired from the same images) and they are still limited by large-scale FN problem. 2) Large-scale false negative (FN) pairs caused by semantic continuity and semantic overlap: a. Different from the imagewise contrastive learning [21][24] whose unit is instance, the DCRL utilizes the pixel as the unit which continuously arranges on images and constructs semantics via numerous pixels due to the continuity of image signal [21] (Fig.1 B) b)). This makes the semantics continuously distributed on images, so it is unreliable to absolutely divide the pixelwise features as different semantics on images as negative pairs. b. Some natural DCRL methods [1], [3], [4] utilize the features from different images as negative pairs, like momentum contrast mechanism [1], [3], [25] which utilizes memory bank to save previous features as negative samples (Fig.1 B) c)). However, due to the consistency of human body, medical images have similar global content which shares numerous same anatomies. This makes numerous overlapped semantics between images, so that it will construct numerous negative pairs with the same semantics resulting in FN pairs. During correspondence discovery, these properties will enlarge the risk of the FP&N feature pairs [18], [19] resulting in large-scale FP&N problem. It will train the networks representation to deviate from reality, making the pre-trained network even worse than the randomly initialized network. Therefore, we seek to answer the following question: How to cope with the FP&N problem for reliable pixel-wise correspondence in the medical image DCRL? Motivation: Inspired by topologie [26]  (Fig.2)  , homeomorphism [27] between medical images [28][30], e.g., CT, MR, X-ray, provides prior knowledge for reliable pixelwise correspondence. An often-repeated mathematical joke is that topologists cannot tell the difference between coffee cup and donut [31] (Fig.2 A)), because the coffee and donut are homeomorphic (have the same topology) and they are able to transform to each other via topologypreserved ma"

Dense contrastive representation learning (DCRL) has greatly improved the learning efficiency for image-dense prediction tasks, showing its great potential to reduce the large costs of medical image collection and dense annotation. However, the properties of medical images make unreliable correspondence discovery, bringing an open problem of large-scale false positive and negative (FP&N) pairs in DCRL. In this paper, we propose GEoMetric vIsual deNse sImilarity (GEMINI) learning which embeds the homeomorphism prior to DCRL and enables a reliable correspondence discovery for effective dense contrast. We propose a deformable homeomorphism learning (DHL) which models the homeomorphism of medical images and learns to estimate a deformable mapping to predict the pixels' correspondence under topological preservation. It effectively reduces the searching space of pairing and drives an implicit and soft learning of negative pairs via a gradient. We also propose a geometric semantic similarity (GSS) which extracts semantic information in features to measure the alignment degree for the correspondence learning. It will promote the learning efficiency and performance of deformation, constructing positive pairs reliably. We implement two practical variants on two typical representation learning tasks in our experiments. Our promising results on seven datasets which outperform the existing methods show our great superiority. We will release our code on a companion link: https://github.com/YutingHe-list/GEMINI.
