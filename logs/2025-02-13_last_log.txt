Text:"BenchMAX: Comprehensive Multilingual Evaluation Suite for Large Language Models Xu Huang 1 Wenhao Zhu 1 Hanxu Hu 4 Conghui He 2 Lei Li 3 Shujian Huang 1 Fei Yuan 2 5 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 6 4 3 7 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aPrevious multilingual benchmarks focus primarily on simple understanding tasks, but for large language models (LLMs), we emphasize proficiency in instruction following, reasoning, long context understanding, code generation, and so on. However, measuring these advanced capabilities across languages is underexplored. To address the disparity, we introduce BenchMAX, multi-way multilingual evaluation benchmark that allows for fair comparisons of these important abilities across languages. To maintain high quality, three distinct native-speaking annotators independently annotate each sample within all tasks after the data was machine-translated from English into 16 other languages. Additionally, we present novel translation challenge stemming from dataset construction. Extensive experiments on BenchMAX reveal varying effectiveness of core capabilities across languages, highlighting performance gaps that cannot be bridged by simply scaling up model size. BenchMAX serves as comprehensive multilingual evaluation platform, providing promising test bed to promote the development of multilingual language models. The dataset1 and code2 are publicly accessible. 1. Introduction Large language models (OpenAI et al., 2024; Gemini, 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024) have displayed remarkable proficiency across wide range of tasks, mainly because they excel in instruction following, reasoning, long context under1National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University 2Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory 3Carnegie Mellon University 4University of Zurich.

BenchMAX evaluates diverse advanced capabilities of LLMs in multilingual context. standing, code generation, and so on (Ouyang et al., 2022; Cobbe et al., 2021; Su et al., 2024; Roziere et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024). Inherently, these capabilities are language-agnostic. Consider simple task like the acquisition of mathematical concept: the numerical outcome remains consistent regardless of whether one learns the arithmetic expression 1 + 1 = 2 in English or Chinese. Similarly, when it comes to coding tasks, the choice between English or Chinese for articulating these instructions does not alter the fundamental logic of the code. However, numerous empirical studies have shown that LLMs multilingual performance is quite unbalanced across different languages when handling same tasks (Shi et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2024; Qi et al., 2023). However, current benchmarks (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Lai et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a) do not support comprehensive testing of the language-agnostic abilities of LLMs, particularly in low-resource language settings, for several reasons. Tasks like XWinograd (Muennighoff et al., 2023) and XStoryCloze (Lin et al., 2022), based on multiple-choice formats, do not fully evaluate the generative capacities of LLMs. Additionally, the limited language overlap across existing benchmarks poses chalBenchMAX: Comprehensive Multilingual Evaluation Suite for Large Language Models Table 1. BenchMAX provides more comprehensive analysis of LLM language-agnostic capabilities by covering broader range of capability scenarios, language families, and script systems. # LG and # LG-Family denote the number of supported languages and the language families they belong to, respectively. RnonLatin refers to the proportion of languages that do not use the Latin script among supported languages. The results are from P-MMEval.

Recently, P-MMEval (Zhang et al., 2024) is proposed as multilingual multitask benchmark, with the majority of its tasks still following multiple-choice format. While it includes assessments like MGSM (Shi et al., 2023) and MIFEVAL that cover partial language-agnostic capabilities, LLMs exhibit remarkable performance, as shown in Table 1. This narrow focus leaves significant gap between research evaluation and real-world applications. To tackle this problem, we develop comprehensive, multiway, and challenging multilingual evaluation suite, called BenchMAX, to help the community better analyze and improve the language-agnostic capabilities of LLMs. Covering 17 languages3, BenchMAX not only includes broader range of language families but also emphasizes the diversity of writing systems across languages  (Table 1)  . As demonstrated in Table 1, BenchMAX increases the percentage of studied languages that utilize the non-Latin script. Meanwhile, BenchMAX highlights diverse languageagnostic advanced capabilities (Figure 1). We assess instruction following capability with rule-based (Zhou et al., 2023) and model-based (Li et al., 2024) evaluations, code generation capability in diverse scenarios (functioncompletion (Liu et al., 2024) / problem solving (Jain et al., 2024)), long context understanding capability (Hsieh et al., 2024), verity of reasoning in math (Shi et al., 2023) and science (Rein et al., 2023), tool use (Srinivasan et al., 2023) in agent environments, and general (Costa-juss`a et al., 2022) / domain translation. Domain translation, byproduct of data construction, poses new challenge for LLM by necessitating fine-grained control and domain-specific terminology understanding over the translation process. 3The 17 languages include English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Bengali, Japanese, Thai, Swahili, Chinese, Telugu, Arabic, Korean, Serbian, Czech, Hungarian, and Vietnamese. To ensure high quality, we devise an annotation framework to optimize the dataset quality with human effort and LLM feedback. The process involves translating data from English to selected non-English languages using machine translation systems, post-editing each sample by three nativespeaking "

[ 2 1 1 4 4 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aModel merging aggregates Large Language Models (LLMs) finetuned on different tasks into stronger one. However, parameter conflicts between models leads to performance degradation in averaging. While model routing addresses this issue by selecting individual models during inference, it imposes excessive storage and compute costs, and fails to leverage the common knowledge from different models. In this work, we observe that different layers exhibit varying levels of parameter conflicts. Building on this insight, we average layers with minimal parameter conflicts and use novel task-level expert routing for layers with significant conflicts. To further reduce storage costs, inspired by task arithmetic sparsity, we decouple multiple fine-tuned experts into dense expert and several sparse experts. Considering the out-of-distribution samples, we select and merge appropriate experts based on the task uncertainty of the input data. We conduct extensive experiments on both LLaMA and Qwen with varying parameter scales, and evaluate on real-world reasoning tasks. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves significant performance improvements while requiring less system cost compared to existing methods. 1. Introduction Finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) enables them to adapt to downstream applications including sentiment analysis (Sun et al., 2023), text summarization (Fang et al., 2024), mathematical reasoning (Ruis et al., 2024), code writing (Jiang et al., 2024b), roleplay chatting (Chen et al., 2025) *Equal contribution 1The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) 2The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 3Platform and Content Group, Tencent 4Sun Yatsen University.

Open-source platforms such as Huggingface (Wolf et al., 2019) and torchvision (Marcel & Rodriguez, 2010) facilitate access to diverse array of highly trained expert models with varying capabilities. Considering the computational resources are scarce and implementing green computing (Samsi et al., 2023; You et al., 2022; Stojkovic et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2024), the community is increasingly interested in how to merge these models to create superior LLM that retains the strengths of finetuned ones without retraining (Yang et al., 2024b; Lu et al., 2024b; Du et al., 2024; Yadav et al., 2023b). Figure 1: Knowledge conflict across finetuned LLMs and math and code dataset. Deeper color means larger parameter conflicts. And it is difficult for the linear averaged model to achieve low loss of both tasks. One predominant merging strategy is model averaging (Yang et al., 2024b; Matena & Raffel, 2022; Thennal et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024b), which computes weighted averages of parameters to synthesize collective knowledge (Matena & Raffel, 2022; Yadav et al., 2023b). However, model averaging faces challenges from parameter conflicts arising from diverse finetuning tasks, leading to performance degradation as shown in Figure 1. Another direction is model routing (Lu et al., 2024b; Muqeeth et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024c; Du et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024a; He et al., 2024a; Wei et al., 2024a; Chen et al., 2024), which aggregates models and performs model selection during inference. This method avoids parameter conflicts but incurs significant computing and storage (system) costs due to maintaining all finetuned models. This motivates us to rethink the following questions: How to better merge common and unique knowledge from various finetuned models while simultaneously avoiding parameter conflicts and minimizing system costs? 1 Mediator: Memory-efficient LLM Merging with Less Parameter Conflicts and Uncertainty Based Routing To answer this question, we firstly quantify the conflicts between finetuned LLMs. We employ sign consistency between different task arithmetics that are difference between the finetuned LLM and the original LLM to measure the conflicts. We find that the front and last layers tend to exhibit the highest levels of conflict, suggesting that these layers are particularly sensitive to averaging. In contrast, the central layers demonstrate comparatively lower levels of conflict, indicating that they retain more common knowledge. Then, we introduce Mediator as an adaptive model merging framework to enhance LLM merging with little storage and computation costs. Inspired by the varying degrees of layer-wise parameter conflicts, we propose adaptive merging that averages layers with lower conflict levels, thereby capturing the common knowledge (Yadav et al., 2023b; He et al., 2024b) shared among LLMs while minimizing conflicts (Yadav et al., 2023b). Concurrently, layers with significant conflicts are regarded as experts to be routed during inference, preserving unique task-specific knowledge without dilution (Yadav et al., 2023b; He et al., 2024b). While direct compression of finetuned LLMs results in significant information loss (Dong et al.; Sun et al., 2024), we leverage both layer-wise model merging and the high sparsity of task arithmetics (Yadav et al., 2023b) to decompose models into base and task-specific components (Ilharco et al., 2023; He et al., 2024b; Yang et al., 2024c; Tang et al., 2024b). By integrating these two techniques, our approach reduces storage from 50% to 7% with minimal accuracy loss while preserving layer-specific knowledge. Observing that LLMs are finetuned on the complete sentences of their downstream tasks instead of the splited sub-sequences, to better preserve task-specific knowledge and improve overall model performance, we propose tasklevel expert routing instead of token-level routing (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Sukhbaatar et al., 2024a; Zhou et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2024a). With these designs, our merged LLM achieves high efficiency with minimal performance degradation (0.06% 0.3%). Our evaluations show that we can effectively run model comparable to 7B 4 LLM ensemble on single RTX 4090 GPU, making highperformance LLM more accessible in resource-constrained environments(Appendix G.3). Considering the out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, we select and merge appropriate experts based on the task uncertainty of the input d"

The ability to achieve long-term goals is a key challenge in the current development of large language models (LLMs). To address this, pre-trained LLMs can be fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL) to explore solutions that optimize a given goal. However, exploration with LLMs is difficult, as a balance has to be struck between discovering new solutions and staying close enough to the pre-trained model, so as not to degrade basic capabilities. This is typically controlled with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) penalty. In this paper, we investigate the exploration dynamics of a small language model on a simple arithmetic task. We show how varying degrees of pre-training influence exploration and demonstrate the importance of "critical tokens" which have a dramatic impact on the final outcome. Consequently, we introduce a simple modification to the KL penalty that favors exploration on critical tokens, increasing the efficiency of the RL fine-tuning stage.

Previous multilingual benchmarks focus primarily on simple understanding tasks, but for large language models(LLMs), we emphasize proficiency in instruction following, reasoning, long context understanding, code generation, and so on. However, measuring these advanced capabilities across languages is underexplored. To address the disparity, we introduce BenchMAX, a multi-way multilingual evaluation benchmark that allows for fair comparisons of these important abilities across languages. To maintain high quality, three distinct native-speaking annotators independently annotate each sample within all tasks after the data was machine-translated from English into 16 other languages. Additionally, we present a novel translation challenge stemming from dataset construction. Extensive experiments on BenchMAX reveal varying effectiveness of core capabilities across languages, highlighting performance gaps that cannot be bridged by simply scaling up model size. BenchMAX serves as a comprehensive multilingual evaluation platform, providing a promising test bed to promote the development of multilingual language models. The dataset and code are publicly accessible.

Recent character image animation methods based on diffusion models, such as Animate Anyone, have made significant progress in generating consistent and generalizable character animations. However, these approaches fail to produce reasonable associations between characters and their environments. To address this limitation, we introduce Animate Anyone 2, aiming to animate characters with environment affordance. Beyond extracting motion signals from source video, we additionally capture environmental representations as conditional inputs. The environment is formulated as the region with the exclusion of characters and our model generates characters to populate these regions while maintaining coherence with the environmental context. We propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy that more effectively characterizes the relationship between character and environment. Furthermore, to enhance the fidelity of object interactions, we leverage an object guider to extract features of interacting objects and employ spatial blending for feature injection. We also introduce a pose modulation strategy that enables the model to handle more diverse motion patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

Model merging aggregates Large Language Models (LLMs) finetuned on different tasks into a stronger one. However, parameter conflicts between models leads to performance degradation in averaging. While model routing addresses this issue by selecting individual models during inference, it imposes excessive storage and compute costs, and fails to leverage the common knowledge from different models. In this work, we observe that different layers exhibit varying levels of parameter conflicts. Building on this insight, we average layers with minimal parameter conflicts and use a novel task-level expert routing for layers with significant conflicts. To further reduce storage costs, inspired by task arithmetic sparsity, we decouple multiple fine-tuned experts into a dense expert and several sparse experts. Considering the out-of-distribution samples, we select and merge appropriate experts based on the task uncertainty of the input data. We conduct extensive experiments on both LLaMA and Qwen with varying parameter scales, and evaluate on real-world reasoning tasks. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves significant performance improvements while requiring less system cost compared to existing methods.

Recent advancements in image relighting models, driven by large-scale datasets and pre-trained diffusion models, have enabled the imposition of consistent lighting. However, video relighting still lags, primarily due to the excessive training costs and the scarcity of diverse, high-quality video relighting datasets. A simple application of image relighting models on a frame-by-frame basis leads to several issues: lighting source inconsistency and relighted appearance inconsistency, resulting in flickers in the generated videos. In this work, we propose Light-A-Video, a training-free approach to achieve temporally smooth video relighting. Adapted from image relighting models, Light-A-Video introduces two key techniques to enhance lighting consistency. First, we design a Consistent Light Attention (CLA) module, which enhances cross-frame interactions within the self-attention layers to stabilize the generation of the background lighting source. Second, leveraging the physical principle of light transport independence, we apply linear blending between the source video's appearance and the relighted appearance, using a Progressive Light Fusion (PLF) strategy to ensure smooth temporal transitions in illumination. Experiments show that Light-A-Video improves the temporal consistency of relighted video while maintaining the image quality, ensuring coherent lighting transitions across frames.
