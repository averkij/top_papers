Text:"Next Block Prediction: Video Generation via Semi-Autoregressive Modeling Shuhuai Ren 1 Shuming Ma 2 Xu Sun 1 Furu Wei 2 https://renshuhuai-andy.github.io/NBP-project/ 5 2 0 2 2 1 ] . [ 2 7 3 7 7 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract Next-Token Prediction (NTP) is de facto approach for autoregressive (AR) video generation, but it suffers from suboptimal unidirectional dependencies and slow inference speed. In this work, we propose semi-autoregressive (semiAR) framework, called Next-Block Prediction (NBP), for video generation. By uniformly decomposing video content into equal-sized blocks (e.g., rows or frames), we shift the generation unit from individual tokens to blocks, allowing each token in the current block to simultaneously predict the corresponding token in the next block. Unlike traditional AR modeling, our framework employs bidirectional attention within each block, enabling tokens to capture more robust spatial dependencies. By predicting multiple tokens in parallel, NBP models significantly reduce the number of generation steps, leading to faster and more efficient inference. Our model achieves FVD scores of 103.3 on UCF101 and 25.5 on K600, outperforming the vanilla NTP model by an average of 4.4. Furthermore, thanks to the reduced number of inference steps, the NBP model generates 8.89 frames (128128 resolution) per second, achieving an 11 speedup. We also explored model scales ranging from 700M to 3B parameters, observing significant improvements in generation quality, with FVD scores dropping from 103.3 to 55.3 on UCF101 and from 25.5 to 19.5 on K600, demonstrating the scalability of our approach. 1.

[ 1 9 9 5 7 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r DPO-Shift: Shifting the Distribution of Direct Preference Optimization Xiliang Yang * 1 2 Feng Jiang 1 Qianen Zhang 1 Lei Zhao 3 Xiao LiDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants have become increasingly popular for aligning language models with human preferences. These methods aim to teach models to better distinguish between chosen (or preferred) and rejected (or dispreferred) responses. However, prior research has identified that the probability of chosen responses often decreases during training, and this phenomenon is known as likelihood displacement. To tackle this challenge, in this work we introduce DPO-Shift to controllably shift the distribution of the chosen probability. Then, we show that DPO-Shift exhibits fundamental tradeoff between improving the chosen probability and sacrificing the reward margin, as supported by both theoretical analysis and experimental validation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of DPO-Shift over DPO on downstream tasks such as MT-Bench and designed win rate experiment. We believe this study shows that the likelihood displacement issue of DPO can be effectively mitigated with simple, theoretically grounded solution. Our code is available at https:// github.com/Meaquadddd/DPO-Shift. 1. Introduction There has been growing interest in guiding large language models (LLMs) to generate safe and helpful content to align with human values and intentions, or, taken together, preferences. One of the most important methods in this field is known as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022; Stiennon et al., 2020). However, multi-stage optimization procedure is raised in these methods, which includes the *Most of the work of Xiliang Yang was done when he was with School of Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. 1School of Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen 2School of Mathematics, South China University of Technology 3Institute of Translational Medicine and National Center for Translational Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Correspondence to: Xiao Li <lixiao@cuhk.edu.cn>. 1 training of reward model and the policy model to maximize the reward. Such optimization and computational burden make it challenging to use and analyze, despite its ability to improve the quality of generated responses (Bai et al., 2022; Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023). Related Works. Recently, DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) and its variants (Meng et al., 2024; Azar et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024; Ethayarajh et al., 2024; Park et al., 2024) is attracting more and more attention. Given pair of samples (x, yw, yl) from the dataset, where is the prompt, and yw and yl represent the chosen and rejected responses, respectivelyannotated by strong large language models or humansthe loss of DPO is designed to maximize the margin between the reward of the chosen response and the rejected response for the model πθ. Being offline algorithms, its simplicity makes DPO more applicable and stable. The main difference between DPO and RLHF lies in the treatment of reward function. DPO proposes to directly parameterize it with the policy model, therefore eliminating the need of training an extra reward model and largely simplifying the training process. However, it has been reported that both log πθ(ywx) and log πθ(ylx) often decrease simultaneously during the training process of DPO; see, e.g., (Pal et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024; Rafailov et al., 2024; Tajwar et al., 2024; Pang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Razin et al., 2024). There are several names used to describe such phenomenon, and we adopt the term likelihood displacement (Razin et al., 2024) in this work. Though DPO still maximizes the reward margin even with this likelihood displacement issue, it remains unfavorable as it causes an unexpected increase in probabilities for responses that are neither preferred nor dispreferred. Prior work has attributed this phenomenon to limitations in model capacity (Tajwar et al., 2024), the presence of multiple training samples or output tokens (Pal et al., 2024), and the initial SFT phase (Rafailov et al., 2024). Existing studies, such as (Razin et al., 2024), have provided theoretical insights into addressing this gap and proposed solving the likelihood displacement problem by filtering the datasets. Main Contributions. In this paper, we propose DPO-Shift, aiming to solve the likelihood displacement issue of DPO, by adding parameter function (λ) to the rejected reward in the BradleyTerry (BT) model (Bradley & Terry, 1952), DPO-Shift: Shifting the Distribution of Direct Preference Optimization which is detailed in (3). We briefly illustrate in Figure 1 that, by choosing proper (λ) in DPO-Shift, we successfully achieve balance between the distribution of log πθ(ywx) and the reward margin. The first row in Figure 1 represents the SFTed model; since the reward margin is not applicable for it, the right plot is concentrated at 0. The second row corresponds to specific choice of (λ) of our proposed DPO-Shift, where we observe an increased chosen probability compared to DPO (depicted in the last row). This improvement is accompanied by only slight decrease in accuracy of reward margin (i.e., the frequency of r(x, yw) r(x, yl) > 0 on the test set). In fact, we can achieve nearly as high reward margin as that of DPO by choosing (λ) properly; see Section 4. Figure 1. Left: Distribution of log πθ(ywx) and log πθ(ylx). Right: Kernel density estimation (KDE) for the reward margin (r(x, yw) r(x, yl)). The reward accuracy, which is the sample mean of 1{(x, yw, yl)r(x, yw) r(x, yl) > 0} is listed. The three rows are plotted with three models including the SFTed Llama 3-8B, the model trained by one strategy of DPO-Shift, and the model trained by DPO (from top to bottom), separately. The ranges of the y-axis of all subfigures are the same. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows. We propose DPO-Shift to mitigate the likelihood displacement issue of DPO by controllably shifting the distribution of the chosen probability. This is achieved through new parameter function (λ) introduced in 2 DPO-Shift. Our approach is as simple as DPO and does not require modifications to the dataset. We provide theoretical analysis for the proposed DPO-Shift without imposing additional assumptions. The analysis guarantees that DPO"

"In the field of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing image interpretation, although Vision language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress in natural language processing and image understanding, their applications remain limited in professional domains due to insufficient domain expertise. This paper innovatively proposes the first large-scale multimodal dialogue dataset for SAR images, named SARChat-2M, which contains approximately 2 million high-quality image-text pairs, encompasses diverse scenarios with detailed target annotations. This dataset not only supports several key tasks such as visual understanding and object detection tasks, but also has unique innovative aspects: this study develop a visual-language dataset and benchmark for the SAR domain, enabling and evaluating VLMs' capabilities in SAR image interpretation, which provides a paradigmatic framework for constructing multimodal datasets across various remote sensing vertical domains. Through experiments on 16 mainstream VLMs, the effectiveness of the dataset has been fully verified, and the first multi-task dialogue benchmark in the SAR field has been successfully established. The project will be released at https://github.com/JimmyMa99/SARChat, aiming to promote the in-depth development and wide application of SAR visual language models."

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong general reasoning abilities, yet their effectiveness in financial reasoning remains underexplored. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate 16 powerful reasoning and general LLMs on three complex financial tasks involving financial text, tabular data, and equations, assessing numerical reasoning, tabular interpretation, financial terminology comprehension, long-context processing, and equation-based problem solving. Our results show that while better datasets and pretraining improve financial reasoning, general enhancements like CoT fine-tuning do not always yield consistent gains. Moreover, all reasoning strategies face challenges in improving performance on long-context and multi-table tasks. To address these limitations, we develop a financial reasoning-enhanced model based on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, by CoT fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with domain-specific reasoning paths. Even with simple fine-tuning with one financial dataset, our model achieves a consistent 10% performance improvement across tasks, surpassing all 8B models and even Llama3-70B-Instruct and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct on average. Our results highlight the need for domain-specific adaptations in financial tasks, emphasizing future directions such as multi-table reasoning, long-context processing, and financial terminology comprehension. All our datasets, models, and codes are publicly available. Furthermore, we introduce a leaderboard for benchmarking future datasets and models.

Modern large language models (LLMs) often encounter communication bottlenecks on current hardware, rather than purely computational constraints. Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the key-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be cached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to traditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA employs an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional computation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated efficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers still rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to adopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA while maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold. To encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce **TransMLA**, a post-training method that converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen, Mixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo additional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache size. Furthermore, we plan to develop MLA-specific inference acceleration techniques to preserve low latency in transformed models, thus enabling more efficient distillation of Deepseek R1.

In this work, we present CineMaster, a novel framework for 3D-aware and controllable text-to-video generation. Our goal is to empower users with comparable controllability as professional film directors: precise placement of objects within the scene, flexible manipulation of both objects and camera in 3D space, and intuitive layout control over the rendered frames. To achieve this, CineMaster operates in two stages. In the first stage, we design an interactive workflow that allows users to intuitively construct 3D-aware conditional signals by positioning object bounding boxes and defining camera movements within the 3D space. In the second stage, these control signals--comprising rendered depth maps, camera trajectories and object class labels--serve as the guidance for a text-to-video diffusion model, ensuring to generate the user-intended video content. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of in-the-wild datasets with 3D object motion and camera pose annotations, we carefully establish an automated data annotation pipeline that extracts 3D bounding boxes and camera trajectories from large-scale video data. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that CineMaster significantly outperforms existing methods and implements prominent 3D-aware text-to-video generation.

"In this work, we present CineMaster, a novel framework for 3D-aware and controllable text-to-video generation. Our goal is to empower users with comparable controllability as professional film directors: precise placement of objects within the scene, flexible manipulation of both objects and camera in 3D space, and intuitive layout control over the rendered frames. To achieve this, CineMaster operates in two stages. In the first stage, we design an interactive workflow that allows users to intuitively construct 3D-aware conditional signals by positioning object bounding boxes and defining camera movements within the 3D space. In the second stage, these control signals--comprising rendered depth maps, camera trajectories and object class labels--serve as the guidance for a text-to-video diffusion model, ensuring to generate the user-intended video content. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of in-the-wild datasets with 3D object motion and camera pose annotations, we carefully establish an automated data annotation pipeline that extracts 3D bounding boxes and camera trajectories from large-scale video data.

Next-Token Prediction (NTP) is a de facto approach for autoregressive (AR) video generation, but it suffers from suboptimal unidirectional dependencies and slow inference speed. In this work, we propose a semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) framework, called Next-Block Prediction (NBP), for video generation. By uniformly decomposing video content into equal-sized blocks (e.g., rows or frames), we shift the generation unit from individual tokens to blocks, allowing each token in the current block to simultaneously predict the corresponding token in the next block. Unlike traditional AR modeling, our framework employs bidirectional attention within each block, enabling tokens to capture more robust spatial dependencies. By predicting multiple tokens in parallel, NBP models significantly reduce the number of generation steps, leading to faster and more efficient inference. Our model achieves FVD scores of 103.3 on UCF101 and 25.5 on K600, outperforming the vanilla NTP model by an average of 4.4. Furthermore, thanks to the reduced number of inference steps, the NBP model generates 8.89 frames (128x128 resolution) per second, achieving an 11x speedup. We also explored model scales ranging from 700M to 3B parameters, observing significant improvements in generation quality, with FVD scores dropping from 103.3 to 55.3 on UCF101 and from 25.5 to 19.5 on K600, demonstrating the scalability of our approach.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants have become increasingly popular for aligning language models with human preferences. These methods aim to teach models to better distinguish between chosen (or preferred) and rejected (or dispreferred) responses. However, prior research has identified that the probability of chosen responses often decreases during training, and this phenomenon is known as likelihood displacement. To tackle this challenge, in this work we introduce \method to controllably shift the distribution of the chosen probability. Then, we show that \method exhibits a fundamental trade-off between improving the chosen probability and sacrificing the reward margin, as supported by both theoretical analysis and experimental validation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of \method over DPO on downstream tasks such as MT-Bench and a designed win rate experiment. We believe this study shows that the likelihood displacement issue of DPO can be effectively mitigated with a simple, theoretically grounded solution. Our code is available at https://github.com/Meaquadddd/DPO-Shift.
