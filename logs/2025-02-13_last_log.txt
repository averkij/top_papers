[ 1 7 4 0 8 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aCurrent Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have achieved outstanding performance in GUI element grounding. However, planning remains highly challenging, especially due to sensitivity to the initial state of the environment. Specifically, slight differences in the initial statesuch as the target software not being open or the interface not being in its default stateoften lead to planning errors. This issue is widespread in real application scenarios, but existing benchmarks fail to evaluate it. In this paper, we present WorldGUI, novel GUI benchmark that designs GUI tasks with various initial states to simulate real computeruser interactions. The benchmark spans wide range of tasks across 10 popular software applications, including PowerPoint, VSCode, and Adobe Acrobat. In addition, to address the challenges of dynamic GUI automation tasks, we propose GUI-Thinker, holistic framework, leveraging critique mechanism, that effectively manages the unpredictability and complexity of GUI interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that GUI-Thinker significantly outperforms Claude3.5 (Computer Use) by 14.9% in success rate on WorldGUI tasks. This improvement underscores the effectiveness of our critical-thinkingbased framework in enhancing GUI automation. 1. Introduction Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation has become prominent research area, driven by the need to enhance user productivity. This domain encompasses software usage, file management, office design, coding, and web browsing. Building upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2023) and Claude-3.5 (Anthropic, 2024), GUI agents have the potential to solve various computer tasks to avoid repetitive work or as an AI assistant to help the user. 1Show Lab, National University of Singapore. Correspondence to: Mike Zheng Shou <mike.shou@nus.edu>. Figure 1. The comparison of static and dynamic testing processes. Our WorldGUI takes the first step to facilitate comprehensive GUI evaluation with various initial states. The red node represents an incorrect state. GUI automation operates in dynamic environment, which goes beyond the traditional computer vision tasks like image recognition (He et al., 2016) and visual question answering (Antol et al., 2015). However, current GUI benchmarks such as OSWorld (Xie et al., 2024) and WebArena (Zhou et al.) do not capture this dynamism. As shown on the left side of Fig. 1, most GUI benchmarks focus on initial and final states, measuring success rates but overlooking the changing initial conditions present in real GUI scenarios. These benchmarks often ignore situations where: (1) The software interface is not in its default state. (2) The agent might get user queries at any time. (3) Differences in agent robustness, where agents with the same low success rate (e.g. 20%) may vary in their ability to self-verify or self-correct, but these abilities are not measured in static setting. As result, these benchmarks fail to fully assess the capabilities of GUI agents. In this paper, we take the first step toward comprehensive GUI agent testing by designing GUI tasks with various initial states. As illustrated on the right side of Fig. 1, the testing process of WorldGUI can be featured: (1) Intermediate Starting States: Real user interactions with GUI assistants do not always begin from default conditions, allowing tasks to start from intermediate states where users may seek assistance at any point (see Fig. 1 (b)). (2) Contextual Variability: In some cases, tasks may originate from entirely different contexts or interfaces, requiring the agent to adapt by modifying existing steps (see Fig. 1 (c)) or intro1 WorldGUI: Dynamic Testing for Comprehensive Desktop GUI Automation ducing new steps (see Fig. 1 (d)) to ensure task progression. By incorporating these elements, WorldGUI better mirrors real-world GUI environments, enabling more accurate and thorough assessment of GUI agent capabilities. Specifically, we present WorldGUI, new benchmark featuring 10 desktop software applications and 315 tasks, including PowerPoint, Word, Excel, VSCode, etc. For each task, we provide user query, an instructional video, and the corresponding project file. To ensure the task quality, we engaged four trained annotators skilled in using these applications and proficient in constructing data with scripts and agents for annotation. To stimulate the dynamic testing scenarios, we demonstrate each task to obtain ground-truth (GT) plans and then conduct the augmentations for each task using pre-actions. (See details in Sec. 3.) In addition, we introduce novel GUI agent framework, GUI-Thinker, which builds upon critical thinking philosophy, an aspect less emphasized in previous GUI agents (Hong et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2024; Lai et al., 2024; Agashe et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024). In dynamic GUI environments, application settings may not be in default configurations. This unpredictability requires agents to have the essential ability to detect and adapt to such changes to ensure task accuracy. Through our analysis of real-world GUI scenarios, we identify three critical designs for comprehensive agent: (1) Post-Planning Critique, (2) PreExecution Validation, and (3) Post-Action Evaluation. Specifically, GUI-Thinker comprises five core components: Planner, Planner-Critic, Step-Check, Actor, and Actor-Critic. We argue that these components are fundamental for effective GUI agents. To summarize, our key contributions are the following: (1) We are the first to stress the dynamic testing processes in GUI automation and propose new benchmark WorldGUI which designs the GUI tasks with various initial states to simulate the real interactions; (2) We introduce GUIThinker, comprehensive GUI framework. GUI-Thinker incorporate the thinking into the overall agent design, which provides valuable insights and guidance for future development; (3) We explore the essential property of critical thinking in GUI agents and empirically show that critical thinking is extremely useful for handling complex tasks. 2.

For web applications, WebShop (Yao et al., 2022), and WebArena (Zhou et al.) are two text-based GUI benchmarks, the GUI in"

"Current GUI agents have achieved outstanding performance in GUI element grounding. However, planning remains highly challenging, especially due to sensitivity to the initial state of the environment. Specifically, slight differences in the initial state-such as the target software not being open or the interface not being in its default state-often lead to planning errors. This issue is widespread in real user scenarios, but existing benchmarks fail to evaluate it. In this paper, we present WorldGUI, a novel GUI benchmark that designs GUI tasks with various initial states to simulate real computer-user interactions. The benchmark spans a wide range of tasks across 10 popular software applications, including PowerPoint, VSCode, and Adobe Acrobat. In addition, to address the challenges of dynamic GUI automation tasks, we propose GUI-Thinker, a holistic framework, leveraging a critique mechanism, that effectively manages the unpredictability and complexity of GUI interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that GUI-Thinker significantly outperforms Claude-3.5 (Computer Use) by 14.9% in success rate on WorldGUI tasks. This improvement underscores the effectiveness of our critical-thinking-based framework in enhancing GUI automation."

We propose a novel dynamic safety framework that optimizes language model (LM) safety reasoning at inference time without modifying model weights. Building on recent advances in self-critique methods, our approach leverages a meta-critique mechanism that iteratively updates safety prompts-termed specifications-to drive the critique and revision process adaptively. This test-time optimization not only improves performance against adversarial jailbreak requests but also in diverse general safety-related tasks, such as avoiding moral harm or pursuing honest responses. Our empirical evaluations across several language models demonstrate that dynamically optimized safety prompts yield significantly higher safety scores compared to fixed system prompts and static self-critique defenses.
