An iterative sampling algorithm enhances reasoning capabilities in base models without additional training, matching or outperforming reinforcement learning on single-shot tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models. In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining. Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

Метод основан на техниках Markov chain Monte Carlo и использует собственные вероятности базовой модели для генерации ответов. Алгоритм показывает результаты, сравнимые или превосходящие reinforcement learning на задачах типа MATH500, HumanEval и GPQA. Ключевое преимущество — не требуется обучение, датасеты или верификатор, при этом сохраняется разнообразие генерируемых ответов.",
