Index TermsText-to-Video Generation, Prompt Optimization, Test-Time Scaling.W ITH the rapid advancement of diffusion models [37], [68], [69], visual content creation has experienced remarkable progress in recent years. The generation of images, as well as videos from text prompts utilizing large-scale diffusion models, referred to as text-to-images (T2I) [39], [50], [70] and text-to-videos (T2V) [27], [72], [86] generation, have attracted significant interest due to the broad range of applications in real-world scenarios. Various efforts have been made to enhance the performance of these models, including improvements in model architecture [32], [32], [73], learning strategies [26], [74], and data curation [76], [77], [80]. Recent studies [22], [26], [61] have revealed that employing long, detailed prompts with pre-trained model typically produces superior quality outcomes compared to utilizing shallow descriptions provided by users. This has underscored the significance of prompt optimization as an important challenge in text-based visual content creation. The prompts provided by users are often brief and lack the essential details required to generate vivid images or videos. Simply attempting to optimize prompts by manually adding random descriptions can potentially mislead models and degrade the quality of generative results, resulting in outputs that may not align with user intentions.

Corresponding author. *Project lead. developing automated methods to enhance user-provided prompts becomes essential for improving the overall quality of generated content. Towards improving image aesthetics and ensuring semantic consistency, several attempts [25], [44], [45] have been made in previous T2I works for prompt optimization. These efforts primarily involve instructing pre-trained or fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to incorporate detailed modifiers into original prompts, with the aim of enhancing spatial elements such as color and relationships. While these approaches have displayed promising outcomes in image generation, studies [22], [55] reveal that their impact on video generation remains limited, especially in terms of enhancing temporal aspects such as motion smoothness and minimizing temporal flickering. For T2V generation, recent efforts [1], [2], [26], [46] have explored prompt rewriting strategies, where user-provided prompts are reformulated to address variability in linguistic style, length, and expressivity. Such approaches aim to improve alignment between textual descriptions and video outputs by standardizing or enriching the input language. However, existing practices in T2V prompt engineering remain largely model-specific. There is still lack of generalizable optimization strategies that can systematically guide prompt refinement across diverse models and tasks. To address the above issue, some RLHF-based prompt optimization methods [22], [25] mitigate model-specific variability in user prompts by training dedicated prompt rewriter through two-stage procedure: supervised ini2 Figure. 1: Overview of RAPO++. The framework couples training-dataaligned prompt refinement with test-time scaling to enhance Text-to-Video (T2V) generation without altering the generative backbone. Stage 1 RAPO: Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (Sec. 3). User prompts are augmented via retrieval-based relation graph and refactored by finetuned LLM, while frozen LLM provides alternative rewrites. discriminator then selects the best candidate, ensuring prompts align with training distributions while preserving intent. Stage 2 SSPO: Sample-Specific Prompt Optimization at Test-time (Sec. 4). Multiple candidates are evaluated by VLM verifiers and task-specific metrics, with misalignments guiding iterative refinement. This process enhances temporal coherence, fidelity, and semantic alignment during inference, and also yields prompt pairs for LLM fine-tuning. Stage 3: LLM Fine-Tuning & Evaluation (Sec. 4.2& 5). The prompt pairs collected from Stage 2 are used to fine-tune the LLM, further enhancing its generalization and robustness across models. The fine-tuned LLM is then validated across different benchmarks, demons"

Index TermsAudio-Visual Segmentation, Continual Sementatic Segmentation, Modality Entanglement I. INTRODUCTION Humans are inherently capable of continuously learning while retaining knowledge from previous tasks. For example, infants can progressively recognize new animals while remembering those they have already learned. This human ability has motivated extensive research into continual learning [1], which enables models to learn sequential tasks. Early work [2] [4] primarily focused on classification, employing techniques such as regularization or rehearsal to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Subsequent methods [5] have extended continual learning to semantic segmentation. However, when directly these applied to multi-modal (e.g. audio-visual) scenarios, single-modal methods exhibit suboptimal performance [6]. Recently, several methods [6][8] have extended continual learning to multi-modal scenarios. For example, AV-CIL [7] Yuyang Hong, Qi Yang, Zili Wang and Shiming Xiang are with the State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China, and also with the School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China (e-mail: hongyuyang2023@ia.ac.cn; yangqi2021@ia.ac.cn; wangzili2022@ia.ac.cn; smxiang@nlpr.ia.ac.cn). Tao Zhang and Kun Ding are with the State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China (e-mail: zhangtao2021@ia.ac.cn; kun.ding@ia.ac.cn). Zhaojin Fu and Bin Fan are with the School of Intelligent Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China (e-mail: d202410395@xs.ustb.edu.cn; bin.fan@ieee.org). Illustration of CAVS and two challenges. In the figure, Fig. 1. three sequential tasks are presented from top to bottom. Gray boxes: learned or background classes, light-orange boxes: target classes to be learned. Multimodal semantic drift occurs when learned class (e.g., darkgreen drum) is labeled as background in task t, despite the presence of its corresponding sound in the audio. This drift causes the model to suffer catastrophic forgetting of the modality semantic associations specific to the drum. Co-occurrence confusion occurs when, in previous task (e.g. task t), two classes frequently co-occur (guitar and woman). After learning new task, the model tends to misclassify the old classes (guitar) as the new ones (woman). proposes continual audio-visual classification method with dual similarity constraint enforcing both instance-level and class-level cross-modal semantic consistency. ContAV-Sep [8] proposes framework for audio-visual separation that incorporates cross-modal similarity distillation to preserve semantic consistency between modalities. Meanwhile, real-world applications require fine-grained audio-visual continual learning. For example, embodied intelligence needs to identify the source of vocalization from environmental audio-visual cues. However, existing methods primarily focus on coarse-grained audio-visual tasks and therefore fail to address fine-grained tasks, such as disentangling pixel-level visual features from audio signals under continual learning scenarios. Meanwhile, recent research [9][11] has explored finegrained modality entanglement between audio signals and visual features in audio-visual segmentation. AVSBench [9] establishes the first benchmark for aligning the pixel-level visual semantics with the corresponding audio signals. COMBO [11] further explores bilateral relations of three entanglements, pixel, modality, and temporal, to enhance the models representational capacity. However, audio-visual segmentation cannot be directly applied to continual learning scenarios, as it is designed for static settings. To this end, we introduce novel fine-grained multiJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, OCTOBER 2025 2 modal continual learning task, termed Continual Audio-Visual Segmentation (CAVS). Specifically, CAVS needs to perform audio-visual segmentation in sequential task setting while retaining knowledge of previously seen classes. To address CAVS, we reformulate the AVS [9], [10] framework and adapt classical continual semantic segmentation methods to the audio-visual context. Based on our observations, we identify two new challenges in fine-grained continual learning tasks: (1) Multi-modal semantic drift: Incorrect audio-visual semantic alignment (e.g. drum-background) due to mislabeling of learned classes as background exacerbates catastrophic forgetting. (2) Co-occurrence confusion: Frequent co-occurrence of categories leads to modality entanglement, for example, the a"

Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) perform video question answering by initiating temporal reasoning through cross-frame interactions, followed by video-language integration, and generate answers using effective information pathways while suppressing unnecessary attention edges.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis, we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

Calibrating large reasoning models with synthetic human-like thinking trajectories improves their efficiency and performance in machine translation evaluation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g., R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

Для решения этих проблем предложен метод калибровки LRM путём обучения на синтетических траекториях рассуждений, имитирующих человеческое мышление. Эксперименты на бенчмарках WMT24 показали, что подход сокращает вычислительные затраты на рассуждение в 35 раз при одновременном улучшении качества оценки для моделей размером от 7B до 32B параметров. Например, модель R1-Distill-Qwen-7B показала улучшение корреляции на 8.7 процентных пунктов, что демонстрирует потенциал калиброванных LRM для автоматической оценки машинного перевода."
