Although recent video-to-audio (V2A) systems have advanced fidelity and semantic coverage, they frequently entail heavy training pipelines or control stacks that limit practicality in production settings [5, 26, 32]. Broadly, prior work splits into two paths. Adapter-based methods (e.g., FoleyCrafter [37]) plug semantics and timing controllers into strong T2A generators, improving alignment without retraining large backbones. By contrast, end-to-end foundation V2A models demand far more data with tightly aligned videoaudio pairs to learn the audio prior, cross-modal mapping, and temporal synchrony simultaneously driving curation of massive paired corpora with heavy filtering (onset heuristics, CLAP/ImageBind screening, alignment checks) and representation-alignment losses [5, 26]. Scale is further hampered by real-world noise: dubbing, off-screen sources, background music, and imprecise timestamps degrade supervision and underrepresent long-tail events. We instead freeze strong T2A backbone and learn thin videoaudio bridge, attaining competitive alignment with far less data: our corpus uses 700k Kinetics700 clips, whereas HunyuanVideo Foley trains on 100k hours ( 3.0107 twelvesecond segments), i.e., 43 more paired data. At the other extreme, multimodal diffusion transformers (e.g., MMAudio [5], HunyuanVideoFoley [26] and others [4] [28] [13]) jointly train audio, video, and sometimes text streams end-to-end. Such approaches achieve impressive synchronization and coverage, but at the cost of massive curated datasets, high compute budgets, and reduced modularity. This paper proposes Foley Control, lightweight framework that targets the same alignment benefits while preserving the practicality of frozen generative backbones. Our key idea is to connect VJEPA2 [1] video embeddings to frozen Stable Audio Open DiT [7] by inserting collaboration layers compact, video-conditioned cross-attention modules placed inside existing transformer blocks. This placement is deliberate: video cross-attention is applied after the models original text cross-attention, so text prompts first establish high-level semantics and structure, and video then refines temporal 1 grounding and localized dynamics. By freezing the remaining parameters of the DiT blocks, we retain the strong generative prior learned from large-scale audiotext corpora and focus the trainable capacity on cross-modal synchronization rather than relearning audio generation. From an architectural perspective, we employ streamlined integration strategy in which V-JEPA2 embeddings are pooled into compact grid representation and injected through lightweight crossattention modules placed inside the frozen DiT blocks. This design ensures that video information refines the audio latent trajectory without altering the established text-conditioning pathway. Rotary position embeddings (RoPE) [27] further enhance temporal grounding by providing ordering signals across modalities, eliminating the need for heavier synchronization mechanisms. The resulting architecture remains compact yet expressive, scaling effectively to longer contexts and diverse scenes while preserving prompt-driven controllability. Taken together, these elements provide practical route to high-quality Foley generation: reuse strong, frozen T2A backbone for audio fidelity and prompt control, and add just enough trainable capacity to align timing and dynamics to the video.FoleyCrafter. Early neural Foley systems learn to synthesize sounds that are semantically and temporally aligned with visual inputs, but often depend on limited audiovisual data and struggle to preserve high audio fidelity. FoleyCrafter [37] addresses this by plugging lightweight controllers into strong text-to-audio backbone, thereby retaining audio quality while improving videoaudio alignment. Concretely, it builds on U-Netbased V2A generator (in the spirit of AuFusion [34]) and employs multiple control streams: semantic adapter that injects video/text features throughout the U-Net (early, middle, and late blocks), and timestamp/onset controller that is applied primarily in late layers to sharpen synchronization around transient events. Event timing cues are provided by separate timestamp detection model , whose outputs modulate the diffusion steps to align onsets without altering the pretrained backbone. This division of laborfrozen backbone for fidelity, semantic control across the network, and late-layer timing refinementyields stronger alignment under modest compute. MMAudio. MMAudio [5] introduces unified, from-scratch multimodal training paradigm that jointly leverages audiotext and audiovideo pairs under conditional flow-matching objective. hybrid architecturemultimodal DiT blocks followed by audio-only blockssupports scalable data mixing and strong semantic alignment, while synchronization module operating via high frame-rate visual features further improves temporal precision. relate"

Foley Control uses a small cross-attention bridge to synchronize video and audio without retraining, achieving competitive alignment with fewer parameters and maintaining modularity.  					AI-generated summary 				 Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio modalities (e.g., speech).

SIC, an iterative prompt sanitization method, enhances the security of tool-augmented LLM agents by repeatedly inspecting and cleaning incoming data to prevent prompt injection attacks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic systems that interact with an external environment; this makes them susceptible to prompt injections when dealing with untrusted data. To overcome this limitation, we propose SIC (Soft Instruction Control)-a simple yet effective iterative prompt sanitization loop designed for tool-augmented LLM agents. Our method repeatedly inspects incoming data for instructions that could compromise agent behavior. If such content is found, the malicious content is rewritten, masked, or removed, and the result is re-evaluated. The process continues until the input is clean or a maximum iteration limit is reached; if imperative instruction-like content remains, the agent halts to ensure security. By allowing multiple passes, our approach acknowledges that individual rewrites may fail but enables the system to catch and correct missed injections in later steps. Although immediately useful, worst-case analysis shows that SIC is not infallible; strong adversary can still get a 15% ASR by embedding non-imperative workflows. This nonetheless raises the bar.

"SIC, an iterative prompt sanitization method, enhances the security of tool-augmented LLM agents by repeatedly inspecting and cleaning incoming data to prevent prompt injection attacks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic systems that interact with an external environment; this makes them susceptible to prompt injections when dealing with untrusted data. To overcome this limitation, we propose SIC (Soft Instruction Control)-a simple yet effective iterative prompt sanitization loop designed for tool-augmented LLM agents. Our method repeatedly inspects incoming data for instructions that could compromise agent behavior. If such content is found, the malicious content is rewritten, masked, or removed, and the result is re-evaluated. The process continues until the input is clean or a maximum iteration limit is reached; if imperative instruction-like content remains, the agent halts to ensure security. By allowing multiple passes, our approach acknowledges that individual rewrites may fail but enables the system to catch and correct missed injections in later steps. Although immediately useful, worst-case analysis shows that SIC is not infallible; strong adversary can still get a 15% ASR by embedding non-imperative workflows. This nonetheless raises the bar."

Rollout Routing Replay (R3) stabilizes reinforcement learning training in Mixture-of-Experts models by reducing discrepancies between training and inference routing behaviors.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions, the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

R3 записывает распределения роутинга во время инференса и воспроизводит их при обучении, существенно снижая расхождение KL-дивергенции между политиками.
