Text:"5 2 0 2 4 1 ] . [ 1 3 8 4 0 1 . 4 0 5 2 : r REPA-E: Unlocking VAE for End-to-End Tuning with Latent Diffusion Transformers Xingjian Lengα Jaskirat Singhα Yunzhong Houα Zhenchang Xingβ Saining Xieχ Liang Zhengα αAustralian National University βData61 CSIRO χNew York University Figure 1. Can we unlock VAE for end-to-end tuning with latent-diffusion models? Traditional deep learning wisdom dictates that end-to-end training is often preferable when possible. However, latent diffusion models usually only update the generator network while keeping the variational auto-encoder (VAE) fixed (a). This is because directly using the diffusion loss to update the VAE (b) causes the latent space to collapse. We show that while direct diffusion-loss is ineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the representationalignment (REPA) loss allowing both encoder and diffusion model to be jointly tuned during the training process (c). Notably, this allows for significantly accelerated training; speeding up training by over 17 and 45 over REPA and vanilla training recipes, respectively (d). "

In this paper we tackle a fundamental question: "Can we train latent diffusion models together with the variational auto-encoder (VAE) tokenizer in an end-to-end manner?" Traditional deep-learning wisdom dictates that end-to-end training is often preferable when possible. However, for latent diffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and diffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a degradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is ineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the representation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model to be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the proposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up diffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training recipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with REPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure and downstream generation performance. In terms of final performance, our approach sets a new state-of-the-art; achieving FID of 1.26 and 1.83 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256 x 256.
