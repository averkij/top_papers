The crux of AlayaDB is that it abstracts the attention computation and cache management for LLM inference into query processing procedure, and optimizes the performance via native query optimizer.

CCS Concepts Information systems Data management systems; Computing methodologies Artificial intelligence. Keywords Vector database, Large language model, Machine learning systems Many solutions have been proposed to optimize these metrics in long-context LLM inference. They can be classified into three categories: (i) coupled architecture; (ii) KV cache disaggregation; and (iii) retrieval-based sparse attention. vLLM [42], SGLang [69] and HuggingFace transformers [61] are the most widely-used LLM inference systems in (i) coupled architecture.
