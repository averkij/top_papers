We introduce SIFT (Speech Instruction Fine-Tuning), a 50M-example dataset designed for instruction fine-tuning and pre-training of speech-text large language models (LLMs). SIFT-50M is built from publicly available speech corpora, which collectively contain 14K hours of speech, and leverages LLMs along with off-the-shelf expert models. The dataset spans five languages, encompassing a diverse range of speech understanding as well as controllable speech generation instructions. Using SIFT-50M, we train SIFT-LLM, which outperforms existing speech-text LLMs on instruction-following benchmarks while achieving competitive performance on foundational speech tasks. To support further research, we also introduce EvalSIFT, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of speech-text LLMs.

Reconstructing 4D dynamic scenes from casually captured monocular videos is valuable but highly challenging, as each timestamp is observed from a single viewpoint. We introduce Vivid4D, a novel approach that enhances 4D monocular video synthesis by augmenting observation views - synthesizing multi-view videos from a monocular input. Unlike existing methods that either solely leverage geometric priors for supervision or use generative priors while overlooking geometry, we integrate both. This reformulates view augmentation as a video inpainting task, where observed views are warped into new viewpoints based on monocular depth priors. To achieve this, we train a video inpainting model on unposed web videos with synthetically generated masks that mimic warping occlusions, ensuring spatially and temporally consistent completion of missing regions. To further mitigate inaccuracies in monocular depth priors, we introduce an iterative view augmentation strategy and a robust reconstruction loss. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively improves monocular 4D scene reconstruction and completion.

Color plays an important role in human perception and usually provides critical clues in visual reasoning. However, it is unclear whether and how vision-language models (VLMs) can perceive, understand, and leverage color as humans. This paper introduces ColorBench, an innovative benchmark meticulously crafted to assess the capabilities of VLMs in color understanding, including color perception, reasoning, and robustness. By curating a suite of diverse test scenarios, with grounding in real applications, ColorBench evaluates how these models perceive colors, infer meanings from color-based cues, and maintain consistent performance under varying color transformations. Through an extensive evaluation of 32 VLMs with varying language models and vision encoders, our paper reveals some undiscovered findings: (i) The scaling law (larger models are better) still holds on ColorBench, while the language model plays a more important role than the vision encoder. (ii) However, the performance gaps across models are relatively small, indicating that color understanding has been largely neglected by existing VLMs. (iii) CoT reasoning improves color understanding accuracies and robustness, though they are vision-centric tasks. (iv) Color clues are indeed leveraged by VLMs on ColorBench but they can also mislead models in some tasks. These findings highlight the critical limitations of current VLMs and underscore the need to enhance color comprehension. Our ColorBenchcan serve as a foundational tool for advancing the study of human-level color understanding of multimodal AI.

This article discusses the role of color in how humans and vision-language models (VLMs) perceive and understand the world. It introduces ColorBench, a new benchmark for testing VLMs' color understanding skills. The study finds that while larger models perform better, current VLMs generally neglect color understanding. It also shows that using Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning can improve color task accuracy. The authors hope ColorBench will help advance research in this area.
