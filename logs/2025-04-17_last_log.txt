INTRODUCTION ARGE-scale scene high-fidelity and real-time novel view synthesis is essential for many applications, including autonomous driving [1][3], virtual reality [4], [5], remote sensing photogrammetry [6], [7], and embodied intelligence. Recently, prominent novel view synthesis approaches have fallen into two main categories: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods [8][11] and Gaussian Splatting-based techniques [12][14]. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [8], due to their capability in high-fidelity rendering through 2 implicit representation, have been extended to large-scale scene reconstruction tasks [15][17]. Although Block-NeRF [17] achieved large-scale reconstruction of San Francisco neighborhoods, the scene representation using MLP networks as the smallest unit lacks flexibility and struggles with slow rendering speeds. 3D Gaussian Splatting [12], as an alternative, demonstrates more significant potential, particularly with its fast rendering speed. Explicit point clouds scene representation makes it more scalable for large-scale scenes [18][21]. The divide-and-conquer paradigm [15], [19], [20] has become the mainstream of large-scale scene novel view synthesis constrained by hardware VRAM resources. By dividing the scene into subregions, the reconstruction speed has been significantly improved in multi-GPU parallel. This paradigm consists of three key stages: scene partitioning, individual block optimization, and fusion of block reconstruction results. These stages exhibit strictly sequential dependency, meaning the input of each subsequent stage entirely relies on the output of the preceding phase. The quality of the final reconstruction result is contingent upon the effectiveness of each stage. Although existing research methods have established baseline, challenges remain in these steps, including imbalanced reconstruction complexity across blocks, supervision mismatch in block-wise optimization, and quality degradation in fusion results. The imbalanced reconstruction complexity across blocks arises from unreasonable scene partitioning, which reduces the efficiency of large-scale scene reconstruction, especially on multi-GPU devices. As illustrated in Fig.2 (a), evenly dividing the scene into grids ignores the content disparity of different regions. When partitioning the scene, two critical factors must be considered: the granularity of block division and the computational loads across blocks. The former requires attention to the complexity of different scene regions, with higher granularity for areas of interest or greater complexity. The latter aims to balance the computational loads across blocks, thereby reducing the training time of the entire scene in multi-GPU. VastGaussian [19] introduced progressive data partitioning strategy, which divides the scene based on camera positions. DOGS [21] improved VastGaussians partitioning method by proposing recursive method to balance computational loads across blocks. However, scene partitioning based on camera positions is limited by the spatial distribution of cameras and struggles to generalize to scenes with more complex viewpoint distributions. CityGaussian [20] firstly trains coarse Gaussian as the scene prior, using it to partition the scene into grids. Nevertheless, this partitioning method requires pre-training coarse Gaussian model, which does not fully decouple scene scale from the optimization process. The supervision mismatch in block-wise optimization leads to artifacts within individual blocks, degrading scene reconstruction quality. NeRF/Gaussian-based scene representations employ an end-to-end optimization pipeline, where the parameters of the scene representation are optimized by constructing an objective function that compares ground-truth images with rendered images. However, under the divide-andconquer paradigm for large-scale scene reconstruction, the lack of entire scene representation leads to visibility problems during individual block optimization. As illustrated in Fig.2 (b), after scene partitioning, the content of training view may be distributed across multiple blocks, indicating that single block only corresponds to portion of the image scope. When reconstructing the concerned block, mismatc"

The recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable potential in novel view synthesis tasks. The divide-and-conquer paradigm has enabled large-scale scene reconstruction, but significant challenges remain in scene partitioning, optimization, and merging processes. This paper introduces BlockGaussian, a novel framework incorporating a content-aware scene partition strategy and visibility-aware block optimization to achieve efficient and high-quality large-scale scene reconstruction. Specifically, our approach considers the content-complexity variation across different regions and balances computational load during scene partitioning, enabling efficient scene reconstruction. To tackle the supervision mismatch issue during independent block optimization, we introduce auxiliary points during individual block optimization to align the ground-truth supervision, which enhances the reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-view geometry constraint that effectively mitigates rendering degradation caused by airspace floaters during block merging. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction efficiency and rendering quality, with a 5x speedup in optimization and an average PSNR improvement of 1.21 dB on multiple benchmarks. Notably, BlockGaussian significantly reduces computational requirements, enabling large-scale scene reconstruction on a single 24GB VRAM device.

"The recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable potential in novel view synthesis tasks. The divide-and-conquer paradigm has enabled large-scale scene reconstruction, but significant challenges remain in scene partitioning, optimization, and merging processes. This paper introduces BlockGaussian, a novel framework incorporating a content-aware scene partition strategy and visibility-aware block optimization to achieve efficient and high-quality large-scale scene reconstruction. Specifically, our approach considers the content-complexity variation across different regions and balances computational load during scene partitioning, enabling efficient scene reconstruction. To tackle the supervision mismatch issue during independent block optimization, we introduce auxiliary points during individual block optimization to align the ground-truth supervision, which enhances the reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-view geometry constraint that effectively mitigates rendering degradation caused by airspace floaters during block merging. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction efficiency and rendering quality, with a 5x speedup in optimization and an average PSNR improvement of 1.21 dB on multiple benchmarks. Notably, BlockGaussian significantly reduces computational requirements, enabling large-scale scene reconstruction on a single 24GB VRAM device.
