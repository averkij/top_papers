[ 1 3 1 7 6 1 . 7 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Robot completes new task guided by previously self-generated memory. We propose grounding VLMs through memory generated by the robot itself from direct hardware experiments, establishing awareness of the robots own capability. When executing novel task, the robot keeps short-term memory that helps the robot reflect and complete the task (illustrated in the grey clip). The experience is then stored as long-term memory and retrieved to guide the VLMs task planning whenever similar scenario is encountered (illustrated in the main figure). Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have been widely adopted in robotics to enable autonomous planning. However, grounding VLMs, originally trained on internet data, to diverse real-world robots remains challenge. This paper presents EXPTEACH, framework that grounds VLMs to physical robots by building self-generated memory of real-world experiences. In EXPTEACH, the VLM autonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts robot behaviors in closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this process are then summarized into long-term memory, enabling retrieval of learned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, EXPTEACH enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with an on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection improves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and observe the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative tool use.

"Vision-language models (VLMs) have been widely adopted in robotics to enable autonomous planning. However, grounding VLMs, originally trained on internet data, to diverse real-world robots remains a challenge. This paper presents ExpTeach, a framework that grounds VLMs to physical robots by building a self-generated memory of real-world experiences. In ExpTeach, the VLM autonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts robot behaviors in a closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this process are then summarized into a long-term memory, enabling retrieval of learned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, ExpTeach enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with an on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection improves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and observe the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative tool use. Across extensive tests on 12 real-world scenarios (including eight unseen ones), we find that grounding with long-term memory boosts single-trial success rates from 22% to 80%, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of ExpTeach."
