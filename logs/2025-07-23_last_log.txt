Text:"Zebra-CoT: Dataset for Interleaved Charles L. Wang Vision-Language Reasoning Ang Li Peng Guo Wang Bill Zhu Furong Huang Columbia University New York University Equal contribution Tom Goldstein Micah Goldblum University of Maryland Vatsal Sharan Kaiyu Yue Zikui Cai Ollie Liu Deqing Fu Robin Jia Willie Neiswanger University of Southern California 5 2 0 2 2 2 ] . [ 1 6 4 7 6 1 . 7 0 5 2 : r Abstract: Humans often use visual aids, for example diagrams or sketches, when solving complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual Chain of Thought (visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce Zebra-CoT, diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations. Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields model that generates high-quality interleaved visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoTs effectiveness for developing multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to support development and evaluation of visual CoT.

ThinkAct, a dual-system framework, uses reinforced visual latent planning to enable high-level reasoning and robust action execution in vision-language-action tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.

MegaScience, a large-scale dataset of scientific reasoning questions, enhances the performance and training efficiency of AI models compared to existing datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Scientific reasoning is critical for developing AI scientists and supporting human researchers in advancing the frontiers of natural science discovery. However, the open-source community has primarily focused on mathematics and coding while neglecting the scientific domain, largely due to the absence of open, large-scale, high-quality, verifiable scientific reasoning datasets. To bridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring truthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific textbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific disciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of high-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed through systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection methodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available scientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system covering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks, incorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve superior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths compared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which significantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average performance. In addition, MegaScience exhibits greater effectiveness for larger and stronger models, suggesting a scaling benefit for scientific tuning. We release our data curation pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and seven trained models to the community to advance scientific reasoning research.

"MegaScience, a large-scale dataset of scientific reasoning questions, enhances the performance and training efficiency of AI models compared to existing datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 Scientific reasoning is critical for developing AI scientists and supporting human researchers in advancing the frontiers of natural science discovery. However, the open-source community has primarily focused on mathematics and coding while neglecting the scientific domain, largely due to the absence of open, large-scale, high-quality, verifiable scientific reasoning datasets. To bridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring truthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific textbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific disciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of high-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed through systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection methodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available scientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system covering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks, incorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve superior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths compared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which significantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average performance. In addition, MegaScience exhibits greater effectiveness for larger and stronger models, suggesting a scaling benefit for scientific tuning. We release our data curation pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and seven trained models to the community to advance scientific reasoning research."

Humans often use visual aids, for example diagrams or sketches, when solving complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce Zebra-CoT, a diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations. Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to support development and evaluation of visual CoT.

HOComp uses MLLMs and attention mechanisms to achieve seamless human-object interactions with consistent appearances in image compositing.  					AI-generated summary 				 While existing image-guided composition methods may help insert a foreground object onto a user-specified region of a background image, achieving natural blending inside the region with the rest of the image unchanged, we observe that these existing methods often struggle in synthesizing seamless interaction-aware compositions when the task involves human-object interactions. In this paper, we first propose HOComp, a novel approach for compositing a foreground object onto a human-centric background image, while ensuring harmonious interactions between the foreground object and the background person and their consistent appearances. Our approach includes two key designs: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG), which utilizes MLLMs to identify the interaction region as well as the interaction type (e.g., holding and lefting) to provide coarse-to-fine constraints to the generated pose for the interaction while incorporating human pose landmarks to track action variations and enforcing fine-grained pose constraints; and (2) Detail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP), which unifies a shape-aware attention modulation mechanism, a multi-view appearance loss, and a background consistency loss to ensure consistent shapes/textures of the foreground and faithful reproduction of the background human. We then propose the first dataset, named Interaction-aware Human-Object Composition (IHOC), for the task. Experimental results on our dataset show that HOComp effectively generates harmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances, and outperforms relevant methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for academic literature retrieval. However, existing systems often rely on rigid pipelines and exhibit limited reasoning capabilities. We introduce SPAR, a multi-agent framework that incorporates RefChain-based query decomposition and query evolution to enable more flexible and effective search. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we also construct SPARBench, a challenging benchmark with expert-annotated relevance labels. Experimental results demonstrate that SPAR substantially outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to +56% F1 on AutoScholar and +23% F1 on SPARBench over the best-performing baseline. Together, SPAR and SPARBench provide a scalable, interpretable, and high-performing foundation for advancing research in scholarly retrieval.

"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for academic literature retrieval. However, existing systems often rely on rigid pipelines and exhibit limited reasoning capabilities. We introduce SPAR, a multi-agent framework that incorporates RefChain-based query decomposition and query evolution to enable more flexible and effective search. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we also construct SPARBench, a challenging benchmark with expert-annotated relevance labels. Experimental results demonstrate that SPAR substantially outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to +56% F1 on AutoScholar and +23% F1 on SPARBench over the best-performing baseline. Together, SPAR and SPARBench provide a scalable, interpretable, and high-performing foundation for advancing research in scholarly retrieval. Code and data will be available at: https://github.com/xiaofengShi/SPAR"
