Text:"5 2 0 2 2 2 ] . [ 1 2 3 6 6 1 . 7 0 5 2 : r Step-Audio 2 Technical ReportThis paper presents Step-Audio 2, an end-to-end multi-modal large language model designed for industry-strength audio understanding and speech conversation. By integrating latent audio encoder and reasoning-centric reinforcement learning (RL), Step-Audio 2 achieves promising performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and audio understanding. To facilitate genuine end-to-end speech conversation, Step-Audio 2 incorporates the generation of discrete audio tokens into language modeling, significantly enhancing its responsiveness to paralinguistic information such as speaking styles and emotions. To effectively leverage the rich textual and acoustic knowledge in real-world data, Step-Audio 2 integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and is able to call external tools such as web search to mitigate hallucination and audio search to switch timbres. Trained on millions of hours of speech and audio data, Step-Audio 2 delivers intelligence and expressiveness across diverse conversational scenarios. Evaluation results demonstrate that Step-Audio 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various audio understanding and conversational benchmarks compared to other open-source and commercial solutions. Please visit https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step-Audio2 for more information.With the rapid development of large language models and audio processing technology, large audio language models (LALMs) have demonstrated their superiority over conventional approaches in various speech and audio processing tasks. GPT-4o is first introduced and is pioneering the development of end-to-end speech interaction without intermediate textual conversions. Subsequently, many open-sourced LALMs [9, 13, 16, 18, 21, 31, 32, 49, 71, 72, 74, 77] are emerged, advancing multi-modal large language model capabilities in various speech and audio domains. Among these approaches, Qwen-Audio [12] and Qwen2-Audio [13] perform audio analysis and generate textual responses to speech instructions. Qwen2.5-Omni [74] implements thinker-talker architecture to enable full-duplex I/O during speech conversations. More recently, Kimi-Audio [18] has achieved impressive results on multiple speech and audio understanding benchmarks. In parallel, we have introduced Step-Audio [32] and Step-Audio-AQAA [31], the first LALMs to unify speech understanding and generation through discrete audio tokens at scale of 130 billion parameters. However, existing LALMs still face challenges in achieving natural and intelligent speech interaction. Previous LALMs such as Spirit LM [49] and GLM-4-Voice [77] mainly focus on aligning the semantic information in speech inputs to text modal, neglecting the para-linguistic information which is also crucial for intentional understanding. Although LALMs including Qwen-Audio [12], Qwen2-Audio [13] and Audio Flamingo series [24, 25, 43] are capable of comprehending such information, they typically generate only textual outputs and fail to further utilize this capability Step-Audio 2 Technical Report Figure 1: Performance comparision of GPT-4o Audio1, Kimi-Audio [18], Qwen-Omni2 and Step-Audio 2 and on various benchmarks. to produce coherent and expressive responses in speech conversations. Moreover, due to the complexities of multi-modal modeling, existing LALMs frequently suffer from hallucination and offer limited choices of timbres and speaking styles [16, 18], lacking access to real-world textual and acoustic knowledge. To address these issues and step into the next generation of multi-modal large language models, we present Step-Audio 2, an end-to-end large audio language model with industry-strength audio perception and speech interaction. Step-Audio 2 directly processes raw audio as input and outputs discrete text and audio tokens and has fewer parameters than Step-Audio [32]. Beyond capturing semantic information in speech, the model also comprehends para-linguistic and non-vocal information in audio. By leveraging chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL), Step-Audio 2 further utilizes such multi-modal information to generate expressive speech responses coherent to different conversation scenarios. To ground the model with real-world knowledge, StepAudio 2 incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and the capability to utilize various external tools, including web search and audio search, to provide more reliable and expressive responses. Specifically, we present an audio search as tool unique to LALMs, enabling seamless speech retrieval via voice instructions and allowing the model to switch timbres and speaking styles based on the retrieved speech. 1GPT-4o Audio is evaluated with gpt-4o-transcribe for ASR and gpt-4o-audio-preview-2025-06-03 for others via official API. 2Qwen-Omni is evaluated with Qwen2.5-Omni for ASR, MMAU and speech-to-text translation, and qwen-omni-turbo-2025-0326 for others via official API. 2 Step-Audio 2 Technical Report To ensure its intelligence and expressiveness in diverse conversational scenarios, we carefully design multi-stage training strategy to train Step-Audio 2 on 680 billion tokens of text data and 8 million hours of real and synthesized audio data. Evaluation results shown in Figure 1 demonstrate that Step-Audio 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in series of audio tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) on multiple languages, audio understanding, speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) and speech-to-speech conversation.Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) [4, 29, 50, 51] have extended their application to wide range of speech and audio understanding tasks, such as audio captioning, sound event detection, automatic speech recognition, audio classification, and audio-driven creative generation. prevalent approach [13, 17, 27, 28, 48, 61] involves pairing speech encoders with lightweight, trainable adapters that project audio features into textual embedding space compatible with LLMs. Building on this foundation, recent studies have further explored how to incorporate paralinguistic information such as emotion, intonation and speaker style, enabling LLMs to move beyond pure linguistic comprehension. For instance, ParalinGPT [48] focuses on enhancing powerful text-based language model by integrating continuous speech embeddings, enabling it to capture paralinguistic signals such as emotion and prosody.

ObjectGS combines 3D scene reconstruction with semantic understanding by modeling individual objects as neural Gaussians, achieving superior performance in segmentation and integration with applications like mesh extraction and scene editing.  					AI-generated summary 				 3D Gaussian Splatting is renowned for its high-fidelity reconstructions and real-time novel view synthesis, yet its lack of semantic understanding limits object-level perception. In this work, we propose ObjectGS, an object-aware framework that unifies 3D scene reconstruction with semantic understanding. Instead of treating the scene as a unified whole, ObjectGS models individual objects as local anchors that generate neural Gaussians and share object IDs, enabling precise object-level reconstruction. During training, we dynamically grow or prune these anchors and optimize their features, while a one-hot ID encoding with a classification loss enforces clear semantic constraints. We show through extensive experiments that ObjectGS not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary and panoptic segmentation tasks, but also integrates seamlessly with applications like mesh extraction and scene editing.

With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), developing effective critic modules for precise guidance has become crucial yet challenging. In this paper, we initially demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning for building critic modules (which is widely adopted in current solutions) fails to genuinely enhance models' critique abilities, producing superficial critiques with insufficient reflections and verifications. To unlock the unprecedented critique capabilities, we propose RefCritic, a long-chain-of-thought critic module based on reinforcement learning with dual rule-based rewards: (1) instance-level correctness of solution judgments and (2) refinement accuracies of the policy model based on critiques, aiming to generate high-quality evaluations with actionable feedback that effectively guides model refinement. We evaluate RefCritic on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B across five benchmarks. On critique and refinement settings, RefCritic demonstrates consistent advantages across all benchmarks, e.g., 6.8\% and 7.2\% gains on AIME25 for the respective base models. Notably, under majority voting, policy models filtered by RefCritic show superior scaling with increased voting numbers. Moreover, despite training on solution-level supervision, RefCritic outperforms step-level supervised approaches on ProcessBench, a benchmark to identify erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning.
