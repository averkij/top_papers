Chest x-rays (CXRs) are used for diagnosis of COVID-19, but few studies predict the severity of patients condition from CXRs. In this study, we produce large COVID severity dataset by merging three sources and investigate the efficacy of transfer learning using ImageNetand CXR-pretrained models and vision transformers (ViTs) in both severity regression and classification tasks. pretrained DenseNet161 model performed the best on the three class severity prediction problem, reaching 80% accuracy overall and 77.3%, 83.9%, and 70% on mild, moderate and severe cases, respectively. The ViT had the best regression results1, with mean absolute error of 0.5676 compared to radiologist-predicted severity scores. The projects source code is publicly available2. 1. Introduction The SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) pandemic that began in late 2019 had seismic effect on social patterns, technologies and health-care. COVID-19 often presents as pneumonia (COVID-pneumonia) and can quickly become lifethreatening. Medical establishments across the world are still feeling the effects of increased disease burdens and shortages of qualified personnel. For healthcare practitioners needing to triage and decide where best to allocate their resources, cheap, scalable and easy-to-administer tests are essential. Molecular tests indicate whether or not patient has COVID-19 but do not give an indication of its sever1Universite de Montreal, Canada 2Mila Quebec AI Institute, Canada. Correspondence to: Luis Lara <luis.lara@mila.quebec>. Copyright 2023 by the author(s). 1https://huggingface.co/ludolara/vit-COV ID-19-severity 2https://github.com/stwhitfield/covid-sev erity ity. Chest X-rays (CXRs) are favoured when diagnosing suspected COVID-19 (Rubin et al., 2020) because they are relatively cheap, can be taken bedside and can give an indication of severity. Machine Learning (ML) technologies have been suggested since the beginning of the pandemic, and applied in emergency rooms (Shamout et al., 2021), as means of reducing the burden on healthcare workers by increasing accuracy, accelerating diagnosis and suggesting outcomes. At this point, many ML studies have classified COVID-19 vs. nonCOVID-19 patients with high accuracy (for example, (Khan et al., 2020; Minaee et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2020; Oh et al., 2020; Tabik et al., 2020; Chakraborty et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020a; Elkorany & Elsharkawy, 2021; Bhattacharyya et al., 2022; Nasir et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2021a)) but far fewer studies stratify patients by disease severity (Cohen et al., 2020a; Le Dinh et al., 2022; Shamout et al., 2021; Signoroni et al., 2021; Wong et al., 2021; Zandehshahvar et al., 2021) despite it being identified early as critical task (Cohen et al., 2020c). This is partly because obtaining radiologist scores of severity adds an additional cost barrier, so fewer COVID CXR datasets contain this knowledge and are suitable for the task. The contributions of the current study are: 1) Building large COVID severity dataset by combining datasets with different severity scores into single score. 2) Improving on state-of-the-art predictions of COVID severity for the regression task. 3) Comparing the performance of models pretrained on general images (e.g. ImageNet) with models specifically trained on CXRs. We obtain competitive results in the classification (80% overall accuracy) and regression (0.5676 mean absolute error) tasks using pretrained models fine-tuned on our dataset. Development of ML models that accurately predict severity for COVID-19, while providing graphical explanations of its decisions, is useful for physicians to prioritize patients with the best chance of recovery or to intervene at an earlier time point, saving the health system money, helping patients and unburdening health care professionals. Diagnosing Medical Images for COVID-19 2. Related work Severity scoring X-rays of patients with COVID-19 show opacity correlating with the degree of severity of the disease (Wong et al., 2020). Fluid build-up in lungs with COVID-pneumonia reduces the transmittance of the x-ray, resulting in cloudier/more opaque lung images Figure 1. Different scoring systems have been developed to attempt to quantify this severity; the most relevant to the current study are the Brixia score (Borghesi & Maroldi, 2020; Signoroni et al., 2021) and the opacity score (Cohen et al., 2020c;a). Figure 1. Lung opacity often increases with COVID severity Left to right: normal, moderate and severe levels of opacity in lung CXRs of patients with COVID. Early in the pandemic, medical services in Brescia, Italy adopted the Brixia score (Borghesi & Maroldi, 2020), semi-quantitative metric where lungs are divided into six regions, with each region assigned rating from 0 to 3 based on severity as assessed by radiologist (Borghesi & Maroldi, 2020; Signoroni et al., 2021). modified version of the Brixia score, with higher spatial resolution, is additionally associated with severity (Jensen et al., 2022). Cohen et al. compiled an early COVID-19 CXR dataset (Cohen et al., 2020c) that has been hugely influential in the CXR COVID-19 prediction space (Garcia Santa Cruz et al., 2021). subset of their data (93 images) is accompanied by score for degree of opacity (DO) (scored 0-6 for both lungs together) reflects the intensity of opacity: 0 = no opacity; 1 = ground glass opacity; 2 = consolidation; 3 = white-out (Cohen et al., 2020a). Since the degree of opacity can be mapped to the Brixia score by linear regression (Signoroni et al., 2021), we chose to use the opacity score as unifying score for our study. Prediction tasks Authors generally take one of two approaches to severity prediction: treat the problem 1) as classification task, and predict whether patients fall into mild, moderate or severe categories (Le Dinh et al., 2022; Tabik et al., 2020; Zandehshahvar et al., 2021; Gourdeau et al., 2022a), or 2) as regression task and aim to match as closely as possible the scores of professional radiologists (Cohen et al., 2020a; Signoroni et al., 2021). Due to the evolving nature of the COVID pandemic,"

Quality estimation is omnipresent in machine translation, for both evaluation and generation. Unfortunately, quality estimation models are often opaque and computationally expensive, making them impractical to be part of large-scale pipelines. In this work, we tackle two connected challenges: (1) reducing the cost of quality estimation at scale, and (2) developing an inexpensive uncertainty estimation method for quality estimation. To address the latter, we introduce Instant Confidence COMET, an uncertainty-aware quality estimation model that matches the performance of previous approaches at a fraction of their costs. We extend this to Early-Exit COMET, a quality estimation model that can compute quality scores and associated confidences already at early model layers, allowing us to early-exit computations and reduce evaluation costs. We also apply our model to machine translation reranking. We combine Early-Exit COMET with an upper confidence bound bandit algorithm to find the best candidate from a large pool without having to run the full evaluation model on all candidates. In both cases (evaluation and reranking) our methods reduce the required compute by 50% with very little degradation in performance.

The COVID-19 pandemic strained healthcare resources and prompted discussion about how machine learning can alleviate physician burdens and contribute to diagnosis. Chest x-rays (CXRs) are used for diagnosis of COVID-19, but few studies predict the severity of a patient's condition from CXRs. In this study, we produce a large COVID severity dataset by merging three sources and investigate the efficacy of transfer learning using ImageNet- and CXR-pretrained models and vision transformers (ViTs) in both severity regression and classification tasks. A pretrained DenseNet161 model performed the best on the three class severity prediction problem, reaching 80% accuracy overall and 77.3%, 83.9%, and 70% on mild, moderate and severe cases, respectively. The ViT had the best regression results, with a mean absolute error of 0.5676 compared to radiologist-predicted severity scores. The project's source code is publicly available.
