Text:"5 2 0 2 8 1 ] . m [ 1 4 7 0 3 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r a Omer Angel Brett Kolesnik Emmanuel Jacob Grégory Miermont February 2025 Abstract The Brownian sphere is random metric space, homeomorphic to the two-dimensional sphere, which arises as the universal scaling limit of many types of random planar maps. The direct construction of the Brownian sphere is via continuous analogue of the CoriVauquelin Schaeffer (CVS) bijection. The CVS bijection maps labeled trees to planar maps, and the continuous version maps Aldous continuum random tree with Brownian labels (the Brownian snake) to the Brownian sphere. In this work, we describe the inverse of the continuous CVS bijection, by constructing the Brownian snake as measurable function of the Brownian sphere. Special care is needed to work with the orientation of the Brownian sphere. The CoriVauquelinSchaeffer (CVS) bijection [8, 24] is correspondence between labeled trees and rooted and pointed quadrangulations of sphere, where by pointed we mean that an additional vertex, other than the root, has been distinguished. Given (rooted and pointed) quadrangulation, the University of British Columbia, Department of Mathematics École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, Unité de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées University of Warwick, Department of Statistics École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, Unité de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées, and Institut Universitaire de France 1 inverse CVS bijection yields labeled plane tree, which is naturally embedded in the sphere, together with the map. continuum analogue of the CVS bijection may be obtained by associating metric measure space (X, d, µ) with pair of real-valued functions (f, g), where should be interpreted as the contour function of some R-tree Tf , and as label function defined on Tf . When the pair of functions is random, with law given by the Brownian snake [11], the resulting random metric space is called the Brownian sphere [14, 19].

Index TermsImage Quality Assessment, AI-Generated Images, Multimodal Large Language Models I. INTRODUCTION recent years, flourishing of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has sparked significant advancements in modalities such as text, image, audio, and even video. Among these, AI-Generated Image (AGI) has garnered considerable interest from both researchers and the public. Plenty of remarkable AGI models and online services, such as StableDiffusion1, Midjourney2, and FLUX3, offer users an excellent creative experience. However, users often remain critical of the quality of the AGI due to image distortions or mismatches with user intentions. Consequently, methods for assessing the quality of AGI are becoming increasingly crucial to help improve the generative capabilities of these models. Work is done by the first author during intership at Hefei High-Dimensional Data Technology Co.,Ltd. (Corresponding author: Zhihua Wei.) Chuan Cui, Zhihua Wei, Wen (cuichuan@tongji.edu.cn; zhihua wei@tongji.edu.cn; wenshen@tongji.edu.cn) School and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, of Computer Science China; Kejiang Chen, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu (chenkj@ustc.edu.cn; zhangwm@ustc.edu.cn; ynh@ustc.edu.cn) are with the Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Cyberspace Security Situation Awareness and Evaluation. are with Shen 1https://stability.ai/ 2https://www.midjourney.com/ 3https://blackforestlabs.ai/ Fig. 1. comparison on quality, correspondence, and authenticity aspects of AIGCIQA2023 [1] dataset illustrates the superior performance of our method. Unlike Natural Scene Image (NSI) quality assessment, which focuses primarily on perception aspects such as sharpness, color, and brightness, AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment (AGIQA) encompasses additional aspects like correspondence and authenticity. Since AGI is generated on the basis of user text prompts, it may fail to capture key user intentions, resulting in misalignment with the prompt. Furthermore, authenticity refers to how closely the generated image resembles real-world artworks, as AGI can sometimes exhibit logical inconsistencies. While traditional IQA models may effectively evaluate perceptual quality, they are often less capable of adequately assessing aspects such as correspondence and authenticity. Several methods have been proposed specifically for the AGIQA task, including metrics designed to evaluate the authenticity and diversity of generated images [2], [3]. Nevertheless, these methods tend to compare and evaluate grouped images rather than single instances, which limits their utility for single image assessment. Beginning with AGIQA-1k [4], series of AGIQA databases have been introduced, including AGIQA-3k [5], AIGCIQA-20k [6], etc. Concurrently, there has been surge in research utilizing deep learning methods [7][9], which have significantly benefited from pretrained models such as CLIP [10]. These approaches enhance the analysis by leveraging the correlations between images and their descriptive texts. While these models are effective in capturing general text-image alignments, they may not effectively detect subtle inconsistencies or mismatches between the generated image content and the detailed nuances of the 2 JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 textual description. Moreover, as these models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets for broad tasks, they might not fully exploit the textual information pertinent to the specific context task-specific fine-tuning. To overcome of AGIQA without these limitations, methods that leverage Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [11], [12] have been proposed. These methods aim to fully exploit the synergies of image captioning and textual analysis for AGIQA. Although they benefit from advanced prompt understanding, instruction following, and generation capabilities, they often do not utilize MLLMs as encoders capable of producing sequence of logits that integrate both image and text context. In conclusion, the field of AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment (AGIQA) continues to face significant challenges: (1) Developing comprehensive methods to assess AGIs from multiple dimensions, including quality, correspondence, and authenticity; (2) Enhancing assessment techniques to more accurately reflect human perception and the nuanced intentions embedded within prompts; (3) Optimizing the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to fully exploit their multimodal encoding capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose novel method M3-AGIQA (Multimodal, Multi-Round, Multi-Aspect AIGenerated Image Quality Assessment) which leverages MLLMs as both image and text encoders. This approach incorporates an additional network to align human perception and intentions, aiming to enhance assessment accuracy. Specially, we distill the rich image"

The Brownian sphere is a random metric space, homeomorphic to the two-dimensional sphere, which arises as the universal scaling limit of many types of random planar maps. The direct construction of the Brownian sphere is via a continuous analogue of the Cori--Vauquelin--Schaeffer (CVS) bijection. The CVS bijection maps labeled trees to planar maps, and the continuous version maps Aldous' continuum random tree with Brownian labels (the Brownian snake) to the Brownian sphere. In this work, we describe the inverse of the continuous CVS bijection, by constructing the Brownian snake as a measurable function of the Brownian sphere. Special care is needed to work with the orientation of the Brownian sphere.

The rapid advancement of AI-generated image (AGI) models has introduced significant challenges in evaluating their quality, which requires considering multiple dimensions such as perceptual quality, prompt correspondence, and authenticity. To address these challenges, we propose M3-AGIQA, a comprehensive framework for AGI quality assessment that is Multimodal, Multi-Round, and Multi-Aspect. Our approach leverages the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as joint text and image encoders and distills advanced captioning capabilities from online MLLMs into a local model via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning. The framework includes a structured multi-round evaluation mechanism, where intermediate image descriptions are generated to provide deeper insights into the quality, correspondence, and authenticity aspects. To align predictions with human perceptual judgments, a predictor constructed by an xLSTM and a regression head is incorporated to process sequential logits and predict Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs). Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that M3-AGIQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively capturing nuanced aspects of AGI quality. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation confirms its strong generalizability. The code is available at https://github.com/strawhatboy/M3-AGIQA.

Our primary goal here is to create a good, generalist perception model that can tackle multiple tasks, within limits on computational resources and training data. To achieve this, we resort to text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on billions of images. Our exhaustive evaluation metrics demonstrate that DICEPTION effectively tackles multiple perception tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art models. We achieve results on par with SAM-vit-h using only 0.06% of their data (e.g., 600K vs. 1B pixel-level annotated images). Inspired by Wang et al., DICEPTION formulates the outputs of various perception tasks using color encoding; and we show that the strategy of assigning random colors to different instances is highly effective in both entity segmentation and semantic segmentation. Unifying various perception tasks as conditional image generation enables us to fully leverage pre-trained text-to-image models. Thus, DICEPTION can be efficiently trained at a cost of orders of magnitude lower, compared to conventional models that were trained from scratch. When adapting our model to other tasks, it only requires fine-tuning on as few as 50 images and 1% of its parameters. DICEPTION provides valuable insights and a more promising solution for visual generalist models.
