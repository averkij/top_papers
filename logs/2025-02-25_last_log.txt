Text:"Reflective Planning: Vision-Language Models for Multi-Stage Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation Yunhai Feng 1 Jiaming Han 2 Zhuoran Yang 3 Xiangyu Yue 2 Sergey Levine 4 Jianlan Luo 4 5 2 0 2 3 2 ] . [ 1 7 0 7 6 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract Solving complex long-horizon robotic manipulation problems requires sophisticated high-level planning capabilities, the ability to reason about the physical world, and reactively choose appropriate motor skills. Vision-language models (VLMs) pretrained on Internet data could in principle offer framework for tackling such problems. However, in their current form, VLMs lack both the nuanced understanding of intricate physics required for robotic manipulation and the ability to reason over long horizons to address error compounding issues. In this paper, we introduce novel test-time computation framework that enhances VLMs physical reasoning capabilities for multi-stage manipulation tasks. At its core, our approach iteratively improves pretrained VLM with reflection mechanism - it uses generative model to imagine future world states, leverages these predictions to guide action selection, and critically reflects on potential suboptimalities to refine its reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms several stateof-the-art commercial VLMs as well as other post-training approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Videos are available at https://reflect-vlm.github.io. 1. Introduction Complex multi-stage manipulation tasks remain fundamental challenge in robotics (Luo et al., 2024a; Kroemer et al., 2020; Cui & Trinkle, 2021), particularly when they require reasoning about sophisticated physical interactions and their consequences over long time horizons. These tasks often involve intricate sequences of actions where each step Project Advisor 1Cornell University 2The Chinese University of Hong Kong 3Yale University 4University of California, Berkeley.

Schmidt Geoffrey I. Webb Monash University, Melbourne, Australia Universite Bretagne Sud, IRISA, Vannes, France Abstract We introduce Monsterthe MONash Scalable Time Series Evaluation Repositorya collection of large datasets for time series classification. The field of time series classification has benefitted from common benchmarks set by the UCR and UEA time series classification repositories. However, the datasets in these benchmarks are small, with median sizes of 217 and 255 examples, respectively. In consequence they favour narrow subspace of models that are optimised to achieve low classification error on wide variety of smaller datasets, that is, models that minimise variance, and give little weight to computational issues such as scalability. Our hope is to diversify the field by introducing benchmarks using larger datasets. We believe that there is enormous potential for new progress in the field by engaging with the theoretical and practical challenges of learning effectively from larger quantities of data. Keywords: time series classification, dataset, benchmark, bitter lesson State of the art in time series classification has become synonymous with state of the art on the datasets in the UCR and UEA archives (Bagnall et al., 2018; Dau et al., 2019; Bagnall et al., 2017; Middlehurst et al., 2024; Ruiz et al., 2021). However, most of these datasetsat least, most of those that are commonly used for evaluationare small: median training set size for the set of 142 canonical univariate time series datasets is just 217 examples. The preeminence of the datasets in the UCR and UEA archives as basis for benchmarking means that the field has become constrained by narrow focus on smaller datasets and models which achieve low 01 loss (classification error) on diversity of smal"

Solving complex long-horizon robotic manipulation problems requires sophisticated high-level planning capabilities, the ability to reason about the physical world, and reactively choose appropriate motor skills. Vision-language models (VLMs) pretrained on Internet data could in principle offer a framework for tackling such problems. However, in their current form, VLMs lack both the nuanced understanding of intricate physics required for robotic manipulation and the ability to reason over long horizons to address error compounding issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time computation framework that enhances VLMs' physical reasoning capabilities for multi-stage manipulation tasks. At its core, our approach iteratively improves a pretrained VLM with a "reflection" mechanism - it uses a generative model to imagine future world states, leverages these predictions to guide action selection, and critically reflects on potential suboptimalities to refine its reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art commercial VLMs as well as other post-training approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video generation and editing capabilities. However, multi-grained video editing, which encompasses class-level, instance-level, and part-level modifications, remains a formidable challenge. The major difficulties in multi-grained editing include semantic misalignment of text-to-region control and feature coupling within the diffusion model. To address these difficulties, we present VideoGrain, a zero-shot approach that modulates space-time (cross- and self-) attention mechanisms to achieve fine-grained control over video content. We enhance text-to-region control by amplifying each local prompt's attention to its corresponding spatial-disentangled region while minimizing interactions with irrelevant areas in cross-attention. Additionally, we improve feature separation by increasing intra-region awareness and reducing inter-region interference in self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world scenarios.

We introduce MONSTER-the MONash Scalable Time Series Evaluation Repository-a collection of large datasets for time series classification. The field of time series classification has benefitted from common benchmarks set by the UCR and UEA time series classification repositories. However, the datasets in these benchmarks are small, with median sizes of 217 and 255 examples, respectively. In consequence they favour a narrow subspace of models that are optimised to achieve low classification error on a wide variety of smaller datasets, that is, models that minimise variance, and give little weight to computational issues such as scalability. Our hope is to diversify the field by introducing benchmarks using larger datasets. We believe that there is enormous potential for new progress in the field by engaging with the theoretical and practical challenges of learning effectively from larger quantities of data.

We present X-Dancer, a novel zero-shot music-driven image animation pipeline that creates diverse and long-range lifelike human dance videos from a single static image. As its core, we introduce a unified transformer-diffusion framework, featuring an autoregressive transformer model that synthesize extended and music-synchronized token sequences for 2D body, head and hands poses, which then guide a diffusion model to produce coherent and realistic dance video frames. Unlike traditional methods that primarily generate human motion in 3D, X-Dancer addresses data limitations and enhances scalability by modeling a wide spectrum of 2D dance motions, capturing their nuanced alignment with musical beats through readily available monocular videos. To achieve this, we first build a spatially compositional token representation from 2D human pose labels associated with keypoint confidences, encoding both large articulated body movements (e.g., upper and lower body) and fine-grained motions (e.g., head and hands). We then design a music-to-motion transformer model that autoregressively generates music-aligned dance pose token sequences, incorporating global attention to both musical style and prior motion context. Finally we leverage a diffusion backbone to animate the reference image with these synthesized pose tokens through AdaIN, forming a fully differentiable end-to-end framework. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Dancer is able to produce both diverse and characterized dance videos, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods in term of diversity, expressiveness and realism. Code and model will be available for research purposes.
