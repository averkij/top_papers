[ 1 4 9 8 5 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r aRecent advancements in video generation have enabled models to synthesize high-quality, minutelong videos. However, generating even longer videos with temporal coherence remains major challenge and existing length extrapolation methods lead to temporal repetition or motion deceleration. In this work, we systematically analyze the role of frequency components in positional embeddings and identify an intrinsic frequency that primarily governs extrapolation behavior. Based on this insight, we propose RIFLEx, minimal yet effective approach that reduces the intrinsic frequency to suppress repetition while preserving motion consistency, without requiring any additional modifications. RIFLEx offers true free lunchachieving high-quality 2 extrapolation on state-of-the-art video diffusion transformers in completely training-free manner. Moreover, it enhances quality and enables 3 extrapolation by minimal fine-tuning without long videos. Project page and codes: https://riflex-video.github.io/. 1. Introduction Recent advances in video generation (Brooks et al., 2024; Bao et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Team, 2024b; Kong et al., 2024) enable models to synthesize minute-long video sequences with high fidelity and coherence. key factor behind this progress is the emergence of diffusion transformers (Peebles & Xie, 2023; Bao et al., 2023), which combines the scalability of diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021) with the expressive power of transformers (Vaswani, 2017). 1Dept. of Comp.

Correspondence to: Chongxuan Li <chongxuanli@ruc.edu.cn>, Jun Zhu <dcszj@tsinghua.edu.cn>. Preprint. Despite these advancements, generating longer videos with high-quality and temporal coherence remains fundamental challenge. Due to computational constraints and the sheer scale of training data, existing models are typically trained with fixed maximum sequence length, limiting their ability to extend content. Consequently, there is increasing interest in length extrapolation techniques that enable models to generate new and temporally coherent content that evolves smoothly over time without training on longer videos. However, existing extrapolation strategies (Chen et al., 2023b; bloc97, 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2024b; Zhuo et al., 2024), originally developed for text and image generation, fail when applied to video length extrapolation. Our experiments show that these methods exhibit distinct failure patterns: temporal repetition and slow motion. These limitations suggest fundamental gap in understanding how positional encodings influence video extrapolation. To address this, we isolate individual frequency components by zeroing out others and fine-tuning the target video model. We find that high frequencies capture short-term dependencies and induce temporal repetition, while low frequencies encode long-term dependencies but lead to motion deceleration. Surprisingly, we identify consistent intrinsic frequency component across different videos from the same model, which primarily dictates repetition patterns among all components during extrapolation. Building on this insight, we propose Reducing Intrinsic Frequency for Length Extrapolation (RIFLEx), minimal yet effective solution that lowers the intrinsic frequency to ensure it remains within single cycle after extrapolation. Without any other modification, it suppresses temporal repetition while preserving motion consistency. As byproduct, RIFLEx provides principled explanation for the failure modes of existing approaches and offers insights that naturally extend to spatial extrapolation of images. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art video diffusion transformers, including CogVideoX-5B (Yang et al., 2024) and HunyuanVideo (Kong et al., 2024), validate the effectiveness of RIFLEx (see Fig. 1). Remarkably, for 2 extrapolation, RIFLEx enables high-quality and natural video generation in completely training-free manner. When fine-tuning is applied with only 20,000 original-length RIFLEx: Free Lunch for Length Extrapolation in Video Diffusion Transformers (a) 2 temporal extrapolation from 129 to 261 frames.

Our base models are (a) HunyuanVideo (Kong et al., 2024) and (b-c) CogVideoX-5B (Yang et al., 2024), where we do not use any videos longer or larger than those used for pre-training. More demos and all the prompts used in this paper are listed in Appendix and the supplementary materials, respectively. videosrequiring just 1/50,000 of the pre-training computationsample quality is further improved, and the effectiveness of RIFLEx extends to 3 extrapolation. Moreover, RIFLEx can also be applied in the spatial domain simultaneously to extend both video duration and spatial resolution. Our key contributions are summarized as follows: We provide comprehensive understanding of video length extrapolation by analyzing the failure modes of existing methods and revealing the role of individual frequency components in positional embeddings. We propose RIFLEx, minimal yet effective solution that mitigates repetition by properly reducing the intrinsic frequency, without any additional modifications. RIFLEx offers true free lunchachieving highquality 2 extrapolation on state-of-the-art video diffusion transformers in completely training-free manner. Moreover, it enhances quality and enables 3 extrapolation by minimal fine-tuning without long videos. 2. Background 2.1.

Recent advancements in audio tokenization have significantly enhanced the integration of audio capabilities into large language models (LLMs). However, audio understanding and generation are often treated as distinct tasks, hindering the development of truly unified audio-language models. While instruction tuning has demonstrated remarkable success in improving generalization and zero-shot learning across text and vision, its application to audio remains largely unexplored. A major obstacle is the lack of comprehensive datasets that unify audio understanding and generation. To address this, we introduce Audio-FLAN, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset covering 80 diverse tasks across speech, music, and sound domains, with over 100 million instances. Audio-FLAN lays the foundation for unified audio-language models that can seamlessly handle both understanding (e.g., transcription, comprehension) and generation (e.g., speech, music, sound) tasks across a wide range of audio domains in a zero-shot manner. The Audio-FLAN dataset is available on HuggingFace and GitHub and will be continuously updated.

Scaling pre-training compute has proven effective for achieving mulitlinguality, but does the same hold for test-time scaling? In this work, we introduce MCLM, a multilingual math benchmark featuring competition-level problems in 55 languages. We test three test-time scaling methods-Outcome Reward Modeling (ORM), Process Reward Modeling (ORM), and Budget Forcing (BF)-on both Qwen2.5-1.5B Math and MR1-1.5B, a multilingual LLM we trained for extended reasoning. Our experiments show that using Qwen2.5-1.5B Math with ORM achieves a score of 35.8 on MCLM, while BF on MR1-1.5B attains 35.2. Although "thinking LLMs" have recently garnered significant attention, we find that their performance is comparable to traditional scaling methods like best-of-N once constrained to similar levels of inference FLOPs. Moreover, while BF yields a 20-point improvement on English AIME, it provides only a 1.94-point average gain across other languages-a pattern consistent across the other test-time scaling methods we studied-higlighting that test-time scaling may not generalize as effectively to multilingual tasks. To foster further research, we release MCLM, MR1-1.5B, and evaluation results.

We introduce Slam, a recipe for training high-quality Speech Language Models (SLMs) on a single academic GPU in 24 hours. We do so through empirical analysis of model initialisation and architecture, synthetic training data, preference optimisation with synthetic data and tweaking all other components. We empirically demonstrate that this training recipe also scales well with more compute getting results on par with leading SLMs in a fraction of the compute cost. We hope these insights will make SLM training and research more accessible. In the context of SLM scaling laws, our results far outperform predicted compute optimal performance, giving an optimistic view to SLM feasibility.

Recent advancements in video generation have enabled models to synthesize high-quality, minute-long videos. However, generating even longer videos with temporal coherence remains a major challenge, and existing length extrapolation methods lead to temporal repetition or motion deceleration. In this work, we systematically analyze the role of frequency components in positional embeddings and identify an intrinsic frequency that primarily governs extrapolation behavior. Based on this insight, we propose RIFLEx, a minimal yet effective approach that reduces the intrinsic frequency to suppress repetition while preserving motion consistency, without requiring any additional modifications. RIFLEx offers a true free lunch--achieving high-quality 2times extrapolation on state-of-the-art video diffusion transformers in a completely training-free manner. Moreover, it enhances quality and enables 3times extrapolation by minimal fine-tuning without long videos. Project page and codes: https://riflex-video.github.io/{https://riflex-video.github.io/.}

As the open-weight AI landscape continues to proliferate-with model development, significant investment, and user interest-it becomes increasingly important to predict which models will ultimately drive innovation and shape AI ecosystems. Building on parallels with citation dynamics in scientific literature, we propose a framework to quantify how an open-weight model's influence evolves. Specifically, we adapt the model introduced by Wang et al. for scientific citations, using three key parameters-immediacy, longevity, and relative fitness-to track the cumulative number of fine-tuned models of an open-weight model. Our findings reveal that this citation-style approach can effectively capture the diverse trajectories of open-weight model adoption, with most models fitting well and outliers indicating unique patterns or abrupt jumps in usage.
