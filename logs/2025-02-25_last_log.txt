[ 1 5 5 0 7 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r aThis paper comprehensively evaluates several recently proposed optimizers for 4-bit training, revealing that low-bit precision amplifies sensitivity to learning rates and often causes unstable gradient norms, leading to divergence at higher learning rates. Among these, SPAM, recent optimizer featuring momentum reset and spikeaware gradient clipping, achieves the best performance across various bit levels, but struggles to stabilize gradient norms, requiring careful learning rate tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Stable-SPAM, which incorporates enhanced gradient normalization and clipping techniques. In particular, Stable-SPAM (1) adaptively updates the clipping threshold for spiked gradients by tracking their historical maxima; (2) normalizes the entire gradient matrix based on its historical l2-norm statistics; and (3) inherits momentum reset from SPAM to periodically reset the first and second moments of Adam, mitigating the accumulation of spiked gradients. Extensive experiments show that Stable-SPAM effectively stabilizes gradient norms in 4-bit LLM training, delivering superior performance compared to Adam and SPAM. Notably, our 4-bit LLaMA-1B model trained with Stable-SPAM outperforms the BF16 LLaMA1B trained with Adam by up to 2 perplexity. Furthermore, when both models are trained in 4-bit, Stable-SPAM achieves the same loss as Adam while requiring only about half the training steps. *Equal contribution 1Department of Computer Science, University of Exeter 2Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Eindhoven University of Technology 3School of the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China 4Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin 5Department of Computer Science, University of Reading 6School of Cyber Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University 7Department of Computer Science, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 8Squirrel Ai Learning 9Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford.

Introduction Recently, several advanced optimizers have been proposed, claiming to either outperform the widely used Adam optimizer or achieve comparable performance at reduced costs in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). Given the massive size of LLMs, reducing the memory footprint of Adam has become key objective in this line of research (Shazeer & Stern, 2018; Chen et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a; Zhao et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2024b; Ma et al., 2024). Another area of focus is addressing the challenges of instability in LLM training. For instance, Huang et al. (2025) proposed SPAM which incorporates momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clip (SpikeClip) to mitigate the adverse effects of loss spikes. Zhao et al. (2024b) studied the stability of various optimizers to hyperparameters with BF16. These optimizers are predominantly evaluated using the standard BF16 precision, which is practical option for real-world LLM training (Touvron et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). With the growing shift toward low-bit precisions such as FP8 and FP4 in LLMs due to their significant costsaving potential (Liu et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024; Peng et al., 2023; Xi et al., 2023), it is crucial to investigate whether their effectiveness persists under lower-bit precisions. For the newly proposed optimizers to be economical, their training with low-bit precisions should be similarly robust to hyperparameter choice as trained using higher precision. This paper provides comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness and robustness of learning rate choices across various recent optimizers, including Adam (Kingma, 2014), Adafactor (Shazeer & Stern, 2018), Adam-mini (Zhang et al., 2024a), and SPAM (Huang et al., 2025), when training with 4-bit weights and activations. Our study reveals several key observations: All evaluated optimizers exhibit increased sensitivity to learning rate choices during 4-bit training, often diverging quickly when larger learning rates are used as shown in Figure 2. SPAM consistently achieves the lowest evaluation loss 1 Stable-SPAM: How to Train in 4-Bit More Stably than 16-Bit Adam Figure 1. Performance of 4-bit LLM training. Experiments are conducted with LLaMA-130M/350M/1B models on C4 Dataset. Adam-BF16 denotes that the model is trained with BF16 by Adam. Perplexity on validation set is reported. across various bit levels but requires careful learning rate tuning. Adafactor is surprisingly robust to learning rate choices, even outperforming Adam in this regard. both models are trained in 4-bit, Stable-SPAM achieves the same loss as Adam while requiring only about half the training steps. Our analysis of the training dynamics in Figure 4 reveals that 4-bit training often exhibits extremely unstable gradient norms, often accompanied by spikes, compared to BF16. This behavior can result in loss spikes and, in some cases, even training divergence with relatively larger learning rates. While SpikeClip introduced in SPAM mitigates the unstable gradient norms caused by 4-bit training to certain extent, it falls short of fully preventing training divergence, as shown in Figure 3. Despite its sensitivity to learning rate selection, SPAM consistently achieves the lowest evaluation loss across various bit levels, making it an ideal foundation for improvement. Building on this, we introduce Stable-SPAM to address the instability challenges associated with low-precision training of LLMs. Stable-SPAM retains the superior performance of SPAM1 while improving stability, offering significant advancement in low-precision optimization. Specifically, beyond the original momentum reset operation in SPAM, Stable-SPAM introduces two key techniques: Adaptive Spike-Aware Clipping (AdaClip), which enables adaptive clipping of spiked gradients, followed by Adaptive Gradient Norm (AdaGN), which normalizes the entire gradient matrix based on its historical l2 norm statistics. Our analysis demonstrates that these enhancements effectively stabilize the gradient norm of 4-bit training, achieving better performance than Adam an"

Text:"TAG: Decentralized Framework for Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Giuseppe Paolo 1 Abdelhakim Benechehab 1 Hamza Cherkaoui 1 Albert Thomas 1 Balázs Kégl 1 5 2 0 2 4 2 ] . [ 2 5 2 4 5 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r aHierarchical organization is fundamental to biological systems and human societies, yet artificial intelligence systems often rely on monolithic architectures that limit adaptability and scalability. Current hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approaches typically restrict hierarchies to two levels or require centralized training, which limits their practical applicability. We introduce TAME Agent Framework (TAG), framework for constructing fully decentralized hierarchical multi-agent systems. TAG enables hierarchies of arbitrary depth through novel LevelEnv concept, which abstracts each hierarchy level as the environment for the agents above it. This approach standardizes information flow between levels while preserving loose coupling, allowing for seamless integration of diverse agent types. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG by implementing hierarchical architectures that combine different RL agents across multiple levels, achieving improved performance over classical multiagent RL baselines on standard benchmarks. Our results show that decentralized hierarchical organization enhances both learning speed and final performance, positioning TAG as promising direction for scalable multi-agent systems. 1. Introduction Human societies are organized as hierarchical networks of agents, ranging from organizational structures (junior employees middle managers CEO) to ontological relationships (individuals families nations). This hierarchical organization facilitates complex coordination by decomposing problems across multiple scales while ensuring robustness through localized failure handling. As *Equal contribution nologies France. <giuseppe.g.paolo@gmail.com>. 1Noahs Ark Lab, Huawei TechCorrespondence to: Giuseppe Paolo TAG codebase available at: https://github.com/ GPaolo/TAG_Framework 1 Figure 1: Threeand two-level hierarchical agents used in the four-agent MPE-Spread environment. Yellow boxes represent the hierarchy levels, while blue connections indicate what each agent perceives as its environment. Red connections illustrate how the agents in the real environment are controlled, and green boxes represent the goals that the agents must reach. proposed in the TAME approach (Levin, 2022), biological systems also function as hierarchical networks of agents, where higher-level agents coordinate lower-level ones. Each level exhibits varying degrees of cognitive sophistication, corresponding to the scale of the goals it can pursue. From single cells managing basic homeostasis to tissues coordinating morphogenesis to brains overseeing complex behaviors, each level builds upon and integrates the intelligence of its components to achieve increasingly sophisticated cognitive capabilities. However, implementing similar hierarchical structures in artificial systems presents several key challenges: (1) coordinating information flow between levels without centralized control, (2) enabling efficient learning despite the non-stationarity introduced by the simultaneous adaptation of agents at multiple levels, and (3) maintaining scalability as the depth of the hierarchy increases. Formally, we consider the challenge of learning in multiagent systems where agents must collaborate to solve complex tasks, each maximizing their own expected returns. In this setting, each agent receives its own reward. As inTAG: TAME Agent Framework creases, the joint action and state spaces grow exponentially, rendering centralized approaches intractable. Moreover, agents must learn to coordinate across different temporal and spatial scales, ranging from immediate reactive behaviors to long-term strategic planning. Current AI systems predominantly rely on monolithic architectures that limit their adaptability and scalability in addressing these challenges. This is evident in large language models (LLMs) and traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches where agents are typically defined as single, end-to-end trainable instances. Such monolithic designs present several limitations: they require complete retraining when conditions change, lack the natural compositionality of hierarchical systems, and scale poorly with increasing task complexity. Traditional multi-agent approaches based on centralized training with decentralized execution or twolevel hierarchies with manager/worker structures struggle in such situations due to the high dimensionality of the states, limiting their applicability to small number of agents. At the same time, strategies consisting of independent learners with communication protocols are less afflicted by this, but suffer from possible communication overhead. Our key insight is that biological systems address similar coordination challenges through flexible, multi-scale hierarchical organization. We propose that future intelligent systems should be structured more like societies of agents than as monolithic entities. Our long-term goal is to build agents that resemble hierarchical and dynamic networks of sub-agents, rather than static structures. In this work, we take the first step in that direction with the introduction of the TAME Agent Framework (TAG), which draws inspiration from TAMEs biological insights (Levin, 2022) to create hierarchical multi-agent RL framework that enables the construction of arbitrarily deep agent hierarchies. The core innovation of TAG is the LevelEnv abstraction, which facilitates the construction of multi-level multi-agent systems. Through this abstraction, each agent in the hierarchy interacts with the level below as if it were its environmentobserving it through state representations, influencing it through actions, and receiving rewards based on the lower levels performance. The resulting system consists of multiple horizontal levels, as shown in Fig. 1, each containing one or more sub-agents, loosely connected to both their upper-level counterparts and their lower-level components. This structure reduces communication overhead and state space size by connecting agents locally within the hierarchy. TAG introduces several key innovations: 1. LevelEnv abstraction that standardizes information flow between levels while preserving agent autonomy, by presenting each level of the hierarchy as the environment to the level above; 2. flex"

This paper comprehensively evaluates several recently proposed optimizers for 4-bit training, revealing that low-bit precision amplifies sensitivity to learning rates and often causes unstable gradient norms, leading to divergence at higher learning rates. Among these, SPAM, a recent optimizer featuring momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping, achieves the best performance across various bit levels, but struggles to stabilize gradient norms, requiring careful learning rate tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Stable-SPAM, which incorporates enhanced gradient normalization and clipping techniques. In particular, Stable-SPAM (1) adaptively updates the clipping threshold for spiked gradients by tracking their historical maxima; (2) normalizes the entire gradient matrix based on its historical l_2-norm statistics; and (3) inherits momentum reset from SPAM to periodically reset the first and second moments of Adam, mitigating the accumulation of spiked gradients. Extensive experiments show that Stable-SPAM effectively stabilizes gradient norms in 4-bit LLM training, delivering superior performance compared to Adam and SPAM. Notably, our 4-bit LLaMA-1B model trained with Stable-SPAM outperforms the BF16 LLaMA-1B trained with Adam by up to 2 perplexity. Furthermore, when both models are trained in 4-bit, Stable-SPAM achieves the same loss as Adam while requiring only about half the training steps.

Hierarchical organization is fundamental to biological systems and human societies, yet artificial intelligence systems often rely on monolithic architectures that limit adaptability and scalability. Current hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approaches typically restrict hierarchies to two levels or require centralized training, which limits their practical applicability. We introduce TAME Agent Framework (TAG), a framework for constructing fully decentralized hierarchical multi-agent systems.TAG enables hierarchies of arbitrary depth through a novel LevelEnv concept, which abstracts each hierarchy level as the environment for the agents above it. This approach standardizes information flow between levels while preserving loose coupling, allowing for seamless integration of diverse agent types. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG by implementing hierarchical architectures that combine different RL agents across multiple levels, achieving improved performance over classical multi-agent RL baselines on standard benchmarks. Our results show that decentralized hierarchical organization enhances both learning speed and final performance, positioning TAG as a promising direction for scalable multi-agent systems.
