Text:"5 2 0 2 4 2 ] . [ 1 0 1 8 6 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r Grounded Persuasive Language Generation for Automated Marketing Jibang Wu Chenghao Yang Simon Mahns Chaoqi Wang Hao Zhu Fei Fang Haifeng XuThis paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of persuasive and grounded marketing content, using real estate listing descriptions as our focal application domain. Our method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while highlighting useful factual attributes. This agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module, mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized features. We conduct systematic human-subject experiments in the domain of real estate marketing, with focus group of potential house buyers. The results demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are preferred over those written by human experts by clear margin. Our findings suggest promising LLM-based agentic framework to automate large-scale targeted marketing while ensuring responsible generation using only facts.While large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across various tasks, their ability to persuade remains an underexplored frontier (see discussion of related work in Section 6). This however is particularly important capability since persuasion-related economic activities common thread in almost all voluntary transactions from advertising and lobbying to litigation and negotiation underpin roughly 30% of the US GDP (Antioch, 2013; McCloskey and Klamer, 1995), hence gives rise to tremendous opportunity for applying LLMs across wide range of sectors. Meanwhile, this same potential introduces serious trustworthiness concerns. If LLMs can generate persuasive content at scale, their influence on human opinions raises risks of misinformation, manipulation and misuse, especially in sensitive domains such as political campaigns (Voelkel et al., 2023; Goldstein et al., 2024). In addition to these profound economic and societal applications, the relationship between the nature of intelligence and persuasion has been fundamental research question since the time of early Greek philosophy. Aristotle viewed persuasion as both an art and an expression of intelligence, rooted in the ability to reason and communicate effectively. Yet, the Greeks also cautioned against the sophistry that overly relies on rhetorical and emotional techniques divorced from the truth. This tension becomes especially relevant today with the rise of generative AI. Notable figures, such as This work is supported by the AI2050 program at Schmidt Sciences (Grant G-24-66104) and NSF Award CCF-2303372. The first two authors contribute equally. University of Chicago, corresponding email: {wujibang,chenghao}@uchicago.edu Stanford University Carnegie Mellon University Preprint. Under review. Sam Altman, have predicted that AI systems could achieve superhuman persuasion without superhuman general intelligence (Altman, 2023). This dichotomy raises several crucial questions for LLM research: How can we reliably and consistently measure fact-based persuasiveness? Does greater intelligence inherently lead to stronger persuasive capabilities? And if not, what specific abilities must LLMs develop to truly master persuasion? Surprisingly little is known about these questions, and this is what we embark on in this paper. The faculty of observing, in any given case, the available means of persuasion. Aristotle, Rhetoric. In this paper, we study language generation for grounded persuasion particular form of persuasion, inspired by Aristotles philosophy, that is grounded in fact, tailored to the audience, and adapted to contextual factors. Grounded persuasion is crucial for applications in marketing and advertising, and its effectiveness can be linked directly to measurable behavioral changes (e.g., in terms of engagement and conversions) while constrained by factual accuracy. We choose real estate marketing as our testbed for grounded persuasion and construct realistic evaluation environment to include the process of preference elicitation and measure the persuasiveness of preference-based generation. To enable grounded persuasion in this context, we design an LLM-based agent with three key modules: Grounding Module, which mimics human expertise in signaling critical and credible selling points; Personalization Module, which tailors content to user preferences; and Marketing Module, which ensures factual accuracy and integrates localized features. We use this model-based approach to back up LLMs generation and are able to achieve superhuman persuasion in real estate marketing. Our findings lay the groundwork for leveraging LLMs in large-scale, targeted marketing and beyond, offering scalable solution to complex persuasion tasks in real-world applications. Our Contribution Our primary research objective is to demonstrate path towards effective design of persuasive language agents with backbone of more principled theory. Towards this end, we choose to focus on an application of automated marketing, where we employ the economic theory of strategic communication games to guide the agentic process ranging from processing products (factual) raw attributes, to selecting features to highlight, and ultimately to generate human-like marketing texts. We start from developing micro-economic framework for automated marketing, and then operationalize this framework by leveraging the capabilities of LLMs. In addition, we set up realistic evaluation process of the persuasiveness capability. This includes building large real estate dataset from Zillow, designing dedicated survey website to mimic the house search process and test with focused group of potential home buyers. Our experiments suggest marketing descriptions generated by our methods have clear winning edge of 70% over those written by expert human realtors.Motivations and Challenges The first task of our study is to build consistent and effective evaluation benchmark. However, this effort faces several key challenges. fundamental challenge is the inherent subjectivity of persuasion, which depends heavily on human feedback. Unlike many other LLM capabilities, such as reasoning and planning, which have objective criteria for evaluation, persuasiveness"

Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable improvements in reasoning and many existing benchmarks have been addressed by models such as o1 and o3 either fully or partially. However, a majority of these benchmarks emphasize deductive reasoning, including mathematical and coding tasks in which rules such as mathematical axioms or programming syntax are clearly defined, based on which LLMs can plan and apply these rules to arrive at a solution. In contrast, inductive reasoning, where one infers the underlying rules from observed data, remains less explored. Such inductive processes lie at the heart of scientific discovery, as they enable researchers to extract general principles from empirical observations. To assess whether LLMs possess this capacity, we introduce InductionBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs. Our experimental findings reveal that even the most advanced models available struggle to master the simplest complexity classes within the subregular hierarchy of functions, highlighting a notable deficiency in current LLMs' inductive reasoning capabilities.

This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of persuasive and grounded marketing content, using real estate listing descriptions as our focal application domain. Our method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while highlighting useful factual attributes. This agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module, mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized features. We conduct systematic human-subject experiments in the domain of real estate marketing, with a focus group of potential house buyers. The results demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are preferred over those written by human experts by a clear margin. Our findings suggest a promising LLM-based agentic framework to automate large-scale targeted marketing while ensuring responsible generation using only facts.

Quality estimation is omnipresent in machine translation, for both evaluation and generation. Unfortunately, quality estimation models are often opaque and computationally expensive, making them impractical to be part of large-scale pipelines. In this work, we tackle two connected challenges: (1) reducing the cost of quality estimation at scale, and (2) developing an inexpensive uncertainty estimation method for quality estimation. To address the latter, we introduce Instant Confidence COMET, an uncertainty-aware quality estimation model that matches the performance of previous approaches at a fraction of their costs. We extend this to Early-Exit COMET, a quality estimation model that can compute quality scores and associated confidences already at early model layers, allowing us to early-exit computations and reduce evaluation costs. We also apply our model to machine translation reranking. We combine Early-Exit COMET with an upper confidence bound bandit algorithm to find the best candidate from a large pool without having to run the full evaluation model on all candidates. In both cases (evaluation and reranking) our methods reduce the required compute by 50% with very little degradation in performance.

Answering complex, long-context questions remains a major challenge for large language models (LLMs) as it requires effective question clarifications and context retrieval. We propose Agentic Long-Context Understanding (AgenticLU), a framework designed to enhance an LLM's understanding of such queries by integrating targeted self-clarification with contextual grounding within an agentic workflow. At the core of AgenticLU is Chain-of-Clarifications (CoC), where models refine their understanding through self-generated clarification questions and corresponding contextual groundings. By scaling inference as a tree search where each node represents a CoC step, we achieve 97.8% answer recall on NarrativeQA with a search depth of up to three and a branching factor of eight. To amortize the high cost of this search process to training, we leverage the preference pairs for each step obtained by the CoC workflow and perform two-stage model finetuning: (1) supervised finetuning to learn effective decomposition strategies, and (2) direct preference optimization to enhance reasoning quality. This enables AgenticLU models to generate clarifications and retrieve relevant context effectively and efficiently in a single inference pass. Extensive experiments across seven long-context tasks demonstrate that AgenticLU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompting methods and specialized long-context LLMs, achieving robust multi-hop reasoning while sustaining consistent performance as context length grows.

The COVID-19 pandemic strained healthcare resources and prompted discussion about how machine learning can alleviate physician burdens and contribute to diagnosis. Chest x-rays (CXRs) are used for diagnosis of COVID-19, but few studies predict the severity of a patient's condition from CXRs. In this study, we produce a large COVID severity dataset by merging three sources and investigate the efficacy of transfer learning using ImageNet- and CXR-pretrained models and vision transformers (ViTs) in both severity regression and classification tasks. A pretrained DenseNet161 model performed the best on the three class severity prediction problem, reaching 80% accuracy overall and 77.3%, 83.9%, and 70% on mild, moderate and severe cases, respectively. The ViT had the best regression results, with a mean absolute error of 0.5676 compared to radiologist-predicted severity scores. The project's source code is publicly available.
