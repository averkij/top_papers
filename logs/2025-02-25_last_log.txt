Text:"Can Community Notes Replace Professional Fact-Checkers?nb@di.ku.dk grwa@di.ku.dk augenstein@di.ku.dk 5 2 0 2 9 1 ] . [ 1 2 3 1 4 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r de@di.ku.dkTwo commonly-employed strategies to combat the rise of misinformation on social media are (i) fact-checking by professional organisations and (ii) community moderation by platform users. Policy changes by Twitter/X and, more recently, Meta, signal shift away from partnerships with fact-checking organisations and towards an increased reliance on crowdsourced community notes. However, the extent and nature of dependencies between fact-checking and helpful community notes remain unclear. To address these questions, we use language models to annotate large corpus of Twitter/X community notes with attributes such as topic, cited sources, and whether they refute claims tied to broader misinformation narratives. Our analysis reveals that community notes cite factchecking sources up to five times more than previously reported. Fact-checking is especially crucial for notes on posts linked to broader narratives, which are twice as likely to reference fact-checking sources compared to other sources. In conclusion, our results show that successful community moderation heavily relies on professional fact-checking.The proliferation of misinformation on social media (Arnold, 2020; Diakopoulos, 2020), along with the rise of generative AI (Augenstein et al., 2024) have led to increasing concerns about its current and future potential harms, (e.g., to health (Clemente et al., 2022)) and threats to democracy and political stability (Reglitz, 2022). Fact-checkers play crucial role in combatting misinformation (Graves, 2017), and in recent years, have partnered with social media platforms, e.g., Meta, YouTube, and TikTok, to tackle its spread on these platforms. However, due to the scale of misleading content shared online, community moderation (e.g., options to flag potential misinformation, group/server moderators) is often employed Figure 1: An example of community note. Notice the fact-checking link and rating. in parallel (Morrow et al., 2022), as complementary approach (e.g., (Google, 2025); see also the practice of snoping (Pilarski et al., 2024)). The expansion of fact-checking projects in the last decade (Lauer and Graves, 2024), alongside their broader initiatives to curb misinformation (e.g., citizen media literacy programmes (Juneja and Mitra, 2022)) have been aided by partnerships with social media platforms such as Meta and Google (Graves and Anderson, 2020), which fund independent fact-checking agencies to fact-check potentially false claims on their platform.1 However, political pressure and accusations of bias and censorship, and most recently, Metas announcement of its plans to end its partnerships with fact-checkers in the U.S. and implement community moderation model (Meta, 2025), threatens the financial stability of fact-checking organisations, and hence, their ability to keep up with the increasing volume and sophistication of misinformation spread (Stencel et al., 2024; IFCN, 2024). Metas recent policy shift also implies that these two strategies (fact-checking and community notes) are independent and in opposition, rather than two 1Fact-checkers provide judgment of claim veracity and exert no influence on the platforms content moderation policies (Catalanello and Sanders, 2025). complementary strategies of tackling online misinformation. In this paper, we examine Twitter/X community notes as case study to understand how fact-checking is used in community notes. Specifically, we investigate the following two questions: (RQ1) To what extent do community notes rely on the work of professional fact-checkers? and (RQ2) What are the traits of posts and notes that rely on fact-checking sources? Studying the relationship between fact-checking and community notes is vital for understanding the shared role of expert and community-driven fact-checking in the global information ecosystem. We find that at least 1 in 20 community notes rely explicitly on the work of professional fact-checkers, while this reliance is higher still for high-stakes topics such as health and politics. Our experiments also show that fact-checking is vital for debunking misleading content linked to broader narratives or conspiracy theories. These findings imply that high-quality community notes cannot be produced independently of professional fact-checking. They further suggest that the pressure on fact-checkers exerted by platforms and politicians by defunding and discrediting fact-checking organisations will have corrosive effects on the quality of notes and destructive implications for information integrity more widely.Community moderation has been proposed as means of addressing the scalability (Martel et al., 2024) and cross-partisanship trust (Flamini, 2019) challenges associated with fact-checking. Twitter/Xs Community Notes programme (piloted in 2021 and publicly launched in October 2022 (Twitter/X, 2021)) is notable example of such system. Any platform user may volunteer as Community Notes contributor, although they must achieve particular rating impact score before they can write notes (Twitter/X, 2024b). Notes that achieve helpful rating appear underneath the post, explaining why the post is misleading (see Fig. 1). To be rated helpful, note must receive similar levels of helpfulness rating from users with diverse viewpoints (Twitter/X, 2024a)."

Two commonly-employed strategies to combat the rise of misinformation on social media are (i) fact-checking by professional organisations and (ii) community moderation by platform users. Policy changes by Twitter/X and, more recently, Meta, signal a shift away from partnerships with fact-checking organisations and towards an increased reliance on crowdsourced community notes. However, the extent and nature of dependencies between fact-checking and helpful community notes remain unclear. To address these questions, we use language models to annotate a large corpus of Twitter/X community notes with attributes such as topic, cited sources, and whether they refute claims tied to broader misinformation narratives. Our analysis reveals that community notes cite fact-checking sources up to five times more than previously reported. Fact-checking is especially crucial for notes on posts linked to broader narratives, which are twice as likely to reference fact-checking sources compared to other sources. In conclusion, our results show that successful community moderation heavily relies on professional fact-checking.

Особенно важен фактчекинг для заметок о постах, связанных с более широкими дезинформационными нарративами.
