Text:"We Cant Understand AI Using our Existing Vocabulary John Hewitt 1 Robert Geirhos 1 Been Kim 1 5 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 6 8 5 7 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aThis position paper argues that, in order to understand AI, we cannot rely on our existing vocabulary of human words. Instead, we should strive to develop neologisms: new words that represent precise human concepts that we want to teach machines, or machine concepts that we need to learn. We start from the premise that humans and machines have differing concepts. This means interpretability can be framed as communication problem: humans must be able to reference and control machine concepts, and communicate human concepts to machines. Creating shared human-machine language through developing neologisms, we believe, could solve this communication problem. Successful neologisms achieve useful amount of abstraction: not too detailed, so theyre reusable in many contexts, and not too high-level, so they convey precise information. As proof of concept, we demonstrate how length neologism enables controlling LLM response length, while diversity neologism allows sampling more variable responses. Taken together, we argue that we cannot understand AI using our existing vocabulary, and expanding it through neologisms creates opportunities for both controlling and understanding machines better. 1. Introduction Die Grenzen meiner Sprache bedeuten die Grenzen meiner Welt (The limits of my language are the limits of my world) Ludwig Wittgenstein As researchers interested in understanding and controlling language model-based AI systems, we often search for human-like concepts in machinese.g., by analyzing machines activation patterns. Examples of such concepts include human-like linguistic structure (e.g. Lakretz et al., 2019; Hewitt & Manning, 2019), or notions of safety or truth (Burns et al., 2023). Often, the goal of this search is to help 1Google DeepMind. Correspondence to: John Hewitt <johnhew@google.com>, Been Kim <beenkim@google.com>. Under Review. 1 Figure 1. Humans and machines conceptualize the world differently from each other. Mismatches in communication occur, which lead to misunderstandings. To understand and control AI, we must bridge this gap by developing new words corresponding to human and machine concepts, and use these words to control machines. specify human concepts to machinesthat is, to control them, e.g., through supervised probes, or prompts, or RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022). Taken together, understanding and control are communication problem: communicating concepts between humans and machines. Within this communication problem, understanding and control are often two sides of the same coin: the purpose of communicating with machines is typically to make machines do what we want them to do (control), while achieving better understanding should directly translate into better communication. This communication problem is hard becauseand we take this as premisehumans and machines conceptualize the world differently, at many levels of abstraction (as expressed by Figure 1). machines notion of sentiment is different from human notion of sentiment. Likewise for high-quality code, or topic. In Kim (2022) for example, reproduced in Figure 2, there is space of machine concepts and space of human concepts, and many things are either in : concepts humans have but machines do not, or H: concepts machines have but humans do not. In fact; even for things seemingly in , we expect that careful inspection would show that the seemingly similar concepts actually differ between humans and machines. Our position is in this communication problemthus, progress in interpretabilityis best achieved by striving to define new words (neologisms) that that progress We Cant Understand AI Using Our Existing Vocabulary Figure 2. Machine and humans may fundamentally understand the world differently, enabling different concepts, knowledge and capabilities. Figure reproduced from Kim (2022); Schut et al. (2023) with permission. mean human concept (when interpreted by machine) or machine concept (when interpreted by human). What does introducing neologisms offer? The perspective provides clarity in what level of abstraction to attempt to bridge this communication gap. Successful words in language strike useful levels of abstraction: theyre not too exacting and low-level, like word for the exact placement of the chairs at my table in relation to me. Such words would be too rarely used to be successful. This is alike to attempting for full, exact, mechanistic understanding of neural network: words corresponding to such exactness must necessarily not apply commonly, because the world (and networks modeling the world) are too complex to be concisely described at that level. At the same time, most successful words are not too high-level (only few such words, like thing, exist)theyre discriminative enough of communicative intent to be informative in conversation. Erring too high-level is alike to only doing behavioral testing of network; the level of abstraction is that of an inputoutput map (e.g., logit output). Such evaluation is useful, but it gives us insufficient richness to specify our goals and understand future behavior. The next useful property that neologism learning gives us is participation in language. Language is how we understand other humans, and we define new words when our differences in conceptualization lead to the need to concisely communicate new concepts. Likewise, defining new words in our communication problem with machines, we can plug these words into existing language and leverage the expressive compositional structure thereof. Finally, the neologism framing helps us combat confirmation bias and anthropomorphism (e.g. Buckner, 2019). As human researchers, we have bias towards seeing humanlike things in artificial networks; we want to see high-level human concepts appearing in networks. We want to see exciting unsupervised structure. Even something as simple as sentiment neuron (OpenAI, 2017), if given its own new word, reminds us that this sentiment-like concept of the machine is likely dissimilar from what we call sentiment in ways that another humans notion of sentiment might not be. In Section 3.1, we argue that this dissimilarity will only increase as machines become more capable. Our notion of what constitutes defining new words is intentionally broadthis is high-level research direction wherein details must be nailed down over time. In our f"

Buehler1,3,4* 1 Laboratory for Atomistic and Molecular Mechanics (LAMM), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA 2 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA 3 Center for Computational Science and Engineering, Schwarzman College of Computing, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA 4Lead contact *Correspondence: mbuehler@MIT.EDU Abstract: Proteins are dynamic molecular machines whose biological functions, spanning enzymatic catalysis, signal transduction, and structural adaptation, are intrinsically linked to their motions. Designing proteins with targeted dynamic properties, however, remains challenge due to the complex, degenerate relationships between sequence, structure, and molecular motion. Here, we introduce VibeGen, generative AI framework that enables end-to-end de novo protein design conditioned on normal mode vibrations. VibeGen employs an agentic dualmodel architecture, comprising protein designer that generates sequence candidates based on specified vibrational modes and protein predictor that evaluates their dynamic accuracy. This approach synergizes diversity, accuracy, and novelty during the design process. Via full-atom molecular simulations as direct validation, we demonstrate that the designed proteins accurately reproduce the prescribed normal mode amplitudes across the backbone while adopting various stable, functionally relevant structures. Notably, generated sequences are de novo, exhibiting no significant similarity to natural proteins, thereby expanding the accessible protein space beyond evolutionary constraints. Our work integrates protein dynamics into generative protein design, and establishes direct, bidirectional link between sequence and vibrational b"

This position paper argues that, in order to understand AI, we cannot rely on our existing vocabulary of human words. Instead, we should strive to develop neologisms: new words that represent precise human concepts that we want to teach machines, or machine concepts that we need to learn. We start from the premise that humans and machines have differing concepts. This means interpretability can be framed as a communication problem: humans must be able to reference and control machine concepts, and communicate human concepts to machines. Creating a shared human-machine language through developing neologisms, we believe, could solve this communication problem. Successful neologisms achieve a useful amount of abstraction: not too detailed, so they're reusable in many contexts, and not too high-level, so they convey precise information. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how a "length neologism" enables controlling LLM response length, while a "diversity neologism" allows sampling more variable responses. Taken together, we argue that we cannot understand AI using our existing vocabulary, and expanding it through neologisms creates opportunities for both controlling and understanding machines better.

Proteins are dynamic molecular machines whose biological functions, spanning enzymatic catalysis, signal transduction, and structural adaptation, are intrinsically linked to their motions. Designing proteins with targeted dynamic properties, however, remains a challenge due to the complex, degenerate relationships between sequence, structure, and molecular motion. Here, we introduce VibeGen, a generative AI framework that enables end-to-end de novo protein design conditioned on normal mode vibrations. VibeGen employs an agentic dual-model architecture, comprising a protein designer that generates sequence candidates based on specified vibrational modes and a protein predictor that evaluates their dynamic accuracy. This approach synergizes diversity, accuracy, and novelty during the design process. Via full-atom molecular simulations as direct validation, we demonstrate that the designed proteins accurately reproduce the prescribed normal mode amplitudes across the backbone while adopting various stable, functionally relevant structures. Notably, generated sequences are de novo, exhibiting no significant similarity to natural proteins, thereby expanding the accessible protein space beyond evolutionary constraints. Our work integrates protein dynamics into generative protein design, and establishes a direct, bidirectional link between sequence and vibrational behavior, unlocking new pathways for engineering biomolecules with tailored dynamical and functional properties. This framework holds broad implications for the rational design of flexible enzymes, dynamic scaffolds, and biomaterials, paving the way toward dynamics-informed AI-driven protein engineering.
