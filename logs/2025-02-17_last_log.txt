This paper introduces and analyzes overthinking in LRMsa phenomenon where models favor extended internal reasoning chains over environmental interaction. Through experiments on software engineering tasks using SWE Bench Verified, we observe three recurring patterns: Analysis Paralysis, Rogue Actions, and Premature Disengagement. We propose framework to study these behaviors, which correlates with human expert assessments, and analyze 4018 trajectories. We observe that higher overthinking scores correlate with decreased performance, with reasoning models exhibiting stronger tendencies toward overthinking compared to non-reasoning models. Our analysis reveals that simple efforts to mitigate overthinking in agentic environments such as selecting the solution with the lower overthinking score can improve model performance by almost 30% while reducing computational costs by 43%. These results suggest that mitigating overthinking has strong practical implications. We suggest that by leveraging native function-calling capabilities and selective reinforcement learning overthinking tendencies could be mitigated. We also open-source our evaluation framework and dataset to facilitate research in this direction at https://github.com/ AlexCuadron/Overthinking. 1Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley, USA 2Department of Computer Science, ETH, Zurich, Switzerland 3Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois UrbanaChampaign, USA 4Department of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Correspondence to: Alejandro Cuadron <acuadron@berkeley.edu>. Figure 1. Higher overthinking scores (tendency to favor internal reasoning over environmental feedback) correlate with lower issue resolution rates across all models. Reasoning models exhibit consistently higher overthinking tendencies, suggesting that excessive reliance on internal simulation impairs task performance. Model nomenclature: FC indicates native function calling capability, DS represents DeepSeek models, and suffixes o1 high and o1 low denote models with reasoning effort set to high and low respectively. 1. Introduction Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) (Guan et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025), such as OpenAIs o1 (OpenAI, 2024e), Alibabas QwQ (Qwen, 2024b), or Deepseeks R1 (Guo et al., 2025) represent breakthrough in large language models (LLMs). These advanced systems have fundamentally redefined AIs problem-solving capabilities across various domains (Besta et al., 2025). In particular, LRMs selfcorrection abilities enable them to achieve impressive scores in several benchmarks, such as AIME 2024 (AoPS, 2024), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), or GPQA-Diamond (Rein et al., 2023) among others (Guo et al., 2025; OpenAI, 2024e;d; Qwen, 2024b; Guan et al., 2025). Despite extensive analysis of LRMs in non-agentic environ1 The Danger of Overthinking: Examining the Reasoning-Action Dilemma in Agentic Tasks Figure 2. OpenHands Execution Pipeline. 1) The system initializes by presenting the agent with the primary issue and previous action history. 2) The agent reaches decision point 2a) Direct action formulation and execution, or 2b) Internal simulation of potential actions and outcomes, potentially leading to overthinking. 3) The chosen action is executed, generating environmental feedback which updates the event stream. This cycle continues until task completion. ments, there remains critical gap in understanding how LRMs perform in agentic environments (Smeyatsky, 2024), where models must simultaneously gather, retain, and act upon new information to complete their tasks (Zhang et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024b). In this context, LRMs face fundamental challenge: models must choose between engaging directly with their environment or relying on internal reasoning about potential actions and their hypothetical consequences, challenge we define as the Reasoning-Action Dilemma. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of LRMs in agentic tasks at balancing the ReasoningAction Dilemma, using real-world software engineering tasks as our experimental framework (Jimenez et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024b). We employ SWE-bench Verified (Jimenez et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2024) as our benchmark, using the CodeAct agent scaffolding (Wang et al., 2024a) within the OpenHands framework (Wang et al., 2024c). This setup creates controlled environment where models must balance information gathering with reasoning chains while maintaining context across multiple interactions as illustrated in Figure 2. proper balance becomes critical as too much reliance on internal reasoning chains might lead to false assumptions about the environment. Figure 3. Performance comparison of Pass@k and Lowest Overthinking@k on SWE-bench Verified. Pass@k represents the success rate when considering solutions, while Lowest Overthinking@k shows the success rate when selecting the solution with minimal overthinking from samples. Using k=2 samples with low reasoning effort, we achieve 27.3% success rate while reducing computational costs by 43% compared to high reasoning configurations. Increasing to k=3 further improves performance to 30.3% surpassing the high configuration using 15% less computational costs. The confidence intervals (CI) were computed using Wilson score (Wallis, 2013). phenomenon we define as overthinking. To quantify overthinking, we develop and validate systematic evaluation framework using LLM-as-a-judge (Zheng et al., 2023) that identifies three key patterns: Analysis Paralysis, Rogue Actions, and Premature Disengagement (Figure 4). Our scoring system strongly correlates with human expert assessments (Figure 5), confirming its reliability in measuring models tendency to favor internal simulation over environmental interaction. We applied this framework to analyze 4018 trajectories, creating comprehensive open-source dataset to advance research in balancing reasoning and action in agentic environme"

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) represent a breakthrough in AI problem-solving capabilities, but their effectiveness in interactive environments can be limited. This paper introduces and analyzes overthinking in LRMs. A phenomenon where models favor extended internal reasoning chains over environmental interaction. Through experiments on software engineering tasks using SWE Bench Verified, we observe three recurring patterns: Analysis Paralysis, Rogue Actions, and Premature Disengagement. We propose a framework to study these behaviors, which correlates with human expert assessments, and analyze 4018 trajectories. We observe that higher overthinking scores correlate with decreased performance, with reasoning models exhibiting stronger tendencies toward overthinking compared to non-reasoning models. Our analysis reveals that simple efforts to mitigate overthinking in agentic environments, such as selecting the solution with the lower overthinking score, can improve model performance by almost 30% while reducing computational costs by 43%. These results suggest that mitigating overthinking has strong practical implications. We suggest that by leveraging native function-calling capabilities and selective reinforcement learning overthinking tendencies could be mitigated. We also open-source our evaluation framework and dataset to facilitate research in this direction at https://github.com/AlexCuadron/Overthinking.
