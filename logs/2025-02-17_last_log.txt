We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised finetuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA models distributions through forward data masking process and reverse process, parameterized by vanilla Transformer to predict masked tokens. By optimizing likelihood bound, it provides principled generative approach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive benchmarks, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability, outperforming our self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in reversal poem completion task. Our findings establish diffusion models as viable and promising alternative to ARMs, challenging the assumption that key LLM capabilities discussed above are inherently tied to ARMs. Project page and codes: https: //ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/.

Specifically, LLMs aim to capture the true but unknown language *Equal contribution Work done during an internship at Ant Group Project leaders 1Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Big Data Management and Analysis Methods 2Ant Group. Correspondence to: Chongxuan Li <chongxuanli@ruc.edu.cn>. Preprint. The predominant approach relies on the autoregressive modeling (ARM)commonly referred to as the next-token prediction paradigmto define the model distribution: pθ(x) = pθ(x1) (cid:89) pθ(xi x1, . . . , xi1) , (2) (cid:124) i=2 (cid:123)(cid:122) Autoregressive formulation (cid:125) where is sequence of length L, and xi is the i-th token. This paradigm has proven remarkably effective (Radford, 2018; Radford et al., 2019; Brown, 2020; OpenAI, 2022) and has become the foundation of current LLMs. Despite its widespread adoption, fundamental question remains unanswered: Is the autoregressive paradigm the only viable path to achieving the intelligence exhibited by LLMs? 1 Large Language Diffusion Models We argue that the answer is not simple yes. The key insight overlooked previously is: it is the generative modeling principles (i.e., Eq. (1)), rather than the autoregressive formulation (i.e., Eq. (2)) itself, that fundamentally underpin the essential properties of LLMs, as detailed below. However, certain inherent limitations of LLMs can be directly traced to their autoregressive nature. In particular, we argue that scalability is primarily consequence of the interplay between Transformers (Vaswani, 2017), model and data size, and Fisher consistency1 (Fisher, 1922) induced by the generative principles in Eq. (1), rather than unique result of ARM. The success of diffusion transformers (Bao et al., 2023; Peebles & Xie, 2023) on visual data (Brooks et al., 2024) supports this claim. Furthermore, the capabilities of instruction-following and in-context learning (Brown, 2020) appear to be intrinsic properties of all proper conditional generative models on structurally consistent linguistic tasks, rather than exclusive advantages of ARMs. In addition, while ARMs can be interpreted as lossless data compressor (Deletang et al.; Huang et al., 2024b), any sufficiently expressive probabilistic model can achieve similar capabilities (Shannon, 1948). Nevertheless, the autoregressive nature of LLMs presents notable challenges. For example, sequential token-by-token generation incurs high computational costs, and the leftto-right modeling limits effectiveness in reversal reasoning tasks (Berglund et al., 2023). These inherent limitations constrain LLMs in handling longer and more complex tasks. Motivated by these insights, we introduce LLaDA, Large Language Diffusion with mAsking, to investigate whether the capabilities exhibited by LLMs can emerge from generative modeling principles beyond ARMs in Eq. (2), thereby addressing the fundamental question posed earlier. In contrast to traditional ARMs, LLaDA leverages masked diffusion model (MDM) (Austin et al., 2021a; Ou et al., 2024), which incorporates discrete random masking process and trains mask predictor to approximate its reverse process. This design enables LLaDA to construct model distribution with bidirectional dependencies and optimize lower bound of its log-likelihood, offering an unexplored and principled alternative to existing LLMs. We adopt the standard pipeline of data preparation, pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and evaluation, scaling LLaDA to an unprecedented language diffusion of size 8B. In particular, LLaDA 8B was pre-trained from scratch on 2.3 trillion tokens using 0.13 million H800 GPU hours, followed by SFT on 4.5 million pairs. Across diverse tasks, including language understanding, math, code, and Chinese, LLaDA demonstrates the following contributions: 1It suggests the ability to recover the true data distribution with infinite data, sufficiently large network and optimal training. Scalability. LLaDA scales effectively up to computational budget of 1023 FLOPs, achieving comparable results to selfconstructed ARM baselines trained on the same data across six tasks, e.g., MMLU and GSM8K. In-Context Learning. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B surpasses LLaMA2 7B (Touvron et al., 2023) on nearly all 15 standard zero/few-shot learning tasks while performing on par with LLaMA3 8B (Dubey et al., 2024).

Primack, Zifan Wang # zifan.wang@scale.com (cid:128) https://scale.com/research/j2 Abstract Refusal training on Large Language Models (LLMs) prevents harmful outputs, yet this defense remains vulnerable to both automated and human-crafted jailbreaks. We present novel LLM-as-red-teamer approach in which human jailbreaks refusal-trained LLM to make it willing to jailbreak itself or other LLMs. We refer to the jailbroken LLMs as J2 attackers, which can systematically evaluate target models using various red teaming strategies and improve its performance via in-context learning from the previous failures. Our experiments demonstrate that Sonnet-3.5 and Gemini-1.5-pro outperform other LLMs as J2, achieving 93.0% and 91.0% attack success rates (ASRs) respectively against GPT-4o (and similar results across other capable LLMs) on Harmbench. Our work not only introduces scalable approach to strategic red teamingdrawing inspiration from human red teamers, but also highlights jailbreaking-to-jailbreak as an overlooked failure mode of the safeguard. Specifically, an LLM can bypass its own safeguards by employing jailbroken version of itself that is willing to assist in further jailbreaking. To prevent any direct misuse with J2, while advancing research in AI safety, we publicly share our methodology while keeping specific prompting details private.

We use diverse inference approach that combines multiple models and methods at test time. We find that verifying mathematics and code problems, and rejection sampling on other problems is simple and effective. We automatically verify correctness of solutions to IMO problems by Lean, and ARC puzzles by code, and find that best-ofN effectively answers HLE questions. Our approach increases answer accuracy on IMO combinatorics problems from 33.3% to 77.8%, accuracy on HLE questions from 8% to 37%, and solves 80% of ARC puzzles that 948 humans could not and 26.5% of ARC puzzles that o3 high compute does not. Test-time simulations, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning with inference feedback improve generalization by adapting agent graph representations and varying prompts, code, and datasets. Our approach is reliable, robust, and scalable, and in the spirit of reproducible research, we will make it publicly available upon publication. 1. Introduction Reasoning LLMs such as OpenAI o1 (OpenAI, 2024) and o3 (OpenAI, 2025b), as well as DeepSeek R1 (Guo et al., 2025), have led to impressive performance in mathematics, coding, and problem solving. Despite this progress, single large 1Boston University 2NotBadMath.AI 3Google 4Columbia University 5Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6Intuit 7Stanford University. Correspondence to: Iddo Drori <idrori@bu.edu>. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). model or method may struggle with challenging tasks. To address this, diversity, of models and methods for inference, has emerged as mechanism to increase performance by using complementary strengths. We demonstrate the advantages of diverse inference on three representative and challenging benchmarks: International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO, 2024) combinatorics problems: We increase the accuracy from 33.3% to 77.8% correct answers. Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019): We solve 80% of puzzles that 948 humans collectively could not solve, and 26.5% of puzzles that o3 high compute could not solve. Humanitys Last Exam (HLE) (Phan et al., 2025): We increase accuracy from 8% to 37% on this set of questions across mathematics, humanities, social sciences, and others. Three key methodological contributions drive these results: 1. Diverse inference. We aggregate multiple models, methods, and agents at test time rather than relying on single model or method. Any single correct solution is validated automatically for the verifiable tasks of IMO combinatorics and ARC puzzles. Specifically: IMO: Using eight different methods (LEAP, Z3, RTO, BoN, SC, MoA, MCTS, PV) significantly increases accuracy. We autoformalize English into Lean, enabling perfect verification. ARC: Synthesized code solutions are verified on training examples as unit tests. HLE: Using best-of-N as an imperfect verifer, increases the solve rate with increased samples. 2. Test-time simulations and reinforcement learning. We generate additional problem-specific information at inference time:IMO: Transform combinatorics problems into interactive game environments and apply combinatorial search or deep reinforcement learning to derive partial results or bounds. ARC: Exploring puzzle transformations by synthesized code prunes incorrect solutions and refines candidate solutions. Searching using trained verifiers often outperforms supervised fine-tuning given the same dataset (Cobbe et al., 2021), which motivates reinforcement learning fine-tuning. We run simulations and reinforcement learning at test time to generate additional data that allows us to correctly prove 2024 IMO combinatorics problem and solve difficult ARC puzzles. 3. Meta-learning of agent graphs. We use LLMs and tools to trace pipeline runs, generate A/B tests of hyperparameters, prompts, code variations, and data, and adaptively modify the agent graph. From mixture of experts to diverse models and methods. Most recent language models use mixture of experts (Jiang et al., 2024), where multiple experts are trained to specialize in different aspects of the input space. gating mechanism learns to select or weigh the experts based on input. The diversity in expertise allows the model to use broad range of problem-solving strategies, and distribution among diverse experts allows the model to handle variations better. Large-scale transformers that leverage diversity (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) increase efficiency and accuracy, otherwise difficult to achieve with single monolithic model. In this work, we use diverse models and methods to increase accuracy. Perfect and imperfect verifiers. An imperfect verifier generates false positives, which are wrong solutions that pass the verifier. These false positives impose an upper bound on accuracy despite the increase in sampling or inference time compute (Stroebl et al., 2024). In this work, we use perfect verifiers for the IMO and ARC and an imperfect verifier for the HLE. Specifically, for the IMO, we use Lean as perfect verifier and generate additional ground truth samples by simulation. For the ARC we use code execution on the training examples as perfect verifiers. For the HLE we use best-of-N sampling as an imperfect verifier. Empirical scaling laws. The two most common empirical scaling laws for foundation model performance are: et al., 2022). Scaling laws extend to fine-tuning, describing the relationship between model performance and the number of fine tuning parameters and finetuning data size (Zhang et al., 2024a), and extend to different architectures and downstream tasks (Caballero et al., 2022). 2. The relationship between model performance and testtime compute. The tradeoff between training time and test time compute has been demonstrated early on for board games (Jones, 2021), showing that increasing either one leads to better performance. Test time compute scaling (Sardana et al., 2023) has recently been demonstrated again by DeepMind on coding "

Autoregressive models (ARMs) are widely regarded as the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs). We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA models distributions through a forward data masking process and a reverse process, parameterized by a vanilla Transformer to predict masked tokens. By optimizing a likelihood bound, it provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive benchmarks, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability, outperforming our self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal poem completion task. Our findings establish diffusion models as a viable and promising alternative to ARMs, challenging the assumption that key LLM capabilities discussed above are inherently tied to ARMs.

Refusal training on Large Language Models (LLMs) prevents harmful outputs, yet this defense remains vulnerable to both automated and human-crafted jailbreaks. We present a novel LLM-as-red-teamer approach in which a human jailbreaks a refusal-trained LLM to make it willing to jailbreak itself or other LLMs. We refer to the jailbroken LLMs as J_2 attackers, which can systematically evaluate target models using various red teaming strategies and improve its performance via in-context learning from the previous failures. Our experiments demonstrate that Sonnet 3.5 and Gemini 1.5 pro outperform other LLMs as J_2, achieving 93.0% and 91.0% attack success rates (ASRs) respectively against GPT-4o (and similar results across other capable LLMs) on Harmbench. Our work not only introduces a scalable approach to strategic red teaming, drawing inspiration from human red teamers, but also highlights jailbreaking-to-jailbreak as an overlooked failure mode of the safeguard. Specifically, an LLM can bypass its own safeguards by employing a jailbroken version of itself that is willing to assist in further jailbreaking. To prevent any direct misuse with J_2, while advancing research in AI safety, we publicly share our methodology while keeping specific prompting details private.

Reasoning LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 have made significant progress in mathematics and coding, yet find challenging advanced tasks such as International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) combinatorics problems, Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) puzzles, and Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) questions. We use a diverse inference approach that combines multiple models and methods at test time. We find that verifying mathematics and code problems, and rejection sampling on other problems is simple and effective. We automatically verify correctness of solutions to IMO problems by Lean, and ARC puzzles by code, and find that best-of-N effectively answers HLE questions. Our approach increases answer accuracy on IMO combinatorics problems from 33.3% to 77.8%, accuracy on HLE questions from 8% to 37%, and solves 80% of ARC puzzles that 948 humans could not and 26.5% of ARC puzzles that o3 high compute does not. Test-time simulations, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning with inference feedback improve generalization by adapting agent graph representations and varying prompts, code, and datasets. Our approach is reliable, robust, and scalable, and in the spirit of reproducible research, we will make it publicly available upon publication.

We use a diverse inference approach that combines multiple models and methods at test time. We find that verifying mathematics and code problems, and rejection sampling on other problems is simple and effective. We automatically verify correctness of solutions to IMO problems by Lean, and ARC puzzles by code, and find that best-of-N effectively answers HLE questions. Our approach increases answer accuracy on IMO combinatorics problems from 33.3% to 77.8%, accuracy on HLE questions from 8% to 37%, and solves 80% of ARC puzzles that 948 humans could not and 26.5% of ARC puzzles that o3 high compute does not. Test-time simulations, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning with inference feedback improve generalization by adapting agent graph representations and varying prompts, code, and datasets. Our approach is reliable, robust, and scalable, and in the spirit of reproducible research, we will make it publicly available upon publication."
