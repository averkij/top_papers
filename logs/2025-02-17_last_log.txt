Despite this, they attain high scores on many popular visual benchmarks, with headroom rapidly eroded by an ongoing surge of model progress. To address this, there is pressing need for difficult benchmarks that remain relevant for longer. We take this idea to its limit by introducing ZeroBench lightweight visual reasoning benchmark that is entirely impossible for contemporary frontier LMMs. Our benchmark consists of 100 manually curated questions and 334 less difficult subquestions. We evaluate 20 LMMs on ZeroBench, all of which score 0.0%, and rigorously analyse the errors. To encourage progress in visual understanding, we publicly release ZeroBench at https://zerobench.github.io/. 1. Introduction Numerous works have demonstrated the broad capabilities of foundation models in language-based tasks, such as knowledge-based question answering (Hendrycks et al., 2020), information retrieval (Kamradt, 2023), and even conducting end-to-end machine learning research with mini1University of Cambridge, 2University of Alberta, 4The University of Hong Kong, 3Independent Researcher, 5University of Tubingen, 7Auburn 6University of Oxford, University.

By comparison, our ZeroBench proves impossible for current models, leaving maximum headroom. mal guidance (Schmidgall et al., 2025). However, when it comes to image-text multimodal tasks, the results for LMMs are more nuanced. Although possessing impressive multimodal abilities in some cases (Yang et al., 2023), growing body of work indicates significant flaws in the visual interpretation and reasoning of LMMs. In particular, LMMs have been shown to struggle with low-level reasoning tasks such as counting and identifying points of intersection (Rahmanzadehgervi et al., 2024) or localising points on maps (Roberts et al., 2024c); they also appear to have inferior spatial cognition skills to animals (Ramakrishnan et al., 2024). series of benchmarks have been proposed to measure and track the visual capabilities of LMMs in various domains (Ramakrishnan et al., 2024; Rahmanzadehgervi et al., 2024; Padlewski et al., 2024). Despite falling short on visual interpretation, rapid progress has been made on these benchmarks, with new State of the Art (SotA) scores steadily eroding the benchmark headroomthe difference between the maximum possible and SotA scores (Fig 1). Fig. 2 illustrates this observation, with increasing performance on several visual benchmarks within months. As the headroom ZeroBench process that encouraged creativity. Focusing on small set of well-reviewed questions also ensures ZeroBench is (4) high-quality and noise-free label errors in popular benchmarks (Northcutt et al., 2021) limit headroom and reduce evaluation reliability. We evaluate 20 frontier LMM baselines on ZeroBench, finding it to be considerable challenge. Results are reported using both pass@1 and pass@k evaluation. Following similar approach to (Xu et al., 2024), to differentiate model performance we decompose the questions into steps that are useful and related to the final answer and evaluate performance on these steps. We carry out rigorous error analysis, including qualitative examples of model answers, and compare the prevalence of visual errors versus reasoning errors. To summarise, our core contributions are 3-fold: We introduce ZeroBench, lightweight, challenging visual reasoning benchmark for LMMs consisting of 100 hand-crafted questions and 334 subquestions. We evaluate 20 models on ZeroBench, all of whichscore 0.0% across the board on the main questions. Through fine-grained error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes across various models. Our findings reveal common patterns of mistakes, primarily related to the visual interpretation of inputs. These errors prevent models from arriving at the correct final answer, regardless of their reasoning capabilities. 2. Related Work 2.1. Visual Benchmarks Numerous benchmarks aim to evaluate LMM capabilities on multimodal tasks (Li et al., 2024). Motivated by the potential downstream applications, some works introduce tasks with specific domains in mind, such as scientific and mathematical figure interpretation (Roberts et al., 2024b; Lu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024b), visual coding (Zhang et al., 2024), geospatial and remote sensing (Roberts et al., 2024c; Muhtar et al., 2024), video game glitch detection (Taesiri et al., 2024) and medicine (Chen et al., 2024). Conversely, there are many benchmarks concentrating on evaluating visual capabilities agnostic to applications or domains. Several such works provide broad and holistic evaluation of capabilities, such as SEED-Bench (Li et al., 2023), MMBench (Liu et al., 2025) or MM-Vet (Yu et al., 2023). In contrast, others target specific properties of visual interpretation. PreLMM benchmarks, such as, CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2017) and CVR (Zerroug et al., 2022), focus on compositional visual reasoning. ReMI (Kazemi et al., 2024) evaluates visual reasoning across multiple images, while Encyclopedic VQA (Mensink et al., 2023) asks visual questions requiring encyclopedic knowledge of fine-grained categories. LogicVista Figure 2. Rapid progress was made on visual benchmarks last year.

Text:"FoNE: Precise Single-Token Number Embeddings via Fourier Features Department of Computer Science University of Southern California Los Angeles, CA 90089 {tzhou029,deqingfu,soltanol,robinjia,vsharan}@usc.edu Abstract Large Language Models (LLMs) typically represent numbers using multiple tokens, which requires the model to aggregate these tokens to interpret numerical values. This fragmentation makes both training and inference less efficient and adversely affects the models performance on number-related tasks. Inspired by the observation that pre-trained LLMs internally learn Fourier-like features for number tokens, we propose Fourier Number Embedding (FoNE), novel method that directly maps numbers into the embedding space with their Fourier features. FoNE encodes each number as single token with only two embedding dimensions per digit, effectively capturing numerical values without fragmentation. This compact representation accelerates both training and inference. Compared to traditional subword and digit-wise embeddings, FoNE not only reduces computational overhead but also achieves higher accuracy across various numerical tasks including addition, subtraction and multiplication. On 6-digit decimal addition, FoNE requires 64 less data to achieve 99% accuracy than subword and digitwise embeddings while using 3 and 6 fewer tokens per number, respectively. Furthermore, FoNE is the only method that yields 100% accuracy on over 100,000 test examples for addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

User prompts are encoded using two bilingual text encoders to handle both English and Chinese. DiT with 3D full attention is trained using Flow Matching and is employed to denoise input noise into latent frames. video-based DPO approach, Video-DPO, is applied to reduce artifacts and improve the visual quality of the generated videos. We also detail our training strategies and share key observations and insights. Step-Video-T2Vs performance is evaluated on novel video generation benchmark, Step-Video-T2VEval, demonstrating its state-of-the-art text-to-video quality when compared with both open-source and commercial engines. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of current diffusion-based model paradigm and outline future directions for video foundation models. We make both Step-Video-T2V and Step-Video-T2V-Eval available at https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step-Video-T2V. The online version can be accessed from https://yuewen.cn/videos as well. Our goal is to accelerate the innovation of video foundation models and empower video content creators.A video foundation model is model pre-trained on large video datasets that can generate videos in response to text, visual, or multimodal inputs from users. It can be applied to wide range of downstream video-related tasks, such as text/image/video-to-video generation, video understanding and editing, as well as video-based conversion, question answering, and task completion. Based on our understanding, we define two levels towards building video foundation models. Level-1: translational video foundation model. model at this level functions as cross-modal translation system, capable of generating videos from text, visual, or multimodal context. Level-2: predictable video foundation model. model at this level acts as prediction system, similar to large language models (LLMs), that can forecast future events based on text, visual, or multimodal context and handle more advanced tasks, such as reasoning with multimodal data or simulating real-world scenarios. Current diffusion-based text-to-video models, such as Sora, Veo, Kling, Hailuo, and Step-Video (as described in this report), belong to Level-1. These models can generate high-quality videos from text prompts, lowering the barrier for creators to produce video content. However, they often fail to generate videos that require complex action sequences (such as gymnastic performance) or adherence to the laws of physics (such as basketball bouncing on the floor), let alone performing causal or logical tasks like LLMs. Such limitations arise because these models learn only the mappings between text prompts and corresponding videos, without explicitly modeling the underlying causal relationships within videos. Autoregression-based text-to-video models introduce the causal modeling mechanism by predicting the next video token, frame, or clip. However, these models still cannot achieve performance comparable to diffusion-based models on text-to-video generation. This report will detail the practice of building Step-Video-T2V as state-of-the-art video foundation model at Level-1. By analyzing the challenges identified through experiments, we will also highlight key problems that need to be addressed in order to develop video foundation models at Level-2.Large language models (LLMs), as part of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), has made impressive progress in recent years. These models are capable of understanding human instructions and generating coherent, fluent responses in natural language. However, language is symbolic abstraction of thought, using words and concepts to represent the world. This abstraction often falls short in capturing the complexity and richness of reality, particularly when it comes to dynamic processes like object motion or the intricate spatial and temporal relationships between entities. As result, video generation has emerged as an important frontier in the pursuit of AGI, offering pathway toward bridging these cognitive gaps. Moreover, video content is now the dominant form of communication and entertainment online. Build video generation systems capable of generating high-quality videos can significantly lower the barriers for content creators and democratize video production, enabling everyone, from amateurs to professionals, to produce compelling video content with minimal effort. In this technical report, we present Step-Video-T2V, state-of-the-art video foundation model with 30B parameters, capable of generating high-quality videos from text, featuring strong motion dynamics, high aesthetics, and consistent content. Like most commercial video generation engines, Step-Video-T2V is diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based model trained using Flow Matching. specially designed deep compression Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) achieves 16x16 spatial and 8x temporal compression ratios, significantly reducing the computational complexity of large-scale video generation training. Two bilingual text encoders enable Step-Video-T2V to directly understand Chinese or English prompts. cascaded training pipeline, including text-to-image pre-training, text-to-video pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and direct preference optimization (DPO), is introduced to accelerate model convergence and fully leverage video datasets of varying quality. new benchmark dataset called Step-Video-T2V-Eval is created for text-to-video generation, which includes 128 diverse prompts across 11 categories, alongside video generation results from several top text-to-video open-source and commercial engines for comparison. Insights are gained throughout the entire development of Step-Video-T2V, spanning data, model, training, and inference. First, text-to-image pre-training is essential for the video generation model to acquire rich visual knowledge, including concepts, scenes, and their spatial relationships, providing solid foundation for the subsequent text-to-video pre"

Diffusion models (DMs) have become the leading choice for generative tasks across diverse domains. However, their reliance on multiple sequential forward passes significantly limits real-time performance. Previous acceleration methods have primarily focused on reducing the number of sampling steps or reusing intermediate results, failing to leverage variations across spatial regions within the image due to the constraints of convolutional U-Net structures. By harnessing the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in handling variable number of tokens, we introduce RAS, a novel, training-free sampling strategy that dynamically assigns different sampling ratios to regions within an image based on the focus of the DiT model. Our key observation is that during each sampling step, the model concentrates on semantically meaningful regions, and these areas of focus exhibit strong continuity across consecutive steps. Leveraging this insight, RAS updates only the regions currently in focus, while other regions are updated using cached noise from the previous step. The model's focus is determined based on the output from the preceding step, capitalizing on the temporal consistency we observed. We evaluate RAS on Stable Diffusion 3 and Lumina-Next-T2I, achieving speedups up to 2.36x and 2.51x, respectively, with minimal degradation in generation quality. Additionally, a user study reveals that RAS delivers comparable qualities under human evaluation while achieving a 1.6x speedup.

"Diffusion models (DMs) have become the leading choice for generative tasks across diverse domains. However, their reliance on multiple sequential forward passes significantly limits real-time performance. Previous acceleration methods have primarily focused on reducing the number of sampling steps or reusing intermediate results, failing to leverage variations across spatial regions within the image due to the constraints of convolutional U-Net structures. By harnessing the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in handling variable number of tokens, we introduce RAS, a novel, training-free sampling strategy that dynamically assigns different sampling ratios to regions within an image based on the focus of the DiT model. Our key observation is that during each sampling step, the model concentrates on semantically meaningful regions, and these areas of focus exhibit strong continuity across consecutive steps. Leveraging this insight, RAS updates only the regions currently in focus, while other regions are updated using cached noise from the previous step.

Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) exhibit major shortfalls when interpreting images and, by some measures, have poorer spatial cognition than small children or animals. Despite this, they attain high scores on many popular visual benchmarks, with headroom rapidly eroded by an ongoing surge of model progress. To address this, there is a pressing need for difficult benchmarks that remain relevant for longer. We take this idea to its limit by introducing ZeroBench-a lightweight visual reasoning benchmark that is entirely impossible for contemporary frontier LMMs. Our benchmark consists of 100 manually curated questions and 334 less difficult subquestions. We evaluate 20 LMMs on ZeroBench, all of which score 0.0%, and rigorously analyse the errors. To encourage progress in visual understanding, we publicly release ZeroBench.

Despite notable advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), most state-of-the-art models have not undergone thorough alignment with human preferences. This gap exists because current alignment research has primarily achieved progress in specific areas (e.g., hallucination reduction), while the broader question of whether aligning models with human preferences can systematically enhance MLLM capability remains largely unexplored. To this end, we introduce MM-RLHF, a dataset containing 120k fine-grained, human-annotated preference comparison pairs. This dataset represents a substantial advancement over existing resources, offering superior size, diversity, annotation granularity, and quality. Leveraging this dataset, we propose several key innovations to improve both the quality of reward models and the efficiency of alignment algorithms. Notably, we introduce a Critique-Based Reward Model, which generates critiques of model outputs before assigning scores, offering enhanced interpretability and more informative feedback compared to traditional scalar reward mechanisms. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Reward Scaling, a method that adjusts the loss weight of each sample according to the reward signal, thereby optimizing the use of high-quality comparison pairs. Our approach is rigorously evaluated across 10 distinct dimensions and 27 benchmarks, with results demonstrating significant and consistent improvements in model performance. Specifically, fine-tuning LLaVA-ov-7B with MM-RLHF and our alignment algorithm leads to a 19.5% increase in conversational abilities and a 60% improvement in safety.   We have open-sourced the preference dataset, reward model, training and evaluation code, as well as reward modeling and safety benchmarks.

Large Language Models (LLMs) typically represent numbers using multiple tokens, which requires the model to aggregate these tokens to interpret numerical values. This fragmentation makes both training and inference less efficient and adversely affects the model's performance on number-related tasks. Inspired by the observation that pre-trained LLMs internally learn Fourier-like features for number tokens, we propose Fourier Number Embedding (FoNE), a novel method that directly maps numbers into the embedding space with their Fourier features. FoNE encodes each number as a single token with only two embedding dimensions per digit, effectively capturing numerical values without fragmentation. This compact representation accelerates both training and inference. Compared to traditional subword and digit-wise embeddings, FoNE not only reduces computational overhead but also achieves higher accuracy across various numerical tasks including addition, subtraction and multiplication. On 6-digit decimal addition, FoNE requires 64times less data to achieve 99% accuracy than subword and digit-wise embeddings while using 3times and 6times fewer tokens per number, respectively. Furthermore, FoNE is the only method that yields 100% accuracy on over 100,000 test examples for addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The codes and visualization are available at https://fouriernumber.github.io/.

We present Step-Video-T2V, a state-of-the-art text-to-video pre-trained model with 30B parameters and the ability to generate videos up to 204 frames in length. A deep compression Variational Autoencoder, Video-VAE, is designed for video generation tasks, achieving 16x16 spatial and 8x temporal compression ratios, while maintaining exceptional video reconstruction quality. User prompts are encoded using two bilingual text encoders to handle both English and Chinese. A DiT with 3D full attention is trained using Flow Matching and is employed to denoise input noise into latent frames. A video-based DPO approach, Video-DPO, is applied to reduce artifacts and improve the visual quality of the generated videos. We also detail our training strategies and share key observations and insights. Step-Video-T2V's performance is evaluated on a novel video generation benchmark, Step-Video-T2V-Eval, demonstrating its state-of-the-art text-to-video quality when compared with both open-source and commercial engines. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of current diffusion-based model paradigm and outline future directions for video foundation models.
