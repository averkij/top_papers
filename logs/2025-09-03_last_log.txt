[ 1 6 7 6 0 0 . 9 0 5 2 : r LLaVA-Critic-R1: Your Critic Model is Secretly Strong Policy Model Xiyao Wang1, Chunyuan Li, Jianwei Yang, Kai Zhang2, Bo Liu3, Tianyi Xiong1, Furong Huang1 1University of Maryland, College Park 2The Ohio State University 3National University of Singapore In visionlanguage modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate outputsassigning scalar scores or pairwise preferencesrather than to generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals and perform reinforcement learning directly on base generative model, producing LLaVA-CriticR1, multimodal critic trained to optimize preference judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly, LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as top-performing critic but also as competitive policy modelmatching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5VL-7B). Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing critic quality, achieving SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale. Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal that RL training on critic data can produce unified model excelling at both evaluation and generation, offering simple path toward scalable, self-improving multimodal systems.

Text:"UI-TARS-2 Technical Report: Advancing GUI Agent with Multi-Turn Reinforcement LearningSee Contributions section for full author list.The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning, action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we present UI-TARS-2, native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these challenges through systematic training methodology: data flywheel for scalable data generation, stabilized multi-turn RL framework, hybrid GUI environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and unified sandbox platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5. On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains mean normalized score of 59.8 across 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level performanceand remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g., OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks, highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2s potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization to real-world interactive scenarios.

Traditional approaches typically adopt modular pipelines with separately engineered components for perception, planning, memory, and action [34]. While such design-driven systems enable rapid progress in specific domains, they rely heavily on expert heuristics and task-specific rules, leaving them brittle and difficult to scale. Recent work on native agent models [49] shifts toward data-driven, end-to-end learning, where perception, reasoning, and control are unified within single policy, offering more scalable and adaptive path for GUI agents. Despite recent progress, the development of robust GUI agents still faces several open challenges. (1) Data scarcity. While large-scale pre-training and reinforcement learning have proven effective in reasoning and chat domains [27, 41], scalable strategies for long-horizon GUI learning remain unclear. Unlike text or code corpora, large-scale trajectories that capture detailed reasoning, actions, environment states, and feedback are extremely costly to collect. (2) Scalable multi-turn RL. RL in interactive environments is notoriously difficult: rewards are often sparse or delayed, optimization can be unstable, and credit assignment across long sequences of actions remains challenging. These issues hinder scaling beyond short-horizon demonstrations and make it hard to achieve stable improvements in complex tasks. (3) Limitations of GUI-only operation. Pure GUI interaction is often insufficient for realistic workflows. Many taskssuch as data processing, software development, or system administrationare more naturally handled through file systems, terminals, or external tools rather than by simulating mouse clicks and keystrokes. Thus, advancing GUI agents requires environments that allow graphical actions to interoperate seamlessly with other resources, broadening the scope of tasks they can effectively solve. (4) Environment scalability and stability. Even with richer interaction capabilities, deploying large-scale RL environments remains an engineering bottleneck. Rollouts must be reproducible, fault-tolerant, and capable of supporting millions of interactive episodes acro"

Reinforcement learning on preference-labeled critic datasets enhances a generative model's performance, creating a unified multimodal system that excels in both evaluation and generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model, producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly, LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B). Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale. Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable, self-improving multimodal systems.

UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model, addresses challenges in data scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning, and environment stability, achieving significant improvements over its predecessor and strong baselines across various benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning, action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5. On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g., OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks, highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization to real-world interactive scenarios.

Genetic Prompt enhances synthetic data quality and diversity in NLP by combining genetic algorithms with LLMs, improving downstream model performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

VARIN, a noise inversion-based editing technique for visual autoregressive models, enables precise image editing aligned with textual prompts while preserving original details.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing approach.

FlashAdventure benchmark and COAST framework improve GUI agents' performance in completing full story arcs in Flash-based adventure games by addressing the observation-behavior gap.  					AI-generated summary 				 GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts to narrow this divide.
