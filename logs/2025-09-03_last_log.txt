Text:"5 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 8 0 2 2 0 . 9 0 5 2 : r Baichuan-M2: Scaling Medical Capability with Large Verifier System Baichuan-M2 TeamAs large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become critical research focus. However, there is notable gap between the performance of medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To address this challenge, we introduce novel dynamic verification framework that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing large-scale, high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework comprises two key components: Patient Simulator that creates realistic clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and Clinical Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, 32B-parameter medical augmented reasoning model trained through multi-stage reinforcement learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmarkpreviously exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical applications, establishing new Pareto front in the performance-parameter trade-off for medical AI deployment.As the conversational and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, there is increasing interest in their practical application in specific domains. The healthcare sector, in particular, has become key area of research, attracting significant investment from both global tech giants and innovative startups [13]. Among the various approaches aimed at enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in healthcare, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has garnered considerable attention [4, 5]. This technique has already demonstrated impressive results in areas such as mathematics [68], code [9], agents [10, 11], and multimodality [12, 13]. These achievements highlight its potential to significantly enhance model reasoning, making its application in healthcare highly promising research direction. The core of RLVR lies in the development of robust evaluation system. Its success in fields like mathematics and coding can be attributed to the availability of precise and reliable evaluation metrics. However, when it comes to assessing LLMs in the medical domain, significant gap exists between current evaluation methods and real-world applications. Models that perform well on medical professional exams, such as the USMLE [14], often underperform in practical clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional static benchmarks fail to capture the dynamic and complex nature of clinical practice. Real-world medical consultations frequently involve incomplete information, multiple rounds of diagnostic exploration, and nuanced communication skills, all of which are not adequately measured by conventional exams. To address these challenges, we transitioned our focus from static answer verifiers to the development of large-scale, high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning verifier system. This system transcends conventional answer verifier by simulating real-world clinical scenarios, allowing the model to learn and adapt through simulated practice in virtual clinical environment. Building on this foundation, we introduce Baichuan-M2, medical augmented reasoning model that marks significant advancement in open-source medical artificial intelligence. Specifically, our verifier system comprises two key components. The first is Patient Simulator, which integrates desensitized medical records and doctor-patient conversation records to effectively simulate patients with diverse social backgrounds and personality traits. This provides highly realistic interactive environment. The second component is Clinical Rubrics Generator, which can emulate the clinical reasoning of experienced doctors. It dynamically generates quantifiable evaluation rubrics on large scale, based on multiple dimensions such as diagnostic accuracy, consultation logic, treatment plan rationality, communication empathy, and medical ethics. Our training process includes mid-training for medical domain adaptation, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with rejection sampling, and multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) using an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [8] algorithm. Specifically, we employ multi-stage reinforcement learning strategy to decompose complex reinforcement learning tasks into controllable hierarchical structure. This approach enhances various capabilities, including medical knowledge, reasoning, and patient interaction, while maintaining the general capabilities of the model. We evaluate our model on the challenging HealthBench dataset [15], developed by OpenAI. Despite its relatively small number of parameters (only 32B), Baichuan-M2 outperformed all other open-source models, including gpt-oss-120B, and most advanced closed-source counterparts on HealthBench. It particularly excelled on the HealthBench Hard test, achieving score exceeding 32, performance level previously reached by only one other model globally, GPT-5. These experimental results underscore the critical role of robust validation system in integrating model capabilities with practical applications. In summary, our contributions can be highlighted as follows: dynamic verifier system tailored for clinical scenarios, which addresses the limitations of previous verification methods based on static data. This method employs patient simulator to create highfidelity decision-making environment and uses clinical rubrics to generate quantitative evaluation metrics in real time, thereby enhancing the reliability of the verification process. An advanced training method that successfully implements multi-stage reinforcement learning strategy in dynamic interactive environment, featuring targeted improvements to the GRPO algorithm. This enhancement enables the model to move beyond static knowledge memorization and"

VerlTool is a unified and modular framework for Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use, addressing inefficiencies in existing approaches and providing competitive performance across multiple domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous rollout execution achieving near 2times speedup by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video), extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

A dynamic verification framework using reinforcement learning and a novel algorithm improves the performance of a large medical language model in real-world clinical decision-making.  					AI-generated summary 				 As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale, high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter trade-off for medical AI deployment.

Context-Aware Fusion enhances DiffusionDet by integrating global scene context with local features using cross-attention, improving performance on fine-grained object detection tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains
