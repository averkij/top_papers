Our experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both baselines on training speed, and achieves superior or competitive final validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as promising and efficient alternative for sequence modeling.Since its introduction, the Transformer [11] has revolutionized the field of natural language processing. Its central innovation, the self-attention mechanism, allows for rich, pairwise interactions between all tokens in sequence, capturing complex dependencies regardless of their distance. This capability has led to state-of-the-art results across vast array of tasks. However, this expressive power comes at steep computational cost. The self-attention mechanism requires dot-product between Query and Key matrices of size (N, d), resulting in an attention map of size (N, N), where is the sequence length and is the model dimension. This leads to computational and memory complexity of O(N 2d), which is prohibitive for applications involving very long sequences, such as high-resolution document summarization, genomic data analysis, or processing lengthy video streams. This quadratic bottleneck has spurred wave of research into Efficient Transformers [10], which aim to approximate the self-attention matrix using methods like sparsity [1], low-rank factorization [12], or kernelization [2]. While successful, these methods often introduce architectural complexity or trade-offs in expressivity. Another line of work has revisited recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs), which are naturally O(N ) [6]. However, their inherently sequential nature makes them difficult to parallelize on modern hardware, often leading to slower training times despite their theoretical efficiency. More recent architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) have shown great promise in achieving linear-time performance. 1 Models like Mamba [4], in particular, have demonstrated strong performance by using selection mechanism and hardware-aware parallel scan algorithm. While these models are highly effective, they reintroduce form of recurrence into their design. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network. GAM is designed from the ground up to satisfy two critical criteria: (1) linear computational complexity and (2) maximum parallelizability on modern accelerators by avoiding recurrence entirely. It replaces the self-attention block with novel GAMBlock that combines two complementary context-modeling pathways: 1. Local Context Pathway: 1D causal convolution efficiently captures local syntactic and positional relationships. 2. Global Context Pathway: parallel associative memory retrieves global, contentbased patterns from learned memory bank for all tokens simultaneously. These pathways are fused with learnable gating mechanism, enabling the network to dynamically allocate resources to local or global context as needed. Our contributions are: We propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) architecture, novel O(N ) sequence model that is fully parallelizable and non-recurrent. We provide complete implementation and empirically demonstrate that GAM consistently trains faster than both comparable Transformer and Mamba on standard GPU. We show through experiments on the WikiText-2 and TinyStories datasets that GAM achieves better perplexity than well-trained Transformer baseline and the Mamba baseline, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability.The quest for efficient sequence modeling beyond the standard Transformer has been vibrant area of research. Our work is situated within this landscape and draws inspiration from several key ideas. Efficient Transformers large body of work, surveyed by Tay et al. [10], focuses on approximating the dense attention matrix. These methods can be broadly categorized: Sparsity-based Methods: Models like Longformer [1] use combination of local windowed attention and sparse global attention to reduce computation, allowing them to process thousands of tokens. Low-Rank Methods: Linformer [12] is based on the observation that the self-attention matrix is often low-rank and can be approximated by projecting the Key and Value matrices to lower-dimensional space, reducing complexity from O(N 2) to O(N ). Kernel-based Methods: Performers [2] use random feature maps to approximate the softmax kernel, enabling linear-time attention mechanism without direct computation of the matrix. While effective, these approaches primarily modify the self-attention mechanism itself. GAM, in contrast, replaces it entirely with different inductive bias. 2 Recurrent Models and State Space Models (SSMs) Before Transformers, RNNs, and particularly LSTMs [6], were the dominant paradigm for sequence modeling. Their O(N ) complexity is key advantage, but their sequential nature limits training parallelism. Recently, there has been resurgence of interest in models that combine recurrence with modern hardwareaware designs. Structured State Space Models (S4) [5] and Mamba [4] are prominent examples that achieve linear-time scaling and strong performance by drawing on principles fro"

Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network offers a linear complexity alternative to the Transformer architecture, improving training speed and achieving competitive validation perplexity.  					AI-generated summary 				 The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism, has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)), creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper, we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local, position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2 benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both baselines on training speed, and achieves a superior or competitive final validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as a promising and efficient alternative for sequence modeling.

Modern LLMs exhibit less prompt sensitivity than previously thought, with much of the reported variability due to heuristic evaluation methods rather than inherent model weaknesses.  					AI-generated summary 				 Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e., repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family) across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12 diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.
