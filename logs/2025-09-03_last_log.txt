Text:"5 2 0 2 1 ] . [ 1 0 4 4 1 0 . 9 0 5 2 : r a Andrei Semenov EPFL andrii.semenov@epfl.ch Matteo Pagliardini EPFL matteo.pagliardini@epfl.ch Martin Jaggi EPFL martin.jaggi@epfl.ch https://github.com/epfml/llm-optimizer-benchmark Abstract The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been accompanied by an effervescence of novel ideas and methods to better optimize the loss of deep learning models. Claims from those methods are myriad: from faster convergence to removing reliance on certain hyperparameters. However, the diverse experimental protocols used to validate these claims make direct comparisons between methods challenging. This study presents comprehensive evaluation of recent optimization techniques across standardized LLM pretraining scenarios, systematically varying model size, batch size, and training duration. Through careful tuning of each method, we provide guidance to practitioners on which optimizer is best suited for each scenario. For researchers, our work highlights promising directions for future optimization research. Finally, by releasing our code and making all experiments fully reproducible, we hope our efforts can help the development and rigorous benchmarking of future methods. Over the past five years, Large Language Models (LLMs) [24, 95, 40, 82] have shown growth in performance and size, demonstrating proficiency in various downstream tasks [128, 13, 145]. The success of LLM pretraining hinges on three key pillars: high-quality data [102, 77], architectural innovations [57, 24], and scalable optimization techniques [56, 122, 16]. Among these, the choice of optimizer has remained notably consistent in recent years, with Adam(W) [66, 84] dominating deep learning for nearly decade. However, recent advances [59, 81, 141, 99, 104, 36, 27] challenge this status quo, offering alternatives that surpass AdamW in speed, communication efficiency [1] or final downstream performance on various benchmarks [20, 64], particularly for autoregr"

A comprehensive evaluation of recent optimization techniques for Large Language Models provides guidance on selecting the best optimizer for different pretraining scenarios.  					AI-generated summary 				 The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been accompanied by an effervescence of novel ideas and methods to better optimize the loss of deep learning models. Claims from those methods are myriad: from faster convergence to removing reliance on certain hyperparameters. However, the diverse experimental protocols used to validate these claims make direct comparisons between methods challenging. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of recent optimization techniques across standardized LLM pretraining scenarios, systematically varying model size, batch size, and training duration. Through careful tuning of each method, we provide guidance to practitioners on which optimizer is best suited for each scenario. For researchers, our work highlights promising directions for future optimization research. Finally, by releasing our code and making all experiments fully reproducible, we hope our efforts can help the development and rigorous benchmarking of future methods.

Camlang, a constructed language, is used to evaluate whether LLMs can master unfamiliar languages through metalinguistic reasoning, revealing that current models lack systematic grammatical mastery compared to humans.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup, and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang, creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human metalinguistic competence.

MobiAgent, a comprehensive mobile agent system, achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world mobile scenarios through its MobiMind-series models, AgentRR framework, and MobiFlow benchmarking suite, while also reducing data annotation costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 With the rapid advancement of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), GUI-based mobile agents have emerged as a key development direction for intelligent mobile systems. However, existing agent models continue to face significant challenges in real-world task execution, particularly in terms of accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MobiAgent, a comprehensive mobile agent system comprising three core components: the MobiMind-series agent models, the AgentRR acceleration framework, and the MobiFlow benchmarking suite. Furthermore, recognizing that the capabilities of current mobile agents are still limited by the availability of high-quality data, we have developed an AI-assisted agile data collection pipeline that significantly reduces the cost of manual annotation. Compared to both general-purpose LLMs and specialized GUI agent models, MobiAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world mobile scenarios.

ViSTA-SLAM is a real-time monocular SLAM system that uses a lightweight STA model for pose estimation and pointmap regression, and a Sim(3) pose graph for drift correction, achieving superior tracking and reconstruction.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly, the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current methods.
