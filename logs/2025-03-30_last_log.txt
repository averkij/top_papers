Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first attempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for eliciting video reasoning within multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-COT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 35.8% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o. All codes, models, data are released.

这篇文章介绍了一种名为Video-R1的新方法，用于在多模态大语言模型中激发视频推理能力。受DeepSeek-R1成功的启发，作者提出了T-GRPO算法，以解决直接应用RL训练中的时间建模和高质量数据缺乏的问题。他们还创建了两个包含图像和视频数据的数据集，并展示了Video-R1在多个视频推理基准上的显著改进。特别是，Video-R1-7B在VSI-bench上的准确率达到了35.8%，超越了商业模型GPT-4o。所有代码、模型和数据都已公开。
