INTRODUCTION ISION-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP [1], ALIGN [2], Flamingo [3], and LLaVA [4] have attracted considerable attention from both academia and industry due to their powerful cross-modal reasoning capabilities. These models learn joint image-text representations from large-scale datasets [5] and have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance and generalization across variety of tasks. VLMs have been successfully applied in diverse domains, including autonomous driving [6], robotics [7], anomaly detection [8], and cross-modal retrieval [9]. However, because the pre-training phase cannot capture the full diversity of downstream tasks and environments, adapting VLMs to specific applications remains fundamental challenge. Early efforts primarily relied on supervised finetuning [10][13], which explores more knowledge in annotated Equal contribution. Corresponding author. H. Dong and E.

Despite their effectiveness, they still suffer from high annotation costs and performance degradation under distribution shifts [14] between training and test data. To address these limitations, growing body of work has explored unsupervised adaptation techniques [15][20]. These approachesoften referred to as zero-shot inference [21] [23], test-time methods [18], [24], [25], or unsupervised tuning [17], [26], [27]aim to improve VLMs performance in downstream tasks without relying on costly annotation. Such methods have proven effective across wide range of applications, including image classification [15], [17], [18], segmentation [16], [28], [29], medical image diagnosis [30], [31], and action recognition [32], [33]. Given the rapid growth of this research area, this survey provides comprehensive and structured overview of existing unsupervised adaptation methods for VLMs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce taxonomy centered on the availability of unlabeled visual dataan often overlooked yet practically critical factor in real-world deployment. As illustrated in Fig. 1, we categorize existing approaches into four paradigms: (1) Data-Free Transfer [15], [16], [21], which adapts models using only textual class names; (2) Unsupervised Domain Transfer [17], [34], [35], which utilizes abundant unlabeled data from the downstream tasks; (3) Episodic Test-Time Adaptation [18], [24], [36], which adapts models to batch of test instances; and (4) Online Test-Time Adaptation [19], [23], [25], which addresses the challenge of streaming test data. This taxonomy provides principled framework for understanding the landscape of unsupervised VLM adaptation, guiding practitioners in selecting suitable techniques. We also believe our taxonomy will facilitate fair comparisons across future work within the same paradigm. The organization of this survey follows the structure shown in Fig. 2. Sec. II provides an overview of several research topics related to unsupervised learning in the context of VLMs. Sec. III introduces zero-shot inference with VLMs and presents comprehensive taxonomy based on the availability of unlabeled visual data. The central focus of this survey is discussed in Sec. IV - Sec. VII, where we analyze existing approaches within data-free transfer, unsupervised domain transfer, episodic test-time adaptation, and online testtime adaptation, respectively. Sec. VIII explores variety of application scenarios that utilize unsupervised techniques and introduces related benchmarks, offering broader perspective on their practical implications and real-world utility. Finally, we summarize emerging trends in the field and identify key scientific questions that could inspire future work in Sec. IX. Comparison with previous surveys.

"A comprehensive survey of unsupervised adaptation methods for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) categorizes approaches based on the availability of unlabeled visual data and discusses methodologies, benchmarks, and future research directions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data), and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field. Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research. An actively maintained repository of relevant literature is available at https://github.com/tim-learn/Awesome-LabelFree-VLMs."

UI-AGILE enhances GUI agents through improved training with a Continuous Reward function, Simple Thinking reward, and Cropping-based Resampling, and inference with Decomposed Grounding with Selection, achieving state-of-the-art performance on GUI benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities. Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training, we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process: 1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a "Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy; and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

MeshLLM uses large language models to generate and understand text-serialized 3D meshes by decomposing them into meaningful subunits and training with local mesh assembly strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present MeshLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to understand and generate text-serialized 3D meshes. Our approach addresses key limitations in existing methods, including the limited dataset scale when catering to LLMs' token length and the loss of 3D structural information during mesh serialization. We introduce a Primitive-Mesh decomposition strategy, which divides 3D meshes into structurally meaningful subunits. This enables the creation of a large-scale dataset with 1500k+ samples, almost 50 times larger than previous methods, which aligns better with the LLM scaling law principles. Furthermore, we propose inferring face connectivity from vertices and local mesh assembly training strategies, significantly enhancing the LLMs' ability to capture mesh topology and spatial structures. Experiments show that MeshLLM outperforms the state-of-the-art LLaMA-Mesh in both mesh generation quality and shape understanding, highlighting its great potential in processing text-serialized 3D meshes.
