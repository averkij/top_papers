[30.10.2025 03:39] Abstract 8. Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for real-world use during inference.

A unified multimodal code corpus and model, JanusCoder, generate code from text and visual inputs, outperforming commercial models in various coding tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However, progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data, a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions, visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models. Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

"A unified multimodal code corpus and model, JanusCoder, generate code from text and visual inputs, outperforming commercial models in various coding tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However, progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data, a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions, visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models. Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder."

Practical deployment of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) demands strong test-time performance, motivating methods that guide inference-time search and selectively spend compute to improve quality. We present the Multi-Agent System Process Reward Model (MASPRM). It assigns per-action, per-agent values to partial inter-agent transcripts and acts as an inference-time controller. MASPRM is trained from multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts without requiring step-level human annotations, by propagating returns to local targets. At inference, MASPRM guides step-level beam search and MCTS, focusing computation on promising branches and pruning early. On GSM8K and MATH, MASPRM-guided decoding with an outcome reward model (ORM) applied to the final answer, improves exact match (EM) over a single straight-through MAS pass by +30.7 and +22.9 points, respectively. A MASPRM trained on GSM8K transfers zero-shot to MATH without retraining, adding 8.4 EM points at the same budget. MASPRM is a plug-in value model that estimates per-agent progress and complements verifier-style decoders, enabling more reliable, compute-aware multi-agent reasoning.

Recent advances in text-only large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate remarkable reasoning ability. However, these models remain fragile or entirely incapable when extended to multi-modal tasks. Existing approaches largely rely on single-form captions, which lack diversity and often fail to adapt across different types of Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. As a result, they provide no principled or efficient channel for transmitting fine-grained visual information. We introduce Seeing Eye, a modular framework that unlocks multimodal reasoning in text-only LLMs through an agent-based small VLM translator. This translator acts as a perception agent: it can invoke specialized tools (e.g., OCR and crop) and iteratively distill multimodal inputs into structured intermediate representations (SIRs) tailored to the question. These SIRs are then passed to the text-only LLM, which serves as a reasoning agent. Crucially, the translator and reasoner engage in multi-round feedback and interaction, enabling the extraction of targeted visual details and yielding more confident answers. Experiments on knowledge-intensive VQA benchmarks, including MMMU and MIA-Bench, demonstrate that Seeing Eye not only reduces inference cost but also surpasses much larger end-to-end VLMs. For example, an instantiation combining a 3B-parameter vision translator with an 8B-parameter language reasoner outperforms a monolithic 32B VLM on challenging knowledge-based questions. Our results highlight that decoupling perception from reasoning via agent information flow offers a scalable and plug-and-play pathway to multimodal reasoning, allowing strong text-only LLMs to fully leverage their reasoning capabilities.
