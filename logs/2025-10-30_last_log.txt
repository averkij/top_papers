Existing methods primarily focus on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are really crucial for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing methods usually leverage training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, novel synthetic data generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks. Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally, the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the performa"

We present and open-source Ouro, named after the recursive Ouroboros, family of pre-trained Looped Language Models (LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i) iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and 2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA LLMs across wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results show the potential of LoopLM as novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

Text:"5 2 0 2 8 2 ] . [ 1 4 2 8 4 2 . 0 1 5 2 : r Parallel Loop Transformer for Efficient Test-Time Computation ScalingLarge Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However, this approach has major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop. This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is new architecture that delivers the performance benefits of deep, looped model but with the low latency of standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques. First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache) from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses Gated Sliding-Window Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves the high accuracy of traditional looped model but with almost no extra latency or memory cost compared to standard transformer. Date: October 30, 2025 Correspondence: Bohong Wu at bohongwu@bytedance.com, Xingyan Bin at binxingyan@bytedance.comLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across wide range of tasks [21, 26, 28, 29, 38, 39], yet their practical deployment is often constrained by substantial computational costs during inference [4, 5, 24, 45, 49]. As models scale, the latency and memory bandwidth required for token generation become significant bottlenecks. This challenge has spurred research into architectures that can achieve high performance while maintaining inference efficiency. One promising direction is the use of looped transformers, such as the Universal Transformer [11], which reuses the same set of parameters across multiple computational steps or "loops." This weight-sharing mechanism makes them highly parameter-efficient, enabling them to achieve greater effective depth and stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks without increasing the models storage footprint [13, 16, 30, 32, 35, 37, 43, 46]. However, this parameter efficiency comes at severe cost: in their vanilla implementation, the loops are executed in strictly sequential manner as shown in Figure 1a. Such sequential dependency means that per-token compute, wall-clock latency, and KV-cache size all scale linearly, O(L), with the number of loops (L). This scaling bottleneck renders vanilla looped transformers impractical for latency-sensitive 1 (a) Inference pipeline in vanilla loop transformer (b) Inference pipeline in proposed PLT . Figure 1 Illustration of the computation flow. (a) Vanilla loop transformer, where each loop in each token should be computed in serial manner. (b) Parallel loop transformer (PLT), where transformer loops within the same blue dashed box can be computed in parallel. applications, effectively negating their primary advantages. To resolve this tension between effective depth and inference speed, we introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is novel architecture designed to unlock the performance benefits of deep, looped computation while maintaining the approximate inference latency of standard, non-looped transformer. As shown in Figure 1b, the core principle of PLT is to break the sequential loop dependency by parallelizing the computation of different loops across different tokens. Our approach consists of two key components. First, we introduce Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP), technique that reformulates the training and inference pipelines. During decoding, CLP executes the l-th loop for the current token ti concurrently with the (l + 1)-th loop for the previous token ti1 and so on, all within single forward pass. This overlapping computation effectively collapses the sequential steps into one, decoupling the models effective depth from its wall-clock latency. Second, to address the O(L) growth in KV cache, we propose an Efficient Representation Enhancement strategy. This strategy shares the KV cache from the first loop with all subsequent loops, reducing the KV cache memory footprint back to the level of Loop times as 1. To preserve high accuracy, we augment this global shared representation with local context mechanism, using gated sliding-window attention (SWA) in non-first loops. Our contributions are as follows: We propose the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT), an architecture that, to our knowledge, is the first to successfully parallelize the computation of looped transformers to achieve scalable test-time computation with negligible latency overhead. We introduce Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) and an Efficient Representation Enhancement technique (KV-cache sharing with gated SWA) to overcome the critical latency and memory bottlenecks of traditional looped models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on both in-house and open-source models that PLT significantly outperforms vanilla transformer baselines in accuracy while adding minimal latency. We show that PLT is far more efficient than vanilla looped transformers, and can even enable shallower, more efficient PLT model (e.g., 1.7B activated parameters) to achieve superior performance and lower latency than much larger vanilla model (e.g., 2.5B activated parameters).2 Figure 2 Training and inference pipeline of PLT with loop count L=3. Training (Left): Same Colored boxes trace how input tokens traverse the loops to predict their targets (e.g., token T1 passes three loops to predict T4, consistent with Figure 1b). Training is parallel along the token dimension and serial along the loop dimension. Inference (Right): Parallelized forward pass of PLT when decoding T4 and T5 in Loop Transformer with L=3. Because there are no horizontal (same-step, cross-loop) activation dependencies during training, computations within the same step (each row; see the blue dashed box) run in parallel during decoding."

All code, benchmarks, and resources are publicly available to support open research: https://bharatgen-iitb-tih.github.io/bhashabenchv1/ Date: October 30, 2025 Correspondence: Kundeshwar.pundalik@tihiitb.orgThe rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed artificial intelligence, extending their capabilities far beyond traditional natural language processing. Models such as GPT-4o [49], GPT-OSS-120B [52], DeepSeek-V3 [19], and Qwen-3 [72] excel across diverse domains, from code generation and mathematical reasoning to creative writing and scientific analysis [15, 63, 51], enabling applications in conversational AI, education, healthcare, finance, legal services, and agriculture [16, 68]. Platforms like Krishi Sathi [64] leverage LLMs for crop advisory and pest detection, improving agricultural productivity. Despite these advances, substantial performance gaps remain in multilingual and domain-specific contexts, particularly for non-Latin, low-resource languages [65, 77, 1]. Englishcentric training limits models ability to capture nuanced knowledge in specialized fields and India-specific domains, such as Ayurveda, indigenous agriculture, finance, and regional legal systems [69, 58, 35], highlighting the need for culturally and contextually aware evaluation. The scale of this problem demands urgent attention, as Indias diverse knowledge ecosystem affects millions of lives across multiple critical domains. In agriculture alone, Over 40 million farmers rely on farming-related activities [28], and access to accurate information on crop management, soil health, and sustainable practices can have direct impact on food security and livelihoods. The complexity is further magnified by the fact that each state in India has its own distinct agricultural methods, crop varieties, soil conditions, and traditional farming practices that have evolved over centuries to suit local climatic and geographical conditions. Similarly, Indias legal system processes millions of cases annually, requiring precise understanding of complex legal frameworks, precedents, and procedural nuances that vary across states and jurisdictions [44]. The healthcare sector, particularly 1 Figure 1 Overview diagram and statistics of BhashaBench V1. traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda, serves millions of patients who rely on practitioners knowledge of ancient texts, formulations, and treatment protocols. Furthermore, Indias financial ecosystem processes billions of transactions daily, including over 100 billion UPI transactions annually, where even minor misunderstandings in financial regulations or procedures can have cascading effects [45]. While existing benchmarks such as MMLU [26], HellaSwag [75], AGIEVAL [78], and more recent multilingual efforts like MEGA [1] attempt to assess model capabilities, they often focus primarily on English content and may not fully capture India-specific nuances, cultural contexts, and domain expertise that are essential for real-world applications in the Indian subcontinent. To address these critical gaps, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first comprehensive domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating large language models on India-centric knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 encompasses four fundamental domains that form the backbone of Indian society and economy: Agriculture (BBK - BhashaBench Krishi), Legal (BBL - BhashaBench Legal), Finance (BBF - BhashaBench Finance), and Ayurveda (BBA - BhashaBench Ayurveda). The benchmark spans over 90 subdomains and covers more than 500 specific topics, reflecting the intricate complexity and diversity of Indian knowledge systems. This granular categorization enables fine-grained evaluation of model performance across specialized areas that require deep domain expertise and cultural understanding. The dataset has been meticulously curated from over 40 authentic government and professional examination papers, ensuring that the questions reflect real-world scenarios and ground-level challenges faced by practitioners in these domains [29, 79]. To maximize coverage across Indias linguistic landscape, BhashaBench V1 currently supports English and Hindi, the two most widely understood languages in the country, collectively enabling assessment of models capabilities for significant portion of Indias population while maintaining the cultural and contextual authenticity of the original knowledge systems. Our comprehensive evaluation of 29+ state-of-the-art language models on BhashaBench V1 reveals significant performance disparities across domains"

Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604 tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

Dream4Drive is a synthetic data generation framework that enhances downstream perception tasks in autonomous driving by decomposing videos into 3D-aware guidance maps and rendering 3D assets, leading to improved performance across various training epochs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are really crucial for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks. Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally, the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception models.

Video-Thinker, a multimodal large language model, autonomously reasons with videos using intrinsic grounding and captioning capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various video reasoning benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker, which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability. Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image, while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions, we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas. For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation, we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache. Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

ReForm, a reflective autoformalization method, improves the semantic accuracy of formal statements generated from natural language mathematics through iterative refinement and semantic consistency evaluation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into machine-verifiable formal statements, is critical for using formal mathematical reasoning to solve math problems stated in natural language. While Large Language Models can generate syntactically correct formal statements, they often fail to preserve the original problem's semantic intent. This limitation arises from the LLM approaches' treating autoformalization as a simplistic translation task which lacks mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative refinement that human experts naturally employ. To address these issues, we propose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This enables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its semantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive refinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different rewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing superficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive experiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm achieves an average improvement of 17.2 percentage points over the strongest baselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only validates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently difficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.

Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media, yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task, enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a comprehensive dataset to the community.

Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation, such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models (LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i) iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and 2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era. Our model could be found in: http://ouro-llm.github.io.

"Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation, such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models (LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i) iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and 2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era. Our model could be found in: http://ouro-llm.github.io."

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However, this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop. This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques. First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache) from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

We propose Ming-Flash-Omni, an upgraded version of Ming-Omni, built upon a sparser Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variant of Ling-Flash-2.0 with 100 billion total parameters, of which only 6.1 billion are active per token. This architecture enables highly efficient scaling (dramatically improving computational efficiency while significantly expanding model capacity) and empowers stronger unified multimodal intelligence across vision, speech, and language, representing a key step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Compared to its predecessor, the upgraded version exhibits substantial improvements across multimodal understanding and generation. We significantly advance speech recognition capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in contextual ASR and highly competitive results in dialect-aware ASR. In image generation, Ming-Flash-Omni introduces high-fidelity text rendering and demonstrates marked gains in scene consistency and identity preservation during image editing. Furthermore, Ming-Flash-Omni introduces generative segmentation, a capability that not only achieves strong standalone segmentation performance but also enhances spatial control in image generation and improves editing consistency. Notably, Ming-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art results in text-to-image generation and generative segmentation, and sets new records on all 12 contextual ASR benchmarks, all within a single unified architecture.

Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity. Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods, especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.

"Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity. Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods, especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/."

The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains: Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law, International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science, and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are publicly available to support open research.
