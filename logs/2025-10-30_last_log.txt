[30.10.2025 08:16] Abstract 4.

[30.10.2025 08:16] Abstract 6. Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread attention.

[30.10.2025 08:16] Abstract 7. Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media, yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI.

[30.10.2025 08:16] Abstract 11. Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However, this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, caus...
