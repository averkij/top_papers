[ 1 2 8 6 5 2 . 0 1 5 2 : r PairUni: Pairwise Training for Unified Multimodal Language Models Jiani Zheng, Zhiyang Teng, Xiangtai Li, Anran Wang, Yu Tian, Kunpeng Qiu, Ye Tian, Haochen Wang, Zhuochen WangUnified Vision-Language Models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and generation within single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement learning (RL). We propose PairUni, unified framework that reorganizes data into understandinggeneration (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly. We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples, forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation sample, we retrieve semantically related understanding example to form retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, pair-aware variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns similarity score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate high-quality dataset of 16K UG pairs named as PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on the powerful JanusPro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLMs RL baselines. Code: https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/PairUni Date: October 30, 2025 Correspondence: zhengjiani.0123@bytedance.com, zhiyang.teng@bytedance.com,Unified visionlanguage models (UVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in both multimodal understanding and image generation across variety of recent systems and backbones [3, 8, 25, 40]. However, as evaluation steadily shifts toward complex, multi-step reasoningcovering mathematics, science, and multi-hop visual question answeringthe goal of training single system that balances these two capabilities under unified learning paradigm remains non-trivial [5, 20, 24, 53]. This challenge is particularly acute when using reinforcement learning (RL), since understanding and generation are supervised with heterogeneous objectives and data formats, making the optimization process highly sensitive to data batching and cross-task credit assignment. This fundamental disparity has largely led to siloed advancements. For instance, text-to-image RL has focused on improving object controllability and prompt adherence [13, 30], while visual reasoning improvements have separately targeted accuracy on benchmarks for math or science. Consequently, attempts at unified RL encounter significant practical obstacles: (i) task interference during joint optimization, where gains on one 1 objective cause regressions on the other [14]; (ii) broad and diverse understanding task space (e.g., math, charts, OCR) that resists single reward design; and (iii) limited guidance on how to select and align data for unified RL at scale, constraining both stability and ceiling performance [12]. Prevailing GRPO-based strategies often sidestep the central issue by focusing on single capability, such as using understanding signals to improve generation quality [13], or by adopting multi-stage schemes that alternate between tasks to find fragile balance [14]. While effective to degree, these methods do not directly tackle the core source of conflict: the lack of data-level semantic alignment between understanding and generation supervision and the absence of an optimization rule that respects this alignment. As result, the shared policy is driven by competing gradients from unrelated signals, leading to unstable updates and uneven performance gains across tasks. This optimization-level conflict is not merely theoretical; it is empirically measurable and provides the direct motivation for our work. simple empirical regularity further motivates this study. When the data fed to understanding and generation are semantically aligned, the cosine similarity between their gradients, cos(cid:0)θLU , θLG (cid:1), increases, and higher gradient agreement correlates with stronger downstream results on MMMU, MMStar, and GenEval [5, 10, 53]. In contrast, randomly mixed or weakly matched samples reduce gradient agreement and hinder both objectives. This points to dataoptimization mismatch in unified RL: understanding and generation rely on heterogeneous supervision and data formats, and updating shared policy without respecting semantic correspondence drives the model in conflicting directions, particularly in Janus-style architectures with shared LLM [6]. The working hypothesis is that data alignment, rather than dataset size alone, is key lever for balancing objectives, and that credit assignment should reflect the strength of that alignment. We address this with PairUni, unified RL framework that aligns the problem at both the data and optimization levels. On the data side, we reorganize heterogeneous supervision into understandinggeneration (UG) pairs centered on the same or closely related images. Two complementary pair types are constructed. Aligned pairs are formed by completing single-task samples into unified quadruples, using GPT-o3 to add the missing caption or prompt for understanding data or to synthesize questionanswer pair for generation data, so that both objectives share the same instance. We use clustering to select representative high-quality medoids from the unified quadruples. Retrieved pairs link generation sample to semantically related understanding sample via similarity search over image embeddings, which expands coverage when exact matches are scarce. This paired view exposes cross-task correspondences, namely what to attend to for understanding and how to express it for generation, on related content rather than on unrelated batches. On the optimization side, we develop Pair-GRPO, pair-aware variant of GRPO that modulates the advantage by pair similarity. Aligned pairs receive full weight, and retrieved pairs are down-weighted by their pair-similarity scores. This mechanism strengthens updates from high-quality supervision and tempers weaker matches, which reduces cross-task interference while preserving GRPO stability through the clipped objective and KL regularization. In effect, the policy update is made to respect the"

Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly. We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples, forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines.

Главная проблема заключается в том, что эти две задачи требуют разнородных данных, что затрудняет их балансировку при reinforcement learning. Авторы предлагают реорганизовать данные в пары «понимание-генерация»: для изображений с разметкой генерируют описания, а для изображений с описаниями создают вопросы-ответы с помощью GPT-o3. Новый метод Pair-GPRO использует оценку схожести пар для модуляции обучения, усиливая сигнал от хорошо согласованных примеров и достигая сбалансированного улучшения на обеих задачах.",
