Text:"Revisiting the Platonic Representation Hypothesis: An Aristotelian View Fabian Groger * 1 2 3 Shuo Wen * 1 Maria Brbic 1 6 2 0 2 6 1 ] . [ 1 6 8 4 4 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r aThe Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that representations from neural networks are converging to common statistical model of reality. We show that the existing metrics used to measure representational similarity are confounded by network scale: increasing model depth or width can systematically inflate representational similarity scores. To correct these effects, we introduce permutation-based null-calibration framework that transforms any representational similarity metric into calibrated score with statistical guarantees. We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities. Based on these findings, we propose the Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis: representations in neural networks are converging to shared local neighborhood relationships. 1. Introduction Quantifying the similarity between neural network representations is central to understanding the geometry of learned representation spaces (Raghu et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2021), guiding transfer learning decisions (Kornblith et al., 2019; Neyshabur et al., 2020), and relating artificial representations to neural measurements in neuroscience (Schrimpf et al., 2018). The Platonic Representation Hypothesis (Huh et al., 2024) posits that as neural networks scale, representations across different modalities become increasingly similar, suggesting convergence to shared statistical model of reality. This hypothesis has motivated growing literature that uses representational similarity to Project Page: brbiclab.epfl.ch/aristotelian Code: github.com/mlbio-epfl/aristotelian *Equal contribution 1EPFL 2University of Basel 3HSLU. Correspondence to: Maria Brbic <maria.brbic@epfl.ch>. The Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis Neural networks, trained with different objectives on different data and modalities, are converging to shared local neighborhood relationships. Figure 1. The Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis: Local relations (who is near whom), rather than distances between data points, are preserved across different representation spaces. Representation learning algorithms will converge to shared local neighborhood relationships. study whether scaling produces universal structure across models (Huh et al., 2024; Maniparambil et al., 2024; Tjandrasuwita et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2026). To measure representational similarity across models, different metrics have been proposed, such as Centered Kernel Alignment (Kornblith et al., 2019), Canonical Correlation Analysis (Weenink, 2003), Representational Similarity Analysis (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008), and mutual k-Nearest Neighbors (Huh et al., 2024). In this work, we identify two pervasive confounders that distort representational similarity measurements. The first is the model width: when the embedding dimension increases relative to the sample size, interaction-matrix-based similarity metrics exhibit systematic positive baseline even when representations are independent. This spurious similarity is general consequence of dimensionality-driven null inflation: the expected similarity under independence does not vanish but instead depends on both the representation dimensionality and the sample size (Figure 2a). As result, wider models can appear more aligned simply because their representations live in higher-dimensional spaces. The second confounder is the model depth. Many analyses do not compare individual layer pairs, because it is unknown where similarity arises (Schrimpf et al., 2018; Huh et al., 1 Revisiting the Platonic Representation Hypothesis: An Aristotelian View resentation Hypothesis still hold once similarity is calibrated? We find that, after calibration, the previously reported convergence in global metrics (Huh et al., 2024; Maniparambil et al., 2024; Tjandrasuwita et al., 2025) largely disappears, suggesting it was driven primarily by width and depth confounders, whereas local neighborhood-based metrics retain significant cross-modal alignment (Figure 2c). However, we also observe that the convergence in local distances is not preserved, suggesting that only local neighborhood relationships are aligned. Motivated by these results, we refine the original Platonic Representation Hypothesis and propose the Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis1: Neural networks, trained with different objectives on different data and modalities, converge to shared local neighborhood relationships (Figure 1). We name it after the Greek philosopher Aristotle, who was student of Plato and, in his Categories, established the principles of relatives (Aristotle, ca. 350 B.C.E). 2. Related work Representational similarity metrics. long line of work compares representation spaces using variety of similarity measures. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) (Hotelling, 1992) and variants such as Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA) (Raghu et al., 2017) and Projection Weighted Canonical Correlation Analysis (PWCCA) (Morcos et al., 2018) compare subspaces up to linear transformations, while Procrustesand shape-based distances compare representations up to restricted alignment classes (Ding et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2021). Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) (Kornblith et al., 2019) has become dominant tool for comparing deep representations, with kernelized variants extending to nonlinear similarity. Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008), originating in neuroscience, compares representational dissimilarity matrices rather than feature bases. Neighborhood-based approaches, such as mutual k-Nearest Neighbors (mKNN) (Huh et al., 2024), capture local topological consistency rather than global alignment. However, recent evaluations stress that different metrics encode different invariances and can yield qualitatively different conclusions, motivating more robust reporting practices (Klabunde et al., 2025; Ding et al., 2021; Harvey et al., 2024; Bo et al., 2024).

[ 1 8 7 9 2 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r AbstractAction chunking enables Vision Language Action (VLA) models to run in real time, but naive chunked execution often exhibits discontinuities at chunk boundaries. Real-Time Chunking (RTC) alleviates this issue but is external to the policy, leading to spurious multimodal switching and trajectories that are not intrinsically smooth. We propose Legato, trainingtime continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies. Specifically, Legato initializes denoising from scheduleshaped mixture of known actions and noise, exposing the model to partial action information. Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time. Extensive real-world experiments show that Legato consistently outperforms RTC across five manipulation tasks, achieving approximately 10% improvements in both trajectory smoothness and task completion time. I. INTRODUCTION Action chunking [20] has become widely adopted strategy for deploying large Vision Language Action (VLA) models in real-world robotic systems [7, 19, 3743, 46].

Text:"February 18, 2026 6 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 7 2 3 5 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r a Hanlin Zhang1, Jikai Jin2, Vasilis Syrgkanis2, and Sham Kakade1 1Harvard University 2Stanford University Abstract For deploying foundation models, practitioners increasingly need prescriptive scaling laws: given pretraining compute budget, what downstream accuracy is attainable with contemporary post-training practice, and how stable is that mapping as the field evolves? Using large-scale observational evaluations with 5k observational and 2k newly sampled data on model performance, we estimate capability boundarieshigh conditional quantiles of benchmark scores as function of log pre-training FLOPs, via smoothed quantile regression with monotone, saturating sigmoid parameterization. We validate the temporal reliability by fitting on earlier model generations and evaluating on later releases. Across various tasks, the estimated boundaries are mostly stable, with the exception of math reasoning that exhibits consistently advancing boundary over time. We then extend our approach to analyze task-dependent saturation and to probe contamination-related shifts on math reasoning tasks. Finally, we introduce an efficient algorithm that recovers near-full-data frontiers using roughly 20% of evaluation budget. Together, our work releases the Proteus-2k, the latest model performance evaluation dataset, and introduces practical methodology for translating compute budgets into reliable performance expectations and for monitoring when capability boundaries shift across time. (cid:18) Blog ı Datasets Code Over the past several years, language model (LM) scaling has emerged as one of the most robust empirical laws in modern machine learning (Hestness et al., 2017). Across model families and training regimes, increasing pre-training compute has been shown to produce smooth and predictable improvements in loss, perplexity, and, to lesser extent, downstream task performance (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Gadr"

The Reason-Reflect-Refine framework addresses the trade-off between generation and understanding in multimodal models by reformulating single-step generation into a multi-step process that explicitly incorporates understanding during generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current research in multimodal models faces a key challenge where enhancing generative capabilities often comes at the expense of understanding, and vice versa. We analyzed this trade-off and identify the primary cause might be the potential conflict between generation and understanding, which creates a competitive dynamic within the model. To address this, we propose the Reason-Reflect-Refine (R3) framework. This innovative algorithm re-frames the single-step generation task into a multi-step process of "generate-understand-regenerate". By explicitly leveraging the model's understanding capability during generation, we successfully mitigate the optimization dilemma, achieved stronger generation results and improved understanding ability which are related to the generation process. This offers valuable insights for designing next-generation unified multimodal models. Code is available at https://github.com/sen-ye/R3.

Network representations converge toward shared local neighborhood relationships rather than global statistical models, as revealed by calibrated similarity metrics.  					AI-generated summary 				 The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that representations from neural networks are converging to a common statistical model of reality. We show that the existing metrics used to measure representational similarity are confounded by network scale: increasing model depth or width can systematically inflate representational similarity scores. To correct these effects, we introduce a permutation-based null-calibration framework that transforms any representational similarity metric into a calibrated score with statistical guarantees. We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities. Based on these findings, we propose the Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis: representations in neural networks are converging to shared local neighborhood relationships.

A two-stage framework addresses alignment of large language models with clinician preferences through physician-verified examples and distilled clinical principles for improved medical reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate expert-level medical knowledge, aligning their open-ended outputs with fine-grained clinician preferences remains challenging. Existing methods often rely on coarse objectives or unreliable automated judges that are weakly grounded in professional guidelines. We propose a two-stage framework to address this gap. First, we introduce HealthRubrics, a dataset of 7,034 physician-verified preference examples in which clinicians refine LLM-drafted rubrics to meet rigorous medical standards. Second, we distill these rubrics into HealthPrinciples: 119 broadly reusable, clinically grounded principles organized by clinical dimensions, enabling scalable supervision beyond manual annotation. We use HealthPrinciples for (1) offline alignment by synthesizing rubrics for unlabeled queries and (2) an inference-time tool for guided self-revision. A 30B parameter model that activates only 3B parameters at inference trained with our framework achieves 33.4% on HealthBench-Hard, outperforming much larger models including Deepseek-R1 and o3, establishing a resource-efficient baseline for clinical alignment.

Legato improves action-chunked Vision Language Action models by using training-time continuation methods that ensure smooth trajectories and reduce multimodal switching during real-time execution.  					AI-generated summary 				 Action chunking enables Vision Language Action (VLA) models to run in real time, but naive chunked execution often exhibits discontinuities at chunk boundaries. Real-Time Chunking (RTC) alleviates this issue but is external to the policy, leading to spurious multimodal switching and trajectories that are not intrinsically smooth. We propose Legato, a training-time continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies. Specifically, Legato initializes denoising from a schedule-shaped mixture of known actions and noise, exposing the model to partial action information. Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time. Extensive real-world experiments show that Legato consistently outperforms RTC across five manipulation tasks, achieving approximately 10% improvements in both trajectory smoothness and task completion time.

Legato использует методы продолжения на этапе обучения, инициализируя процесс денойзинга смесью известных действий и шума, что позволяет модели лучше понимать контекст выполнения.

Large-scale observational analysis estimates capability boundaries and performance predictions for foundation models using quantile regression and evaluates temporal stability across tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 For deploying foundation models, practitioners increasingly need prescriptive scaling laws: given a pre training compute budget, what downstream accuracy is attainable with contemporary post training practice, and how stable is that mapping as the field evolves? Using large scale observational evaluations with 5k observational and 2k newly sampled data on model performance, we estimate capability boundaries, high conditional quantiles of benchmark scores as a function of log pre training FLOPs, via smoothed quantile regression with a monotone, saturating sigmoid parameterization. We validate the temporal reliability by fitting on earlier model generations and evaluating on later releases. Across various tasks, the estimated boundaries are mostly stable, with the exception of math reasoning that exhibits a consistently advancing boundary over time. We then extend our approach to analyze task dependent saturation and to probe contamination related shifts on math reasoning tasks. Finally, we introduce an efficient algorithm that recovers near full data frontiers using roughly 20% of evaluation budget. Together, our work releases the Proteus 2k, the latest model performance evaluation dataset, and introduces a practical methodology for translating compute budgets into reliable performance expectations and for monitoring when capability boundaries shift across time.
