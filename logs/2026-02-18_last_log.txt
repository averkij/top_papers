Text:"6 2 0 2 5 1 ] . [ 1 1 1 1 4 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Sanity Checks for Sparse Autoencoders: Do SAEs Beat Random Baselines? Anton Korznikov * Andrey Galichin * Alexey Dontsov Oleg Y. Rogov Ivan Oseledets Elena TutubalinaSparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as promising tool for interpreting neural networks by decomposing their activations into sparse sets of human-interpretable features. Recent work has introduced multiple SAE variants and successfully scaled them to frontier models. Despite much excitement, growing number of negative results in downstream tasks casts doubt on whether SAEs recover meaningful features. To directly investigate this, we perform two complementary evaluations. On synthetic setup with known ground-truth features, we demonstrate that SAEs recover only 9% of true features despite achieving 71% explained variance, showing that they fail at their core task even when reconstruction is strong. To evaluate SAEs on real activations, we introduce three baselines that constrain SAE feature directions or their activation patterns to random values. Through extensive experiments across multiple SAE architectures, we show that our baselines match fully-trained SAEs in interpretability (0.87 vs 0.90), sparse probing (0.69 vs 0.72), and causal editing (0.73 vs 0.72). Together, these results suggest that SAEs in their current state do not reliably decompose models internal mechanisms. 1. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across wide range of natural language processing tasks, with applications continuing to expand rapidly. As these models grow in capability and deployment, the interpretation of their internal mechanisms becomes increasingly important (Bereska & Gavves, 2024; Grace et al., 2025). Interpretability could potentially help to understand specific learning behaviors, such as safety mechanisms (Arditi et al., 2024) and reasoning processes (Wang et al., 2023; Galichin et al., 2025), identify misalignment risks (Betley et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025). Sparse Au- *Equal contribution . Correspondence to: Anton Korznikov <korznikovantona@gmail.com>. Preprint. February 17, 2026. 1 toencoders (SAEs) serve as popular tool for this purpose, aiming to decompose dense model activations into sparse human-interpretable features (Bricken et al., 2023; Huben et al., 2024). Recent contributions have introduced various SAE architectures (Rajamanoharan et al., 2024b; Bussmann et al., 2024; Korznikov et al., 2025; Bussmann et al., 2025), with further success in scaling to frontier models (Gao et al., 2025; Lieberum et al., 2024). However, critical challenge remains: lacking ground truth for true features, it is difficult to determine whether SAEs recover meaningful representations. Recent negative results on downstream applications (Smith et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025) further underscore this challenge. To address this ambiguity, we propose systematic evaluation approach to assess whether SAEs learn meaningful feature decompositions. We first set up synthetic experiment with known ground-truth features and test whether state-of-the-art SAE architectures can recover them. Despite achieving 71% explained variance, SAEs recover only the highest-frequency features (9%), failing to discover the decomposition they are intended to find. Second, to evaluate SAEs on real activations where ground truth is unknown, we compare them against three easy-to-implement baselines on downstream tasks. These baselines constrain SAE feature directions or activation patterns to random values 1: (1) Frozen Decoder fixes directions to random vectors; (2) Frozen Encoder fixes activation patterns to random; (3) Soft-Frozen Decoder restricts directions to remain near random initialization. The rationale is straightforward: the learned directions and activation patterns represent the learned decomposition. Consequently, if SAEs learn meaningful features, they should outperform these baselines. Across multiple SAE architectures (Bricken et al., 2023; Rajamanoharan et al., 2024b; Bussmann et al., 2024), we find that our baselines match fully-trained SAEs on interpretability (Paulo et al., 2025) (0.87 vs 0.90), sparse probing (Karvonen et al., 2025) (0.69 vs 0.72), and causal editing (Huang et al., 2024; Karvonen et al., 2025) (0.73 vs 0.72). Together with our synthetic results, these findings suggest that current evaluation practices may be insufficient, and we offer our baselines as simple sanity checks for validating whether SAEs learn meaningful feature decompositions. Our work makes the following contributions: Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML Figure 1. Frozen SAE baselines and their performance. (Left) Conceptual diagrams: Frozen Decoder SAE (decoder weights fixed at random initialization), Soft-Frozen Decoder SAE (decoder weights initialized randomly and constrained to maintain CosineSim 0.8 with their initial values throughout training), and Frozen Encoder SAE (encoder weights fixed at random initialization). (Right) For BatchTopK SAE (L0=160), these baselines remain competitive with fully trained SAE across four key evaluation metrics, challenging the assumption that strong performance indicates meaningful feature learning. We demonstrate that SAEs fail on synthetic data with known ground-truth features, revealing disconnect between reconstruction fidelity and feature recovery. We introduce three easy-to-implement baselines for evaluating SAEs quality on real activations. Through extensive experiments, we find that our baselines match fully-trained SAEs, challenging the premise that SAEs learn meaningful features. 2. Background 2.1. Sparse Autoencoders for Interpretability Model Architecture and Decomposition SAEs have emerged as prominent tool for understanding neural network internals. It mainly addresses the challenge of polysemanticity, where individual neurons respond to multiple unrelated concepts (Bricken et al., 2023). The core motivation behind SAEs is the superposition hypothesis (Elhage et al., 2022), which posits that neural networks represent more features than they have dimensions by encoding them as directions in activation space. Formally, for an activation vector Rn, this hypothesis states that can be expressed as sparse linear combination of feature vectors: = (cid:88) j=1 aj fj, (1) ˆx = (cid:88) j=1 zj dj = (cid:88) j=1 zj Wdec = Wdecz, (2) where dj Rn are the learned decoder column vectors (the SAEs estimate of the true featu"

Sparse Autoencoders fail to reliably decompose neural network internals despite strong reconstruction performance, as demonstrated through synthetic and real activation evaluations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for interpreting neural networks by decomposing their activations into sparse sets of human-interpretable features. Recent work has introduced multiple SAE variants and successfully scaled them to frontier models. Despite much excitement, a growing number of negative results in downstream tasks casts doubt on whether SAEs recover meaningful features. To directly investigate this, we perform two complementary evaluations. On a synthetic setup with known ground-truth features, we demonstrate that SAEs recover only 9% of true features despite achieving 71% explained variance, showing that they fail at their core task even when reconstruction is strong. To evaluate SAEs on real activations, we introduce three baselines that constrain SAE feature directions or their activation patterns to random values. Through extensive experiments across multiple SAE architectures, we show that our baselines match fully-trained SAEs in interpretability (0.87 vs 0.90), sparse probing (0.69 vs 0.72), and causal editing (0.73 vs 0.72). Together, these results suggest that SAEs in their current state do not reliably decompose models' internal mechanisms.
