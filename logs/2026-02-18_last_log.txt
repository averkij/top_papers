However, enforcing single shared subspace can degrade accuracy even at moderate compression. Sparse dictionary learning provides more flexible union-of-subspaces representation, but existing approaches often suffer from iterative dictionary and coefficient updates. We propose COMPOT (CalibrationOptimized Matrix Procrustes Orthogonalization for Transformers), training-free compression framework that uses small calibration dataset to estimate sparse weight factorization. COMPOT employs orthogonal dictionaries that enable closed-form Procrustes updates for the dictionary and analytical single-step sparse coding for the coefficients, eliminating iterative optimization. To handle heterogeneous layer sensitivity under global compression budget, COMPOT further introduces one-shot dynamic allocation strategy that adaptively redistributes layer-wise compression rates. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures and tasks show that COMPOT consistently delivers superior qualitycompression trade-off over strong low-rank and sparse baselines, while remaining fully compatible with posttraining quantization for extreme compression. Code is available here. 1. Introduction Transformer-based foundation models underpin state-of-theart systems across modalities, including language, vision, vision-language, and audio (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy, 2020; Radford et al., 2021; Gong et al., 2021). As they scale to billions of parameters, deployment is increasingly limited by memory footprint, bandwidth, and compute 1Fundamental Research Center MWS AI 2ITMO. Correspondence to: Denis Makhov <d.makhov@mts.ai>, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis <s.lefkimmiatis@mts.ai>. Preprint. February 18, 2026. (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2023). Yet Transformers are highly redundant: attention heads and other components can often be removed or simplified with limited degradation, indicating that parameters contribute unevenly to downstream behavior (Michel et al., 2019; Voita et al., 2019). This has motivated extensive post-training compression work: quantization, pruning, distillation, and factorization - to reduce inference cost and memory footprint without expensive retraining (Tang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025). Low-rank matrix factorization is widely used post-training paradigm, replacing dense projection matrices by products of smaller matrices. Activation-aware and task-aware lowrank methods show that calibration/activation information is crucial for preserving accuracy (Hsu et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2023). Recent SVD-based methods further tailor truncation using calibration and principled losses: SVDLLM uses whitening-based calibration to relate singular values to truncation loss and applies closed-form updates to mitigate degradation (Wang et al., 2025b). Despite these advances, SVD methods still enforce single shared subspace per weight matrix, which can be restrictive when different columns lie in different local subspaces. Sparse dictionary learning offers complementary alternative, modeling weight matrix as dense dictionary times column-sparse coefficient matrix, enabling union-ofsubspaces representation. CoSpaDi shows that calibrationguided sparse dictionary learning can outperform dataaware low-rank baselines for training-free LLM compression (Shopkhoev et al., 2025b). Relatedly, MASA proposes matrix-based dictionary learning for parameter sharing in Transformer attention, representing layer-specific projections as combinations of shared matrix atoms (Zhussip et al., 2025). However, existing dictionary learning pipelines typically rely on iterative and expensive dictionary and sparse coding updates (e.g., K-SVD/OMP (Aharon et al., 2006)), limiting practicality at billion-parameter scale. We introduce COMPOT (Calibration-Optimized Matrix Procrustes Orthogonalization for Transformers), trainingfree compression framework that improves calibrationguided dictionary learning in both accuracy and compression time. Our key design choice is to enforce orthogonality and restrict the dictionary to be complete or undercomplete, COMPOT: Calibration-Optimized Matrix Procrustes Orthogonalization for Transformers Compression Figure 1. Comparison of low-rank decomposition, dictionary learning with sparse coding, and COMPOT. Low-rank uses rigid shared orthogonal basis B; dictionary learning enables flexible union-of-subspaces; COMPOT lies in between by using unionof-orthogonal-subspaces (denoted with O), which enables fast closed-form dictionary updates and lightweight coefficient update, improving compression performance. leveraging evidence that orthogonal dictionary learning can be effective and substantially faster than overcomplete alternatives (Bao et al., 2013). Under orthogonality, the dictionary update becomes the classical orthogonal Procrustes problem with closed-form SVD solution (Schonemann, 1966), replacing atom-wise K-SVD updates. Meanwhile, the sparse coding update also reduces to closed-form hardthresholding operation, avoiding iterative pursuits and yielding an efficient alternating procedure (Elad, 2010). Transformer layers and projection types exhibit heterogeneous redundancy. Prior work addresses this via nonuniform rank allocation (e.g., SVD-LLM V2) (Wang et al., 2025a) or differentiable truncation optimization (DobiSVD) (Qinsi et al., 2025). We instead propose one-shot global allocation strategy: we normalize each weight matrix, pool singular values across matrices into global spectrum, and truncate globally to satisfy model-wide budget, while enforcing constraints that prevent negative or low per-matrix compression and cap over-compression of sensitive layers. This yields simple, deterministic allocation procedure without iterative search over layer-wise ratios. COMPOT integrates naturally with post-training quantization. Among PTQ methods such as SmoothQuant (Xiao et al., 2023), GPTQ (Frantar et al., 2023), and AWQ (Lin et al., 2024), we show that 4-bit GPTQ applied on top of COMPOT yields superior results compared to quantization alone under equal memory budgets.

"COMPOT is a training-free compression framework for Transformer models that uses sparse dictionary learning with orthogonal dictionaries and closed-form updates to achieve better quality-compression trade-offs than traditional low-rank methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Post-training compression of Transformer models commonly relies on truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). However, enforcing a single shared subspace can degrade accuracy even at moderate compression. Sparse dictionary learning provides a more flexible union-of-subspaces representation, but existing approaches often suffer from iterative dictionary and coefficient updates. We propose COMPOT (Calibration-Optimized Matrix Procrustes Orthogonalization for Transformers), a training-free compression framework that uses a small calibration dataset to estimate a sparse weight factorization. COMPOT employs orthogonal dictionaries that enable closed-form Procrustes updates for the dictionary and analytical single-step sparse coding for the coefficients, eliminating iterative optimization. To handle heterogeneous layer sensitivity under a global compression budget, COMPOT further introduces a one-shot dynamic allocation strategy that adaptively redistributes layer-wise compression rates. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures and tasks show that COMPOT consistently delivers a superior quality-compression trade-off over strong low-rank and sparse baselines, while remaining fully compatible with post-training quantization for extreme compression.
