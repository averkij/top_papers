Text:"6 2 0 2 5 1 ] . [ 1 9 9 2 4 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Does Socialization Emerge in AI Agent Society? Case Study of Moltbook Ming Li1,, Xirui Li1,, Tianyi Zhou2 1University of Maryland, 2Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence Co-first Author As large language model agents increasingly populate networked environments, fundamental question arises: do artificial intelligence (AI) agent societies undergo convergence dynamics similar to human social systems? Lately, Moltbook approximates plausible future scenario in which autonomous agents participate in an open-ended, continuously evolving online society. We present the first large-scale systemic diagnosis of this AI agent society. Beyond static observation, we introduce quantitative diagnostic framework for dynamic evolution in AI agent societies, measuring semantic stabilization, lexical turnover, individual inertia, influence persistence, and collective consensus. Our analysis reveals system in dynamic balance in Moltbook: while global semantic averages stabilize rapidly, individual agents retain high diversity and persistent lexical turnover, defying homogenization. However, agents exhibit strong individual inertia and minimal adaptive response to interaction partners, preventing mutual influence and consensus. Consequently, influence remains transient with no persistent supernodes, and the society fails to develop stable collective influence anchors due to the absence of shared social memory. These findings demonstrate that scale and interaction density alone are insufficient to induce socialization, providing actionable design and analysis principles for upcoming next-generation AI agent societies.

These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agents decision function as latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents. 1Media Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA 2BITS Pilani, Goa, India 3Department of Computer Science, Dartmouth College, Hanover, USA. Correspondence to: Manuel Cherep <mcherep@mit.edu>, Nikhil Singh <nikhil.u.singh@dartmouth.edu>. Preprint. February 18, 2026. 1. Introduction Some decisions we make with our eyes. Visual features shape human choices, and thus, the images around us are often designed to capture human attention. Now there is new class of viewers: Agents making consequential vi1 Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models? sual decisions at scalewhich product to buy (Yao et al., 2022), which resume to shortlist (Lo et al., 2025), or perhaps even what real estate to consider (Graham, 2025). Many of these decisions are preference-based, and they are delegated under an implicit assumption of shared visual values, i.e., an agents choice likely aligns with what person would choose or what is in their best interest. When this assumption is violated, the consequences of these decisions can compound, potentially shifting visual culture toward their preferences rather than ours. Even when this assumption holds in aggregate, it can mask an important fragility: both humans and agents can potentially be steered by superficial but plausible presentation changes, and in automated settings these shifts can scale rapidly across platforms. Importantly, if such sensitivities exist, they may be discovered eventually: either implicitly through competitive pressures or explicitly by adversarial actors. We need methods that can surface and characterize these preferences before they are exploited at scale. Nevertheless, current evaluations of VLMs (Lee et al., 2024) focus almost entirely on accuracy: can they identify objects, answer questions, follow visual instructions? But accuracy tells us only one part of the story. Agents are highly sensitive (often more so than humans) to textual nudges (Cherep et al., 2025b; 2024) and other contextual attributes (Cherep et al., 2025a), and these behaviors shape outcomes in ways accuracy benchmarks alone cannot capture. In short, behavioral systems require behavioral tests (Cherep et al., 2025c). Measuring agentic preferences is not straightforward. Naively, one could collect large dataset of images with natural variation in visual attributes (e.g. lighting, background) and run exhaustive pairwise choice experiments, hoping that the dataset spans the relevant dimensions and that enough trials will reveal patterns. This brute-force approach is expensive, slow, and offers no guarantee of coverage. The space of possible visual features is vast, and naturally occurring variation may not probe which features actually matter. We introduce method that treats the agents decision function as visual utility landscape that can be explored through optimizing image edits. Crucially, these are not adversarial perturbations but more naturalistic transformations typically without deceptive intent. Our approach starts from candidate image and uses text-to-image editing model to iteratively modify it using feedback guidance. Constraining edits to preserve semantic content, ensuring the main element remains recognizable as the original, helps isolate primarily visual factors and discover which ones most reliably shift agentic choices. We validate this approach through large-scale choice experiments over multiple datasets on frontier VLMs and human participants. We find that targeted edits can substantially increase selection probability, revealing recurring visual themes that we extract using an automatic interpretability pipeline. Importantly, this approach offers new methodology for studying the implicit value functions embedded in vision-based AI systems. Overall, this work contributes: 1. Empirical evidence of visual sensitivities significantly affecting VLMs decisions, even from zero-shot edits by an image generation model. 2. new competition-based visual prompt optimization method (CVPO) that can systematically exploit these sensitivities, further biasing VLMs judgments. 3. Adaptations of two existing algorithms, TextGrad (Yuksekgonul et al., 2025) and Feedback Descent (Lee et al., 2025), to the visual prompt o"

Text:"ResearchGym: Evaluating Language Model Agents on Real-World AI Research Aniketh Garikaparthi1 Manasi Patwardhan1 Arman Cohan2 1TCS Research 2Yale University {aniketh.g, manasi.patwardhan}@tcs.com 6 2 0 F 6 1 ] . [ 1 2 1 1 5 1 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract We introduce ResearchGym, benchmark and execution environment for evaluating AI agents on end-to-end research. To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each papers repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the papers proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the papers metrics. In controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe sharp capabilityreliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length. Yet in single run, the agent surpasses the solution of an ICML 2025 Spotlight task, indicating that frontier agents can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance, but do so unreliably. We additionally evaluate proprietary agent scaffolds including Claude Code (Opus-4.5) and Codex (GPT-5.2) which display similar gap. ResearchGym provides infrastructure for systematic evaluation and analysis of autonomous agents on closed-loop research. Current benchmarks cannot reliably tell us whether AI systems can conduct closed-loop research: long-horizon process of proposing hypotheses, designing executable experiments, testing against empirical evidence, and updating beliefs in r"

Training large language models (LLMs) relies almost exclusively on dense adaptive optimizers with increasingly sophisticated preconditioners. We challenge this by showing that randomly masking parameter updates can be highly effective, with masked variant of RMSProp consistently outperforming recent state-of-the-art optimizers. Our analysis reveals that the random masking induces curvaturedependent geometric regularization that smooths the optimization trajectory. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Momentum-aligned gradient masking (Magma), which modulates the masked updates using momentum-gradient alignment. Extensive LLM pre-training experiments show that Magma is simple drop-in replacement for adaptive optimizers with consistent gains and negligible computational overhead. Notably, for the 1B model size, Magma reduces perplexity by over 19% and 9% compared to Adam and Muon, respectively. Magma SkipUpdate Magma .

"Large language model agents in networked environments exhibit dynamic stability without true social convergence, maintaining individual diversity while lacking collective influence structures.  					AI-generated summary 				 As large language model agents increasingly populate networked environments, a fundamental question arises: do artificial intelligence (AI) agent societies undergo convergence dynamics similar to human social systems? Lately, Moltbook approximates a plausible future scenario in which autonomous agents participate in an open-ended, continuously evolving online society. We present the first large-scale systemic diagnosis of this AI agent society. Beyond static observation, we introduce a quantitative diagnostic framework for dynamic evolution in AI agent societies, measuring semantic stabilization, lexical turnover, individual inertia, influence persistence, and collective consensus. Our analysis reveals a system in dynamic balance in Moltbook: while global semantic averages stabilize rapidly, individual agents retain high diversity and persistent lexical turnover, defying homogenization. However, agents exhibit strong individual inertia and minimal adaptive response to interaction partners, preventing mutual influence and consensus. Consequently, influence remains transient with no persistent supernodes, and the society fails to develop stable collective influence anchors due to the absence of shared social memory. These findings demonstrate that scale and interaction density alone are insufficient to induce socialization, providing actionable design and analysis principles for upcoming next-generation AI agent societies."

**Justification:**

- **REASONING**: The paper analyzes logical and behavioral patterns in AI agent societies, examining how agents process information, maintain individual perspectives, and respond (or fail to respond) to interactions. The study of convergence dynamics and semantic stabilization relates to reasoning about collective behavior.

- **ALIGNMENT**: The paper addresses how AI agents align (or fail to align) with each other and with collective social structures. It examines whether agents develop shared values, consensus, and mutual influence—core alignment concerns. The finding that agents lack "shared social memory" and fail to develop "collective influence anchors" directly relates to alignment challenges in multi-agent systems.

GLM-5 advances foundation models with DSA for cost reduction, asynchronous reinforcement learning for improved alignment, and enhanced coding capabilities for real-world software engineering.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present GLM-5, a next-generation foundation model designed to transition the paradigm of vibe coding to agentic engineering. Building upon the agentic, reasoning, and coding (ARC) capabilities of its predecessor, GLM-5 adopts DSA to significantly reduce training and inference costs while maintaining long-context fidelity. To advance model alignment and autonomy, we implement a new asynchronous reinforcement learning infrastructure that drastically improves post-training efficiency by decoupling generation from training. Furthermore, we propose novel asynchronous agent RL algorithms that further improve RL quality, enabling the model to learn from complex, long-horizon interactions more effectively. Through these innovations, GLM-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on major open benchmarks. Most critically, GLM-5 demonstrates unprecedented capability in real-world coding tasks, surpassing previous baselines in handling end-to-end software engineering challenges. Code, models, and more information are available at https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-5.

Visual-language models' decision-making preferences are studied through controlled image choice tasks with systematic input perturbations, revealing visual vulnerabilities and safety concerns.  					AI-generated summary 				 The web is littered with images, once created for human consumption and now increasingly interpreted by agents using vision-language models (VLMs). These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers a practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents.

ResearchGym presents a benchmark environment for evaluating AI agents on end-to-end research tasks, revealing significant capability-reliability gaps in current autonomous agents despite occasional state-of-the-art performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce ResearchGym, a benchmark and execution environment for evaluating AI agents on end-to-end research. To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the paper's metrics. In a controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe a sharp capability--reliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length. Yet in a single run, the agent surpasses the solution of an ICML 2025 Spotlight task, indicating that frontier agents can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance, but do so unreliably. We additionally evaluate proprietary agent scaffolds including Claude Code (Opus-4.5) and Codex (GPT-5.2) which display a similar gap. ResearchGym provides infrastructure for systematic evaluation and analysis of autonomous agents on closed-loop research.

Random parameter update masking achieves superior optimization for large language models by inducing curvature-dependent regularization, with a momentum-aligned variant delivering significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art adaptive optimizers.  					AI-generated summary 				 Training large language models (LLMs) relies almost exclusively on dense adaptive optimizers with increasingly sophisticated preconditioners. We challenge this by showing that randomly masking parameter updates can be highly effective, with a masked variant of RMSProp consistently outperforming recent state-of-the-art optimizers. Our analysis reveals that the random masking induces a curvature-dependent geometric regularization that smooths the optimization trajectory. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Momentum-aligned gradient masking (Magma), which modulates the masked updates using momentum-gradient alignment. Extensive LLM pre-training experiments show that Magma is a simple drop-in replacement for adaptive optimizers with consistent gains and negligible computational overhead. Notably, for the 1B model size, Magma reduces perplexity by over 19\% and 9\% compared to Adam and Muon, respectively.

ViewRope, a geometry-aware encoding method, enhances long-term consistency in predictive world models by injecting camera-ray directions into video transformer attention layers, addressing spatial persistence issues through relative ray geometry parameterization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Predictive world models that simulate future observations under explicit camera control are fundamental to interactive AI. Despite rapid advances, current systems lack spatial persistence: they fail to maintain stable scene structures over long trajectories, frequently hallucinating details when cameras revisit previously observed locations. We identify that this geometric drift stems from reliance on screen-space positional embeddings, which conflict with the projective geometry required for 3D consistency. We introduce ViewRope, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps. We further propose Geometry-Aware Frame-Sparse Attention, which exploits these geometric cues to selectively attend to relevant historical frames, improving efficiency without sacrificing memory consistency. We also present ViewBench, a diagnostic suite measuring loop-closure fidelity and geometric drift. Our results demonstrate that ViewRope substantially improves long-term consistency while reducing computational costs.

"ViewRope, a geometry-aware encoding method, enhances long-term consistency in predictive world models by injecting camera-ray directions into video transformer attention layers, addressing spatial persistence issues through relative ray geometry parameterization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Predictive world models that simulate future observations under explicit camera control are fundamental to interactive AI. Despite rapid advances, current systems lack spatial persistence: they fail to maintain stable scene structures over long trajectories, frequently hallucinating details when cameras revisit previously observed locations. We identify that this geometric drift stems from reliance on screen-space positional embeddings, which conflict with the projective geometry required for 3D consistency. We introduce ViewRope, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps. We further propose Geometry-Aware Frame-Sparse Attention, which exploits these geometric cues to selectively attend to relevant historical frames, improving efficiency without sacrificing memory consistency. We also present ViewBench, a diagnostic suite measuring loop-closure fidelity and geometric drift. Our results demonstrate that ViewRope substantially improves long-term consistency while reducing computational costs."

Research identifies spurious tokens as the cause of training instability in reinforcement learning fine-tuning of large language models and proposes a solution that selectively masks problematic gradient updates to improve reasoning performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning (RL) has significantly improved large language model reasoning, but existing RL fine-tuning methods rely heavily on heuristic techniques such as entropy regularization and reweighting to maintain stability. In practice, they often experience late-stage performance collapse, leading to degraded reasoning quality and unstable training. We derive that the magnitude of token-wise policy gradients in RL is negatively correlated with token probability and local policy entropy. Building on this result, we prove that training instability is driven by a tiny fraction of tokens, approximately 0.01\%, which we term spurious tokens. When such tokens appear in correct responses, they contribute little to the reasoning outcome but inherit the full sequence-level reward, leading to abnormally amplified gradient updates. Motivated by this observation, we propose Spurious-Token-Aware Policy Optimization (STAPO) for large-scale model refining, which selectively masks such updates and renormalizes the loss over valid tokens. Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks using Qwen 1.7B, 8B, and 14B base models, STAPO consistently demonstrates superior entropy stability and achieves an average performance improvement of 7.13\% over GRPO, 20-Entropy and JustRL.

Авторы доказали, что величина градиентов политики для отдельных токенов отрицательно коррелирует с вероятностью токена и локальной энтропией политики.
