However, in 3D scene understanding, self-supervised methods are typically only used as weight initialization step for task-specific fine-tuning, limiting their utility for generalpurpose feature extraction. This paper addresses this shortcoming by proposing robust evaluation protocol specifically designed to assess the quality of self-supervised features for 3D scene understanding. Our protocol uses multiresolution feature sampling of hierarchical models to create rich point-level representations that capture the semantic capabilities of the model and, hence, are suitable for evaluation with linear probing and nearest-neighbor methods. Furthermore, we introduce the first self-supervised model that performs similarly to supervised models when only off-the-shelf features are used in linear probing setup. In particular, our model is trained natively in 3D with novel self-supervised approach based on Masked Scene Modeling objective, which reconstructs deep features of masked patches in bottom-up manner and is specifically tailored to hierarchical 3D models. Our experiments not only demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance to supervised models, but also surpasses existing self-supervised approaches by large margin. The model and training code can be found at our Github repository. 1. Introduction 2D self-supervised models, such as DINOv2 [28], have become an integral part of modern computer vision. These models are typically pre-trained on large unlabeled datasets, providing task-agnostic features that can be used off-theshelf to solve any computer vision task without the need for fine-tuning, making them particularly useful in scenarios with limited data [13]. In contrast to 2D computer vision, the field of 3D scene understanding lacks comparable models. Instead, it relies on consolidating features from 2D foundation models into 3D [26, 30, 40] or using them in 2D-3D knowledge distillation setup [8, 55, 59]. Although this is still an emerging field, self-supervised methods for processing 3D scenes have started to gain traction, with several approaches emerging in recent years [19, 42, 43, 45, 46, 50]. Some of these methods incorporate Masked Image Modelling (MIM) objectives [17, 28, 48, 58] in their 3D scene-based frameworks [43, 50], where the model is tasked with reconstructing the input scene from partial view. In the 2D domain, such learning objectives have been shown to lead to semantically rich features better suited for dense prediction tasks [28], achieving unprecedented performance for off-the-shelf feature evaluations. Unfortunately, self-supervised learning on 3D scenes has so far failed to exhibit such semantic properties off-theshelf, and it is used as weight initialization step before fine-tuning the model in downstream task. We believe this is due to two main limitations: (i) The lack of systematic protocol specific to 3D scene understanding to evaluate the representations learned by such models, and (ii) the lack of an effective 3D-scene specific masked prediction objective that takes into account the hierarchical nature of these models. In this paper, we aim to address these limitations: (i) First, we advocate that, to advance the field, we necessitate an evaluation protocol to directly evaluate the quality of the representations learned by self-supervised methods tailored explicitly to 3D scenes. Models designed for 3D scene understanding have hierarchical nature, usually following UNet [35] design. Naively using the output of the last layer of such hierarchical models for off-theshelf feature evaluation might not reflect the underlying semantic capabilities of the self-supervised model. In supervised setup, such models discard unnecessary information for the downstream task during decoding, whereas in self-supervised setup, this information may be relevant for producing task-agnostic features. To address this, we use tri-linear interpolation to upsample the feature maps of each decoder level and combine them to create final taskagnostic feature map. The resulting set of features retains the hierarchical information otherwise lost during decoding and can then be used for off-the-shelf feature evaluation in linear probing or nearest-neighbor setup. This evaluation reflects the effectiveness of representations learned by selfsupervised models better than fine-tuning protocol does, since the quality of the features is not masked by further optimization on the downstream task. In pilot study, we demonstrate that our hierarchical evaluation approach more effectively reveals the off-the-shelf feature capabilities of self-supervised methods. Furthermore, this study reveals significant performance gap between supervised and selfsupervised training, highlighting the necessity for framework better suited for 3D scenes. (ii) To address this gap, we propose hierarchical selfsupervised framework based on the MIM objective specifically designed for models that process 3D scenes. We argue that the failure of existing MIM approaches to learn semantically relevant features from self-supervised learning alone is rooted in their design choices: Some methods mask the input features of the 3D points [43], letting the model infer those from the geometry, simplifying the masking objective. Additionally, some methods use the reconstruction of input features [43, 50] as training objective instead of deep features, which leads to reduced semantic information [2]. Lastly, existing methods do not consider the hierarchical nature of their models when designing the reco"

Self-supervised learning has transformed 2D computer vision by enabling models trained on large, unannotated datasets to provide versatile off-the-shelf features that perform similarly to models trained with labels. However, in 3D scene understanding, self-supervised methods are typically only used as a weight initialization step for task-specific fine-tuning, limiting their utility for general-purpose feature extraction. This paper addresses this shortcoming by proposing a robust evaluation protocol specifically designed to assess the quality of self-supervised features for 3D scene understanding. Our protocol uses multi-resolution feature sampling of hierarchical models to create rich point-level representations that capture the semantic capabilities of the model and, hence, are suitable for evaluation with linear probing and nearest-neighbor methods. Furthermore, we introduce the first self-supervised model that performs similarly to supervised models when only off-the-shelf features are used in a linear probing setup. In particular, our model is trained natively in 3D with a novel self-supervised approach based on a Masked Scene Modeling objective, which reconstructs deep features of masked patches in a bottom-up manner and is specifically tailored to hierarchical 3D models. Our experiments not only demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance to supervised models, but also surpasses existing self-supervised approaches by a large margin. The model and training code can be found at our Github repository (https://github.com/phermosilla/msm).
