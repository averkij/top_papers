Text:"Unified World Models: Coupling Video and Action Diffusion for Pretraining on Large Robotic Datasets Chuning Zhu, Raymond Yu, Siyuan Feng, Benjamin Burchfiel, Paarth Shah, and Abhishek Gupta Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington Toyota Research Institute 5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 2 9 7 2 0 . 4 0 5 2 : r AbstractImitation learning has emerged as promising approach towards building generalist robots. However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data provides rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation required for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, UWM integrates an action diffusion process and video diffusion process within unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent policy, forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and video generator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM offers promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous da"

This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation required for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

UWM интегрирует процессы диффузии действий и видео в единую архитектуру трансформера. Исследование показывает, что UWM позволяет эффективно предобучать модели на масштабных мультизадачных наборах данных для роботов. Кроме того, UWM облегчает обучение на видеоданных без действий, что улучшает производительность дообученных политик.",
