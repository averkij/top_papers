Text:"Seedream 4.0: Toward Next-generation Multimodal Image GenerationWe introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing, and multi-image composition within single framework. We develop highly efficient diffusion transformer with powerful VAE which also can reduce the number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g., 1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of textimage pairs spanning diverse taxonomies and knowledgecentric concepts. Comprehensive data collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong generalization. By incorporating carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation, distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It achieves an inference time of up to 1.4 seconds for generating 2K image (without LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream 4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images. This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both creativity and professional applications.

Building on recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs), state-of-the-art open-source and commercial systems have emerged, such as Stable Diffusion [18], FLUX series [7, 8], Seedream models [3, 4, 21], GPT-4o image generation [15] and Gemini 2.5 flash [5]. However, as the demand for higher image quality, greater controllability, and strong multimodal capabilities (e.g., text-to-image (T2I) synthesis and image editing) increases, current models often have critical scalability bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce Seedream 4.0, powerful multimodal generative model engineered for scalability and efficiency. We develop an efficient and scalable DiT backbone, which substantially increases the model capacity while reducing the training and inference FLOPs considerably. To further enhance model efficiency, especially for high-resolution image generation, we have developed an efficient Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with high compression ratio, significantly reducing the number of image tokens in latent space. This architectural design (including our DiT and VAE) makes our model highly efficient, easily scalable, and hardware-friendly in both training and inference. Our training strategy is meticulously designed to unlock the full potential of our architecture, achieving more than 10 inference acceleration compared to Seedream 3.0 [3], while having significantly better performance. This allows the model to be trained effectively on billions of textimage pairs at native image resolutions ranging from 1K to 4K, covering wide range of taxonomy and knowledge-centric concepts.

Our approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step generation. We introduce two key innovations: timestep sharing to reduce gradient noise and split-timestep fine-tuning to improve prompt alignment. Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly accessible for practical deployment. Todays best image generation models are trapped in datacenters. While rectified flow models achieve unprecedented quality, their computational demands 25+ steps, 16GB+ VRAM, 30+ seconds per image make them inaccessible to everyday devices. We bridge this gap, enabling high-quality generation from mobile phones to gaming desktops. Timestep distillation offers path forward. Approaches like distribution matching can reduce step counts in multi-step diffusion inference, but the core challenge emerges from how distribution matching operates in few-step flow distillation. Standard approaches (Yin et al., 2024a; Starodubcev et al., 2025) require re-noising samples on trajectory end-points to compute distribution divergences at various noi"

[ 1 7 1 3 1 2 . 9 0 5 2 : r Abstract Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these coarse-grained signals fail to capture users nuanced behavior motivations and intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support this paradigm, we develop RecBot, dual-agent architecture where Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and longterm online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes. CCS Concepts Information systems Recomm"

[ 1 5 4 2 1 2 . 9 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Hunyuan3D-Omni is unified framework for supporting controllable generation based on point cloud, bounding box, voxel, and skeleton.Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, unified framework for fine-grained, controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images, Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry, topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model unifies all signals in single cross-modal architecture. We train with progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals ( e.g., skeletal pose) while downweighting easier ones ( e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production workflows.3D generation is fundamental task in computer vision and computational imaging, with applications spanning virtual reality, gaming, and film. As the volume of 3D data continues to grow, native 3D generation has emerged as mainstream approach, offering significant advantages in 1 both quality and speed. It is anticipated that, with the ongoing expansion of high-quality 3D datasets, 3D generation models will evolve into the next generation of automated modeling tools, facilitating faster workflows and dynamic interactions in digital content creation. Native 3D generation primarily involves two key components: the 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and the 3D latent diffusion model (LDM). For example, method utilizing VecSet representation employs 3D VAE to compress point clouds into VecSet, from which decoder retrieves the Signed Distance Function (SDF) field for the 3D model. An iso-surface sampling technique is then applied to generate the visible 3D model from the SDF field. Similarly, the 3D LDM builds on the VecSet representation by stacking multiple layers of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) to facilitate the learning process from images to their corresponding 3D representations in VecSet form. Recent advancements, such as Hunyuan3D 2.1 Hunyuan3D et al. (2025), have showcased the powerful capabilities of native 3D generation for efficient and high-quality 3D modeling Zhao et al. (2024); Li et al. (2024). Despite these significant advancements, generating 3D assets from single image remains an ill-posed problem, complicating the accurate reconstruction of complete 3D structures. This often results in uncertainties and ambiguities in 3D geometry generation. To enhance geometric accuracy, it is crucial to incorporate additional information through controllable generation techniques. Such techniques not only improve geometric fidelity but also enable customized outputs by imposing specific conditions. For instance, the integration of depth information can alleviate geometric distortions and spatial misalignments caused by viewpoint variations and self-occlusion, while also enriching geometric details. Recent studies, including Clay Zhang et al. (2024b) and PoseMaster Yan et al. (2025b), have made notable progress in introducing additional conditions for downstream editing and pose control within the realm of 3D native generation models. Nevertheless, there remains need for further exploration in developing systematic and unified 3D controllable model. In this paper, we introduce Hunyuan3D-Omni, unified framework for fine-grained and controllable 3D asset generation. Building upon the foundational model Hunyuan3D 2.1 and following the workflow of 2D controllable generation models, Hunyuan3D-Omni enhances controllability and geometric accuracy by integrating various additional conditions, including point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletons. To optimize training and model deployment costs, we consolidate these additional conditions into single generative model. Specifically, we utilize point clouds to represent these extra conditions and propose unified control encoder to differentiate between them and obtain corresponding embeddings. To preserve the structure and functionality of the base model, we concatenate the extracted embeddings with the DINO features of the input image. This approach allows us to achieve controllable 3D generation with minimal training steps. Experimental results demonstrate that Hunyuan3D-Omni effectively addresses common challenges in native 3D generation, such as distortions, flatness, missing details, and aspect ratio discrepancies, by providing additional control signals. Furthermore, it facilitates the standardization of character poses and the stylization of generated outputs, offering new perspectives and solutions for post-training applications in 3D generation.2.1 3D Native Generation In recent years, the field of 3D generation has advanced rapidly, bringing significant impact to domains such as gaming, film, and animation. Early works include SDS and multi-view supervision approaches Poole et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023b;a; 2024); Voleti et al. (2025) leverage pretrained image diffusion models to supervise the optimization of radiance fields Mildenhall et al. (2021) or NeuS Wang et al. (2021), thereby enabling 3D object generation. However, these methods suffer from multi-view consistency issues and slow generation speed, often producing noisy geometry. To address efficiency, LRM Hong et al. (2023) introduces feed-forward architecture that directly outputs tri-plane radiance field, enabling fast single-image-to-3D generation. Subsequent works Yang et al. (2024); Tang et al. (2024); Xu et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2024a) adopt similar strategies, but their results remain limited in geometric detail and texture fidelity. 3DShape2VecSet Zhang et al. (2023a) i"

Variance-Aware Sampling and large-scale CoT data improve multimodal reasoning models by stabilizing RL fine-tuning and enhancing performance on benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open, large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty, and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase. (3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales, establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition, we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize this guarantee.

Seedream 4.0 is a high-performance multimodal image generation system that integrates text-to-image synthesis, image editing, and multi-image composition using a diffusion transformer and VAE, achieving state-of-the-art results with efficient training and inference.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing, and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g., 1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation, distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image (without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream 4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images. This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

"Seedream 4.0 is a high-performance multimodal image generation system that integrates text-to-image synthesis, image editing, and multi-image composition using a diffusion transformer and VAE, achieving state-of-the-art results with efficient training and inference.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing, and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g., 1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation, distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image (without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream 4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images. This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream."

SD3.5-Flash is an efficient few-step distillation framework that enhances image generation on consumer devices using rectified flow models with innovations like timestep sharing and split-timestep fine-tuning.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment. Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly accessible for practical deployment.

IRF, a new recommendation system using natural language commands, improves user satisfaction and business outcomes through a dual-agent architecture and simulation-augmented knowledge distillation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.   To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes.

Hunyuan3D-Omni is a unified 3D asset generation framework that accepts multiple conditioning signals, improving controllability and robustness in production workflows.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained, controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images, Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry, topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production workflows.

"Hunyuan3D-Omni is a unified 3D asset generation framework that accepts multiple conditioning signals, improving controllability and robustness in production workflows.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained, controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images, Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry, topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production workflows."

StyleBench evaluates various reasoning styles across tasks and models, revealing that strategy efficacy depends on model scale and task type.  					AI-generated summary 				 The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts. However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles, including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought (AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale. Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

A novel reinforcement learning algorithm, CE-GPPO, reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens to improve the exploration-exploitation balance in training large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose Controlling Entropy via Gradient-Preserving Policy Optimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.

SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework, uses a language model-based planner to iteratively refine 3D scene synthesis, achieving high physical, visual, and semantic quality across diverse instructions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

"SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework, uses a language model-based planner to iteratively refine 3D scene synthesis, achieving high physical, visual, and semantic quality across diverse instructions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

A novel framework using Schoenfeld's Episode Theory is introduced to analyze the reasoning patterns of Large Reasoning Models in solving math problems, providing a benchmark for machine reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate extensive chain-of-thought reasoning, we lack a principled framework for understanding how these thoughts are structured. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach by applying Schoenfeld's Episode Theory, a classic cognitive framework for human mathematical problem-solving, to analyze the reasoning traces of LRMs. We annotated thousands of sentences and paragraphs from model-generated solutions to math problems using seven cognitive labels (e.g., Plan, Implement, Verify). The result is the first publicly available benchmark for the fine-grained analysis of machine reasoning, including a large annotated corpus and detailed annotation guidebooks. Our preliminary analysis reveals distinct patterns in LRM reasoning, such as the transition dynamics between cognitive states. This framework provides a theoretically grounded methodology for interpreting LRM cognition and enables future work on more controllable and transparent reasoning systems.

A scientific reasoning foundation model pre-trained on diverse scientific data supports multiple tasks and enhances cross-domain generalization and fidelity through specialized training techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present a scientific reasoning foundation model that aligns natural language with heterogeneous scientific representations. The model is pretrained on a 206B-token corpus spanning scientific text, pure sequences, and sequence-text pairs, then aligned via SFT on 40M instructions, annealed cold-start bootstrapping to elicit long-form chain-of-thought, and reinforcement learning with task-specific reward shaping, which instills deliberate scientific reasoning. It supports four capability families, covering up to 103 tasks across workflows: (i) faithful translation between text and scientific formats, (ii) text/knowledge extraction, (iii) property prediction, (iv) property classification, (v) unconditional and conditional sequence generation and design. Compared with specialist systems, our approach broadens instruction coverage, improves cross-domain generalization, and enhances fidelity. We detail data curation and training and show that cross-discipline learning strengthens transfer and downstream reliability.
