QuantVGGT, a quantization framework for Visual Geometry Grounded Transformers, achieves state-of-the-art results with memory reduction and acceleration while maintaining high reconstruction accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7times memory reduction and 2.5times acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in https://github.com/wlfeng0509/QuantVGGT.

The framework addresses the challenges of high memory usage and slow processing speeds that hinder the deployment of these models in real-world applications. It introduces two key techniques: Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained Quantization to handle heavy-tailed activation distributions, and Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling to stabilize calibration for quantization. As a result, QuantVGGT achieves significant improvements in memory efficiency and processing speed while maintaining high reconstruction accuracy, making it suitable for resource-limited environments.', title='Revolutionizing 3D Reconstruction with Efficient Quantization'))
