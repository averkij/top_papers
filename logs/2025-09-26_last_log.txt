SHINE is a training-free framework that uses manifold-steered anchor loss and pretrained customization adapters to seamlessly insert objects into new scenes with high fidelity, addressing challenges like complex lighting and diverse inputs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g., DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward). Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

V-GameGym is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating code generation in game development, focusing on multimodal evaluation including playability, visual aesthetics, and user engagement.  					AI-generated summary 				 Code large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in programming tasks, yet current benchmarks primarily focus on single modality rather than visual game development. Most existing code-related benchmarks evaluate syntax correctness and execution accuracy, overlooking critical game-specific metrics such as playability, visual aesthetics, and user engagement that are essential for real-world deployment. To address the gap between current LLM capabilities in algorithmic problem-solving and competitive programming versus the comprehensive requirements of practical game development, we present V-GameGym, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 2,219 high-quality samples across 100 thematic clusters derived from real-world repositories, adopting a novel clustering-based curation methodology to ensure both diversity and structural completeness. Further, we introduce a multimodal evaluation framework with an automated LLM-driven pipeline for visual code synthesis using complete UI sandbox environments. Our extensive analysis reveals that V-GameGym effectively bridges the gap between code generation accuracy and practical game development workflows, providing quantifiable quality metrics for visual programming and interactive element generation.

The causal mask in Transformer decoders induces position-dependent attention patterns, which can interact with explicit positional encodings like RoPE, affecting their relative attention score patterns.  					AI-generated summary 				 While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

Анализ показал, что индуцированные паттерны внимания склонны отдавать предпочтение близким парам запрос-ключ, имитируя поведение обычных позиционных кодировок. Взаимодействие каузальной маски и RoPE искажает относительные паттерны оценок внимания RoPE, превращая их в неотносительные. Этот эффект последовательно наблюдается в современных больших языковых моделях, что подчёркивает важность рассмотрения каузальной маски как источника позиционной информации.",

"The causal mask in Transformer decoders induces position-dependent attention patterns, which can interact with explicit positional encodings like RoPE, affecting their relative attention score patterns.  					AI-generated summary 				 While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings."

ReflectDrive uses a reflection mechanism with discrete diffusion and pre-trained Diffusion Language Models to generate safe trajectories for autonomous driving systems.  					AI-generated summary 				 End-to-End (E2E) solutions have emerged as a mainstream approach for autonomous driving systems, with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models representing a new paradigm that leverages pre-trained multimodal knowledge from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and interact with complex real-world environments. However, these methods remain constrained by the limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges, we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable solution for autonomous driving systems.
