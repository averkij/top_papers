While language-centric embodied agents have garnered substantial attention, MLLM-based embodied agents remain underexplored due to the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we introduce EMBODIEDBENCH, an extensive benchmark designed to evaluate visiondriven embodied agents. EMBODIEDBENCH features: (1) diverse set of 1,128 testing tasks across four environments, ranging from high-level semantic tasks (e.g., household) to low-level tasks involving atomic actions (e.g., navigation and manipulation); and (2) six meticulously curated subsets evaluating essential agent capabilities like commonsense reasoning, complex instruction understanding, spatial awareness, visual perception, and long-term planning. Through extensive experiments, we evaluated 13 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs within EMBODIEDBENCH. Our findings reveal that: MLLMs excel at highlevel tasks but struggle with low-level manipulation, with the best model, GPT-4o, scoring only 28.9% on average. EMBODIEDBENCH provides multifaceted standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance MLLMbased embodied agents. Our code is available at https://embodiedbench.github.io. 1. Introduction Developing embodied agents capable of solving complex tasks in real world remains significant challenge (Durante *Equal contribution 1University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign 2Northwestern University. 3University of Toronto. 4Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago. Work done during internship at UIUC. Correspondence to: Rui Yang <ry21@illinois.edu>. Preprint et al., 2024). Recent advancements in foundation modelsincluding Large Language Models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024a) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) (OpenAI, 2024a; Reid et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023c; 2025)have unlocked unprecedented potential toward this goal. These models, trained on extensive internet-scale datasets, demonstrate exceptional proficiency in understanding human knowledge and performing human-like reasoning. Based on these capabilities, researchers can now design intelligent agents that use off-the-shelf foundation models to solve complex tasks through interaction with environments (Huang et al., 2022a;b; 2023c; Ahn et al., 2022; Song et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2024). Given the multitude of proposed algorithms, there is pressing need for standardized and automated evaluation frameworks to enable comprehensive assessment and comparison. To address this need, several initiatives have been exploring LLM-based embodied agent evaluation (Liu et al., 2023b; Choi et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024b). While these efforts significantly contribute to understanding LLM-based agent design, the evaluation of MLLM embodied agents remains underexplored, posing challenge for creating more versatile agents. VisualAgentBench (Liu et al., 2024e) represents the first benchmark for evaluating MLLM agents, covering embodied tasks such as household and Minecraft. However, its limited scope, focusing exclusively on high-level planning, leaves critical questions unanswered, such as the role of vision in embodied tasks and the performance of MLLM agents in low-level tasks like navigation and manipulation. To address these questions, we introduce EMBODIEDBENCH, comprehensive benchmark comprising 1,128 testing instances across four environments. EMBODIEDBENCH is designed with two key features that set it apart from existing benchmarks: 1. Diverse tasks with hierarchical action levels. Among the four environments, EB-ALFRED and EBHabitat focus on high-level task decomposition and planning (e.g., put book on the desk), while EB-Navigation and EB-Manipulation demand planning with low-level actions EMBODIEDBENCH: Comprehensive Benchmarking Multi-modal Large Language Models for Vision-Driven Embodied Agents Figure 1. Overview of EMBODIEDBENCH. Two key features of our benchmark: various action levels and capability-oriented evaluation. (e.g., translational/rotational control) and require precise perception and spatial reasoning. 2. Capability-oriented evaluation. Unlike previous benchmarks that primarily emphasize overall accuracy (Liu et al., 2023b; Choi et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024e) or module-specific performance (Li et al., 2024b), EMBODIEDBENCH introduces fine-grained evaluation framework that assesses six critical capabilities of embodied agents, including basic task solving, commonsense reasoning, complex instruction understanding, spatial awareness, visual perception, and long-horizon planning. To facilitate the evaluation of MLLMs as embodied agents, we design unified agent framework that integrates egocentric visual perception, few-shot in-context examples, interaction history, and environment feedback for decisionmaking. This powerful framework can unlock the full potential of current off-the-shelf MLLMs and tackle both highlevel and low-level tasks effectively. Based on EMBODIEDBENCH and our agent pipeline, we evaluate 13 leading closed-source MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude3.5) and 7B90B open-source models (e.g., Llama-3.2 Vision(Meta, 2024), InternVL 2.5(Chen et al., 2025), Qwen2VL(Wang et al., 2024)). Our evaluation yields three key findings: (1) While MLLMs excel at high-level tasks, they struggle with low-level manipulation. (2) Long-horizon planning emerges as the most challenging subset. (3) Vision input is crucial for low-level tasks, with performance degrading by 40%70% when removed, whereas its impact on high-level tasks is minimal. Additionally, our ablation studies provide practical insights into MLLM agent design, particularly regarding image resolution, multi-step image input, and visual in-context learning. Our contributions are threefold: (1) proposing comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating MLLM-based embodied agents with different action"

EmbodiedBench features: (1) a diverse set of 1,128 testing tasks across four environments, ranging from high-level semantic tasks (e.g., household) to low-level tasks involving atomic actions (e.g., navigation and manipulation); and (2) six meticulously curated subsets evaluating essential agent capabilities like commonsense reasoning, complex instruction understanding, spatial awareness, visual perception, and long-term planning. Through extensive experiments, we evaluated 13 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs within EmbodiedBench. Our findings reveal that: MLLMs excel at high-level tasks but struggle with low-level manipulation, with the best model, GPT-4o, scoring only 28.9% on average. EmbodiedBench provides a multifaceted standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance MLLM-based embodied agents. Our code is available at https://embodiedbench.github.io."

Multimodal embedding models have gained significant attention for their ability to map data from different modalities, such as text and images, into a unified representation space. However, the limited labeled multimodal data often hinders embedding performance. Recent approaches have leveraged data synthesis to address this problem, yet the quality of synthetic data remains a critical bottleneck. In this work, we identify three criteria for high-quality synthetic multimodal data. First, broad scope ensures that the generated data covers diverse tasks and modalities, making it applicable to various downstream scenarios. Second, robust cross-modal alignment makes different modalities semantically consistent. Third, high fidelity ensures that the synthetic data maintains realistic details to enhance its reliability. Guided by these principles, we synthesize datasets that: (1) cover a wide range of tasks, modality combinations, and languages, (2) are generated via a deep thinking process within a single pass of a multimodal large language model, and (3) incorporate real-world images with accurate and relevant texts, ensuring fidelity through self-evaluation and refinement. Leveraging these high-quality synthetic and labeled datasets, we train a multimodal multilingual E5 model mmE5. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mmE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB Benchmark and superior multilingual performance on the XTD benchmark. Our codes, datasets and models are released in https://github.com/haon-chen/mmE5.
