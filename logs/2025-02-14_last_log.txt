Our evaluation suite assesses LMMs using three novel metrics that yield six distinct scores. Results reveal that current open-source models, including those with reflection capabilities, still lag behind closed-source models like GPT-4o and Kimi k1.5 in key aspects of chainof-thought reasoning. 1. Introduction The emergence of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) in Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated promising advances in reasoning capabilities, exemplified by the recent OpenAI o1 (OpenAI, 2024a) and DeepSeekR1 (Guo et al., 2025a). By engaging in more deliberate, stepwise reasoning process before reaching final answer, this methodology presents an effective solution in tackling complex scenarios. 1 MME-CoT: Benchmarking Chain-of-Thought in LMMs for Reasoning Quality, Robustness, and Efficiency Figure 2: An Overview of MME-CoT. Our benchmark contains comprehensive CoT evaluation suite with three novel aspects and meticulously curated dataset encompassing six categories. In parallel, the multimodal extensions of LLMs, termed Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across diverse visual domains, e.g., general image recognition (Zhang et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023; Zhang et al., 2024a), temporal video understanding (Li et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023), and 3D geometry perception (Guo et al., 2024b; Xu et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023; Jia et al., 2024). However, to what extent and how much CoT reasoning can benefit multimodal challenges still remains an open question. Although some previous efforts (Zhang et al., 2024c; Yu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024d; Guo et al., 2025b) have been made to evaluate the CoT capabilities of LMMs, their examination is insufficiently systematic and thorough, limiting our understanding of multimodal reasoning and its further development. To bridge this gap, we propose MME-CoT, comprehensive and specialized benchmark for evaluating the CoT reasoning skills within LMMs (Figure 2). Our benchmark spans six fundamental domains: math, science, OCR, logic, space-time, and general scenes, encompassing broad range of CoT-relevant scenarios. Unlike the simplistic metrics used in previous studies, MME-CoT introduces rigorous evaluation framework that delves into the fine-grained CoT process of LMMs, assessing reasoning quality, robustness, and efficiency. Specifically, we address three critical research questions as follows: 2 MME-CoT: Benchmarking Chain-of-Thought in LMMs for Reasoning Quality, Robustness, and Efficiency 1. Is each intermediate CoT step logically valid and faithful without hallucination? The outcome-oriented evaluation paradigm, where most current benchmark adapts, omits the scenario where the model reaches the correct answer through flawed logic or random guess. This causes an illusion of inflated reasoning capabilities in the model. To delve into the reasoning process, we introduce two interpretable metrics to evaluate the Quality of CoT: 1) Recall, which quantifies reasoning informativeness by measuring the proportion of ground-truth solution steps appearing in the response; 2) Precision, which measures faithfulness by evaluating how many of the generated steps are accurate. 2. Does CoT interfere with perception tasks, and to what extent does it enhance reasoning tasks? While existing studies primarily focus on the performance improvements CoT brings to reasoning tasks, they often overlook whether CoT could inadvertently disrupt the models ability to solve perception tasks that require minimal reasoning. To this end, we present the first investigation into the Robustness of CoT in LMMs. Our benchmark incorporates two task categories (perception and reasoning), and employs two distinct prompting strategies (direct answer and step-by-step) to assess two metrics: 1) Stability, which examines whether CoT negatively impacts the models performance on direct perception tasks; 2) Efficacy, which measures the extent to which CoT enhances the models performance on complex reasoning tasks. 3. How can we assess the efficiency of CoT in long reasoning process? Recent o1-like models have distinguished themselves by employing excessively long CoT and reflection steps. This raises critical trade-off question: does this approach strike an optimal balance between accuracy and computational cost? To investigate this, we present the first study on the Efficiency of CoT in LMMs. We evaluate efficiency using two key metrics: 1) Relevance Rate, which assesses the proportion of generated content that contributes to answering the question. 2) Reflection Quality, which analyzes whether each reflection step dri"

This paper introduces Typhoon T1, an open effort to develop an open Thai reasoning model. A reasoning model is a relatively new type of generative model built on top of large language models (LLMs). A reasoning model generates a long chain of thought before arriving at a final answer, an approach found to improve performance on complex tasks. However, details on developing such a model are limited, especially for reasoning models that can generate traces in a low-resource language. Typhoon T1 presents an open effort that dives into the details of developing a reasoning model in a more cost-effective way by leveraging supervised fine-tuning using open datasets, instead of reinforcement learning. This paper shares the details about synthetic data generation and training, as well as our dataset and model weights. Additionally, we provide insights gained from developing a reasoning model that generalizes across domains and is capable of generating reasoning traces in a low-resource language, using Thai as an example. We hope this open effort provides a foundation for further research in this field.

"This paper introduces Typhoon T1, an open effort to develop an open Thai reasoning model. A reasoning model is a relatively new type of generative model built on top of large language models (LLMs). A reasoning model generates a long chain of thought before arriving at a final answer, an approach found to improve performance on complex tasks. However, details on developing such a model are limited, especially for reasoning models that can generate traces in a low-resource language. Typhoon T1 presents an open effort that dives into the details of developing a reasoning model in a more cost-effective way by leveraging supervised fine-tuning using open datasets, instead of reinforcement learning. This paper shares the details about synthetic data generation and training, as well as our dataset and model weights. Additionally, we provide insights gained from developing a reasoning model that generalizes across domains and is capable of generating reasoning traces in a low-resource language, using Thai as an example. We hope this open effort provides a foundation for further research in this field."

Answering questions with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its impact on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) still lacks a systematic assessment and in-depth investigation. In this paper, we introduce MME-CoT, a specialized benchmark evaluating the CoT reasoning performance of LMMs, spanning six domains: math, science, OCR, logic, space-time, and general scenes. As the first comprehensive study in this area, we propose a thorough evaluation suite incorporating three novel metrics that assess the reasoning quality, robustness, and efficiency at a fine-grained level. Leveraging curated high-quality data and a unique evaluation strategy, we conduct an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art LMMs, uncovering several key insights: 1) Models with reflection mechanism demonstrate a superior CoT quality, with Kimi k1.5 outperforming GPT-4o and demonstrating the highest quality results; 2) CoT prompting often degrades LMM performance on perception-heavy tasks, suggesting a potentially harmful overthinking behavior; and 3) Although the CoT quality is high, LMMs with reflection exhibit significant inefficiency in both normal response and self-correction phases. We hope MME-CoT serves as a foundation for advancing multimodal reasoning in LMMs. Project Page: https://mmecot.github.io/

Анализ показывает, что модели с механизмом рефлексии демонстрируют превосходное качество CoT, при этом Kimi k1.5 превосходит GPT-4o. Однако выявлено, что CoT может ухудшать производительность LMM в задачах, требующих восприятия, а модели с рефлексией демонстрируют значительную неэффективность.",
