Text:"3CAD: Large-Scale Real-World 3C Product Dataset for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Enquan Yang1*, Peng Xing2*, Hanyang Sun1, Wenbo Guo1, Yuanwei Ma3, Zechao Li2, Dan Zeng1 1School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University 2Nanjing University of Science and Technology 3Changzhou Microintelligence Corporation {enquanyang,sunhanyang,guowenbo,dzeng}@shu.edu.cn, {xingp ng,zechao.li}@njust.edu.cn, yuanweima@gmail.com 5 2 0 2 9 ] . [ 1 1 6 7 5 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract Industrial anomaly detection achieves progress thanks to datasets such as MVTec-AD and VisA. However, they suffer from limitations in terms of the number of defect samples, types of defects, and availability of real-world scenes. These constraints inhibit researchers from further exploring the performance of industrial detection with higher accuracy. To this end, we propose new large-scale anomaly detection dataset called 3CAD, which is derived from real 3C production lines. Specifically, the proposed 3CAD includes eight different types of manufactured parts, totaling 27,039 highresolution images labeled with pixel-level anomalies. The key features of 3CAD are that it covers anomalous regions of different sizes, multiple anomaly types, and the possibility of multiple anomalous regions and multiple anomaly types per anomaly image. This is the largest and first anomaly detection dataset dedicated to 3C product quality control for community exploration and development. Meanwhile, we introduce simple yet effective framework for unsupervised anomaly detection: Coarse-to-Fine detection paradigm with Recovery Guidance (CFRG). To detect small defect anomalies, the proposed CFRG utilizes coarse-to-fine detection paradigm. Specifically, we utilize heterogeneous distillation model for coarse localization and then fine localization through segmentation model. In addition, to better capture normal patterns, we introduce recovery features as guidance. Finally, we report the results of our CFRG frame"

Industrial anomaly detection achieves progress thanks to datasets such as MVTec-AD and VisA. However, they suf- fer from limitations in terms of the number of defect sam- ples, types of defects, and availability of real-world scenes. These constraints inhibit researchers from further exploring the performance of industrial detection with higher accuracy. To this end, we propose a new large-scale anomaly detection dataset called 3CAD, which is derived from real 3C produc- tion lines. Specifically, the proposed 3CAD includes eight different types of manufactured parts, totaling 27,039 high- resolution images labeled with pixel-level anomalies. The key features of 3CAD are that it covers anomalous regions of different sizes, multiple anomaly types, and the possibility of multiple anomalous regions and multiple anomaly types per anomaly image. This is the largest and first anomaly de- tection dataset dedicated to 3C product quality control for community exploration and development. Meanwhile, we in- troduce a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised anomaly detection: a Coarse-to-Fine detection paradigm with Recovery Guidance (CFRG). To detect small defect anoma- lies, the proposed CFRG utilizes a coarse-to-fine detection paradigm. Specifically, we utilize a heterogeneous distilla- tion model for coarse localization and then fine localiza- tion through a segmentation model. In addition, to better capture normal patterns, we introduce recovery features as guidance. Finally, we report the results of our CFRG frame- work and popular anomaly detection methods on the 3CAD dataset, demonstrating strong competitiveness and providing a highly challenging benchmark to promote the development of the anomaly detection field. Data and code are available: https://github.com/EnquanYang2022/3CAD.

In modern large language models (LLMs), handling very long context lengths presents significant challenges as it causes slower inference speeds and increased memory costs. Additionally, most existing pre-trained LLMs fail to generalize beyond their original training sequence lengths. To enable efficient and practical long-context utilization, we introduce InfiniteHiP, a novel, and practical LLM inference framework that accelerates processing by dynamically eliminating irrelevant context tokens through a modular hierarchical token pruning algorithm. Our method also allows generalization to longer sequences by selectively applying various RoPE adjustment methods according to the internal attention patterns within LLMs. Furthermore, we offload the key-value cache to host memory during inference, significantly reducing GPU memory pressure. As a result, InfiniteHiP enables the processing of up to 3 million tokens on a single L40s 48GB GPU -- 3x larger -- without any permanent loss of context information. Our framework achieves an 18.95x speedup in attention decoding for a 1 million token context without requiring additional training. We implement our method in the SGLang framework and demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality through extensive evaluations.

这篇文章讨论了现代大语言模型（LLMs）处理非常长的上下文时面临的挑战，包括推理速度变慢和内存成本增加。大多数预训练的LLMs无法推广到其原始训练序列长度之外。为了解决这个问题，作者提出了InfiniteHiP，一种新的LLM推理框架，通过动态消除不相关的上下文标记来加速处理。该方法还允许通过选择性应用各种RoPE调整方法来推广到更长的序列。此外，作者在推理过程中将键值缓存卸载到主机内存，显著减少了GPU内存压力。结果是，InfiniteHiP能够在单个L40s 48GB GPU上处理多达300万个标记，而不会永久丢失上下文信息，并且在100万个标记的上下文中实现了18.95倍的注意力解码加速。
