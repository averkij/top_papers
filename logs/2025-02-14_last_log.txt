[ 1 0 2 6 9 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aEncoder-free architectures have been preliminarily explored in the 2D visual domain, yet it remains an open question whether they can be effectively applied to 3D understanding scenarios. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the potential of encoder-free architectures to overcome the challenges of encoderbased 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). These challenges include the failure to adapt to varying point cloud resolutions and the point features from the encoder not meeting the semantic needs of Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify key aspects for 3D LMMs to remove the encoder and enable the LLM to assume the role of the 3D encoder: 1) We propose the LLM-embedded Semantic Encoding strategy in the pre-training stage, exploring the effects of various point cloud self-supervised losses. And we present the Hybrid Semantic Loss to extract highlevel semantics. 2) We introduce the Hierarchical Geometry Aggregation strategy in the instruction tuning stage. This incorporates inductive bias into the LLM early layers to focus on the local details of the point clouds. To the end, we present the first Encoder-free 3D LMM, ENEL, whose 7B model rivals the current state-of-the-art ShapeLLM-13B, achieving 55.0%, 50.92%, and 42.7% on the classification, captioning, and VQA tasks, respectively. Our results demonstrate the encoderfree architecture to be highly promising in the field of 3D LMMs. Code is released at https: //github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/ENEL. 1. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) (Touvron et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2024) have gained *Equal contribution Project Lead 1Northwestern Polytechnical University 2Shanghai AI Laboratory 3The Chinese University of Hong Kong 4Tsinghua University. 1 unprecedented attention for their proficiency in understanding and generating complex language scenarios. Building upon these advances, many recent efforts have been made to develop Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), empowering LLMs with the capability to interpret multimodal information, such as 2D images (Liu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2024a;c;b; Li et al., 2024b) and 3D point clouds (Guo et al., 2023b; Xu et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2023a; Guo* et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2022b; Jia et al., 2024). Mainstream LMMs are typically encoder-based, relying on heavyweight yet powerful multimodal encoders (e.g., CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) for 2D (Liu et al., 2021; Oquab et al., 2023) and I2P-MAE (Zhang et al., 2023a) for 3D). While these pre-trained encoders offer robust multimodal embeddings enriched with pre-existing knowledge, they also introduce challenges that could limit the future advancement of multimodal understanding. Specifically for 3D LMMs, the encoder-based architecture has the following potential drawbacks: (1) Point Cloud Resolution Limitation. 3D encoders are often pre-trained on point cloud data at fixed resolution, such as 1,024 points in PointLLM (Xu et al., 2025). However, during inference, the resolution of point clouds may vary (e.g., 8,192 or 512 points). This difference between training and inference resolutions can result in the loss of spatial information when extracting 3D embeddings, leading to difficulties for LLMs to comprehend, as showcased in Figure 1 (a). (2) Embedding Semantic Discrepancy. 3D encoders are typically pre-trained using self-supervised methods like MAE (Pang et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2024a;b) and contrastive learning (Xie et al., 2020; Qi et al., 2023), but these training objectives may not align with the specific semantic needs of LLMs. In other words, they may not capture the most relevant semantics for LLMs to understand 3D objects, as visualized in Figure 1 (b). Even when projection layer is used to connect 3D encoders with LLMs, simple MLPs are often insufficient for complete semantic transformation. Given these issues, we ask: Is it possible to explore an encoder-free architecture for 3D LMMs, eliminating the 3D encoder and instead integrating its functionality directly within the LLM itself? Exploring the Potential of Encoder-free Architectures in 3D LMMs Figure 1. Issues of encoder-based 3D LMMs. (a) Point Cloud Resolution Limitation. During training, the point cloud size (P.T. size) and point token size (P.T. size) are fixed at 8192 and 512, respectively. And we adjust these two sizes during inference, point cloud size from 2K to 16K and the corresponding point token size from 128 to 2048. We evaluate them on the captioning task of the Objaverse benchmark using GPT-4 scores as the evaluation metric. (b) Embedding Semantic Discrepancy. We visualize the attention scores of the average text token to the point tokens, where red indicates higher values. The point tokens in the encoder-free architecture exhibit stronger textual semantic relevance needed for the LLM. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation into the potential of an encoder-free architecture for 3D LMMs. To minimize external influences and ensure clarity, we use the pioneering and sufficiently concise PointLLM (Xu et al., 2025) as our encoder-based baseline, which consists of two progressive training stages: pretraining and instruction tuning. We evaluate the performance on 3D classification (Deitke et al., 2023) and 3D captioning (Deitke et al., 2023) tasks. Specifically, to remove the encoder while mitigating any performance degradation, we explore solutions to the following two key questions: (1) How can we compensate for the high-level 3D semantics originally extracted by the 3D encoder? In 3D LMMs, the raw point cloud input is first passed through token embedding module for low-level tokenization, before being processed by the main 3D encoder, usually Transformer (Vaswani, 2017), to generate high-level embeddings. Skipping the encoder entirely poses challenge in capturing the complex spatial structures of 3D point clouds. To address this, we propose strategy called LLM-embedded Semantic Encoding in the pre-training stage. First, we adopt simple yet effective token embedding module that captures as much informative semantic content as possible. These 3D tokens are then directly fed into the LLM. Next, we aim to shift the r"

However, simulating established characters presents challenging task for RPLAs, due to the lack of authentic character datasets and nuanced evaluation methods using such data. In this paper, we present CoSER, collection of high-quality dataset, open models, and an evaluation protocol towards effective RPLAs of established characters. The CoSER dataset covers 17,966 characters from 771 renowned books. It provides authentic dialogues with real-world intricacies, as well as diverse data types such as conversation setups, character experiences and internal thoughts. Drawing from acting methodology, we introduce givencircumstance acting for training and evaluating role-playing LLMs, where LLMs sequentially portray multiple characters in book scenes. Using our dataset, we develop CoSER 8B and CoSER 70B, i.e., advanced open role-playing LLMs built on LLaMA-3.1 models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the value of the CoSER dataset for RPLA training, evaluation and retrieval. Moreover, CoSER 70B exhibits state-of-the-art performance surpassing or matching GPT-4o on our evaluation and three existing benchmarks, i.e., achieving 75.80% and 93.47% accuracy on the InCharacter and LifeChoice benchmarks respectively.

Text:"SQuARE: Sequential Question Answering Reasoning Engine for Enhanced Chain-of-Thought in Large Language Models Daniel Fleischer*5 2 0 2 3 1 ] . [ 1 0 9 3 9 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aIn the rapidly evolving field of Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) are tasked with increasingly complex reasoning challenges. Traditional methods like chain-of-thought prompting have shown promise but often fall short in fully leveraging models reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces SQuARE (Sequential Question Answering Reasoning Engine), novel prompting technique designed to improve reasoning through self-interrogation paradigm. Building upon CoT frameworks, SQuARE prompts models to generate and resolve multiple auxiliary questions before tackling the main query, promoting more thorough exploration of various aspects of topic. Our expansive evaluations, conducted with Llama 3 and GPT-4o models across multiple question-answering datasets, demonstrate that SQuARE significantly surpasses traditional CoT prompts and existing rephrase-andrespond methods. By systematically decomposing queries, SQuARE advances LLM capabilities in reasoning tasks. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ IntelLabs/RAG-FiT/tree/square.Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed Natural Language Processing (NLP), excelling in tasks like text generation, machine translation, and dialogue systems (Brown et al., 2020; Kojima et al., 2022). These models owe their flexibility to the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), and benefit from large-scale pretraining followed by fine-tuning or instruction tuning to align with human objectives (Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022). key technique for enhancing these models is chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which has gained notable attention for its ability to *Corresponding author: daniel.fleischer@intel.com 1 Figure 1: The SQuARE methods prompts the model to generate question-answer pairs about the topic and then respond to the original query, having established additional context. improve reasoning by encouraging models to work through problems step by step (Wei et al., 2023). This approach has shown efficacy in complex tasks like multi-step arithmetic and commonsense question answering, by making intermediate processes transparent and facilitating more accurate outcomes (Snell et al., 2024). While some CoT variants explore iterative reasoning, there is still limited exploration of self-interrogation paradigms that prompt models to pose and resolve their own intermediate queries. In this paper, we introduce SQuARE (Sequential Question Answering Reasoning Engine), prompting technique that instructs an LLM to generate and answer multiple sub-questions before addressing the main query. By decomposing queries into iterative steps, SQuARE draws on chain-of-thought frameworks and prior prompting methodologies (Deng et al., 2024) to produce more comprehensive solutions. In extensive evaluations on multiple question-answering datasets using Llama 3 (Grattafiori et al., 2024) (3B and 8B) and GPT-4o (OpenAI et al., 2024), You are helpful question answerer who can provide an answer given question and relevant context. Generate {N} questions based on the given question and context, and shortly answer them. Finally, provide an answer to the original question using what you learned from answering the questions you created. The answer should be short span, just few words. Table 1: Main prompt for the SQuARE technique. SQuARE outperforms chain-of-thought prompts and existing rephrase-and-respond strategies. This work highlights how systematically breaking down queries advances LLM reasoning capabilities.In this section, we introduce the SQuARE technique in more detail. Building upon the foundation laid by Deng et al. (2024), our method alters the system instructions to prompt the model to generate set of question-and-answer pairs. Figure 1 illustrates simple example in which the model receives query, generates two sub-questions and their corresponding answers, and then arrives at correct final solution. The system prompt used by our method is presented in Table 1. The rationale behind SQuARE is to guide the model into an iterative cycle of inquiry and response, encouraging it to explore various facets of topic before forming conclusion. In contrast to standard chain-of-thought prompts, which often present single stream of reasoning, SQuARE nudges the model toward self-interrogation pathways. This design also makes SQuARE relatively straightforward to integrate with other prompting techniques. In practice, can be tuned to balance the thoroughness of exploration with computational cost and response length; our experiments in Section 3 show that even small set of sub-questions can significantly improve the final answers correctness."

Text:"Can this Model Also Recognize Dogs? Zero-Shot Model Search from Weights Jonathan Kahana 1 Or Nathan 1 Eliahu Horwitz 1 Yedid Hoshen 1 5 2 0 2 3 1 ] . [ 1 9 1 6 9 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aWith the increasing numbers of publicly available models, there are probably pretrained, online models for most tasks users require. However, current model search methods are rudimentary, essentially text-based search in the documentation, thus users cannot find the relevant models. This paper presents ProbeLog, method for retrieving classification models that can recognize target concept, such as Dog, without access to model metadata or training data. Differently from previous probing methods, ProbeLog computes descriptor for each output dimension (logit) of each model, by observing its responses on fixed set of inputs (probes). Our method supports both logit-based retrieval (find more logits like this) and zero-shot, text-based retrieval (find all logits corresponding to dogs). As probing-based representations require multiple costly feedforward passes through the model, we develop method, based on collaborative filtering, that reduces the cost of encoding repositories by 3. We demonstrate that ProbeLog achieves high retrieval accuracy, both in real-world and finegrained search tasks and is scalable to full-size repositories. https://jonkahana.github.io/probelog 1. Introduction Neural networks have revolutionized fields like computer vision (He et al., 2016; Dosovitskiy, 2020; Redmon, 2016; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023; Rombach et al., 2022) and natural language processing (Touvron et al., 2023; Devlin, 2018; Vaswani, 2017), becoming indispensable tools for many real-world classification tasks. However, their high training cost leaves users with two suboptimal options: i) invest heavily in computational resources for training or fine-tuning model, ii) settle for general-purpose model that may not suit their task. Now, imagine that instead, one could simply search online for the most accurate model 1School of Computer Science and Engineering The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel. Correspondence to: Jonathan Kahana <jonathan.kahana@mail.huji.ac.il>. Figure 1. Hugging Face Documentation. We analyze the model cards of 1.2M Hugging Face models. We discover that the majority of models are either undocumented or poorly documented. for their specific task and use it directly without additional training. With the rise of large public model repositories, this is becoming feasible. For instance, Hugging Face, the largest existing model repository, hosts over 1 million models, with more than 100, 000 models added monthly. This significantly increases the likelihood of finding suitable public model for most user tasks. The main challenge, however, lies in retrieving the right model for each task. While current model search methods (Shen et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2024) rely on provided metadata or text descriptions, most models in practice are either undocumented or have very limited descriptions (See Fig. 1), which severely limits the ability of these search methods to retrieve suitable models. We aim to search for new models based on their weights, without assuming access to their training data or metadata, as these are often unavailable. More precisely, the goal is to retrieve all classification models capable of recognizing particular concept, such as Dog. For solution to be effective and practical, it must meet several requirements: i) identifying models that recognize the target concept regardless of the other concepts they can detect, ii) being invariant to model output class order, iii) scaling to large model repositories, and iv) supporting text-based search. Using single representation to describe models is suboptimal for this task, as the target concept may only account for small part of 1 Zero-Shot Model Search from Weights Figure 2. Classification Model Search. We present new task of Classification Model Search, where the goal is to find classifiers that can recognize target concept. Concretely, given an input prompt, such as Dog, we wish to retrieve all classifiers that one of their classes is Dog. The search space is large model repository, that contains many models and concepts to search from. The retrieved models can replace model training, increasing accuracy, reducing cost and environmental impact. the representation. Model-level representations are often overly large, suffer from permutation variation and may be insensitive to the target concept. In this paper, we introduce ProbeLog, probing based logitlevel descriptor especially designed for model search. Since our goal is to identify functional property of the model (what it does), the descriptor is functional representation (Herrmann et al., 2024), essentially it describes what the logit does. To compute the ProbeLog descriptor for specific logit in given model, we first query the model with fixed set of pre-determined input samples (probes) and monitor its responses in the specific output dimension. By normalizing the response vector across all probes, we obtain the ProbeLog descriptor. Its dimension is equal to the number of probes. An illustration of ProbeLog descriptors is provided in Fig. 3. Crucially, unlike prior methods for analyzing neural network weights (Lu et al., 2023), our approach represents logits rather than the models, which are more suitable for search. ProbeLog representations enable searching by logit (more like this), but do not allow searching for unseen concepts (find models that recognize dogs). Probably the most convenient way to achieve such zero-shot concept search is to incorporate text. Therefore, we propose to use text alignment model (e.g., CLIP (Radford et al., 2021)) between the probes and target concept name to compute zero-shot ProbeLog representation. After suitable domain normalization, this approach achieves accurate zero-shot search. To make ProbeLog practical for model search, we must address several questions. How does the choice of probes affect the representations? How can we choose effective probes suitable for various concepts? What similarity criteria should be used to compare between ProbeLog representations from two separate models? To answer these questions, in Sec. 5.4 we conduct thorough study of these questions and propose strategies to address them. As another core contribution, we present Collaborative Probing, method to significantly reduce the cost of creating representat"

Encoder-free architectures have been preliminarily explored in the 2D visual domain, yet it remains an open question whether they can be effectively applied to 3D understanding scenarios. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the potential of encoder-free architectures to overcome the challenges of encoder-based 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). These challenges include the failure to adapt to varying point cloud resolutions and the point features from the encoder not meeting the semantic needs of Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify key aspects for 3D LMMs to remove the encoder and enable the LLM to assume the role of the 3D encoder: 1) We propose the LLM-embedded Semantic Encoding strategy in the pre-training stage, exploring the effects of various point cloud self-supervised losses. And we present the Hybrid Semantic Loss to extract high-level semantics. 2) We introduce the Hierarchical Geometry Aggregation strategy in the instruction tuning stage. This incorporates inductive bias into the LLM early layers to focus on the local details of the point clouds. To the end, we present the first Encoder-free 3D LMM, ENEL. Our 7B model rivals the current state-of-the-art model, ShapeLLM-13B, achieving 55.0%, 50.92%, and 42.7% on the classification, captioning, and VQA tasks, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the encoder-free architecture is highly promising for replacing encoder-based architectures in the field of 3D understanding.

Role-playing language agents (RPLAs) have emerged as promising applications of large language models (LLMs). However, simulating established characters presents a challenging task for RPLAs, due to the lack of authentic character datasets and nuanced evaluation methods using such data. In this paper, we present CoSER, a collection of a high-quality dataset, open models, and an evaluation protocol towards effective RPLAs of established characters. The CoSER dataset covers 17,966 characters from 771 renowned books. It provides authentic dialogues with real-world intricacies, as well as diverse data types such as conversation setups, character experiences and internal thoughts. Drawing from acting methodology, we introduce given-circumstance acting for training and evaluating role-playing LLMs, where LLMs sequentially portray multiple characters in book scenes. Using our dataset, we develop CoSER 8B and CoSER 70B, i.e., advanced open role-playing LLMs built on LLaMA-3.1 models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the value of the CoSER dataset for RPLA training, evaluation and retrieval. Moreover, CoSER 70B exhibits state-of-the-art performance surpassing or matching GPT-4o on our evaluation and three existing benchmarks, i.e., achieving 75.80% and 93.47% accuracy on the InCharacter and LifeChoice benchmarks respectively.

"Role-playing language agents (RPLAs) have emerged as promising applications of large language models (LLMs). However, simulating established characters presents a challenging task for RPLAs, due to the lack of authentic character datasets and nuanced evaluation methods using such data. In this paper, we present CoSER, a collection of a high-quality dataset, open models, and an evaluation protocol towards effective RPLAs of established characters. The CoSER dataset covers 17,966 characters from 771 renowned books. It provides authentic dialogues with real-world intricacies, as well as diverse data types such as conversation setups, character experiences and internal thoughts. Drawing from acting methodology, we introduce given-circumstance acting for training and evaluating role-playing LLMs, where LLMs sequentially portray multiple characters in book scenes. Using our dataset, we develop CoSER 8B and CoSER 70B, i.e., advanced open role-playing LLMs built on LLaMA-3.1 models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the value of the CoSER dataset for RPLA training, evaluation and retrieval. Moreover, CoSER 70B exhibits state-of-the-art performance surpassing or matching GPT-4o on our evaluation and three existing benchmarks, i.e., achieving 75.80% and 93.47% accuracy on the InCharacter and LifeChoice benchmarks respectively."

In the rapidly evolving field of Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) are tasked with increasingly complex reasoning challenges. Traditional methods like chain-of-thought prompting have shown promise but often fall short in fully leveraging a model's reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces SQuARE (Sequential Question Answering Reasoning Engine), a novel prompting technique designed to improve reasoning through a self-interrogation paradigm. Building upon CoT frameworks, SQuARE prompts models to generate and resolve multiple auxiliary questions before tackling the main query, promoting a more thorough exploration of various aspects of a topic. Our expansive evaluations, conducted with Llama 3 and GPT-4o models across multiple question-answering datasets, demonstrate that SQuARE significantly surpasses traditional CoT prompts and existing rephrase-and-respond methods. By systematically decomposing queries, SQuARE advances LLM capabilities in reasoning tasks. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/RAG-FiT/tree/square.

With the increasing numbers of publicly available models, there are probably pretrained, online models for most tasks users require. However, current model search methods are rudimentary, essentially a text-based search in the documentation, thus users cannot find the relevant models. This paper presents ProbeLog, a method for retrieving classification models that can recognize a target concept, such as "Dog", without access to model metadata or training data. Differently from previous probing methods, ProbeLog computes a descriptor for each output dimension (logit) of each model, by observing its responses on a fixed set of inputs (probes). Our method supports both logit-based retrieval ("find more logits like this") and zero-shot, text-based retrieval ("find all logits corresponding to dogs"). As probing-based representations require multiple costly feedforward passes through the model, we develop a method, based on collaborative filtering, that reduces the cost of encoding repositories by 3x. We demonstrate that ProbeLog achieves high retrieval accuracy, both in real-world and fine-grained search tasks and is scalable to full-size repositories.
