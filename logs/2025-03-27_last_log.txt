Lee KAIST {prin10517, phillip0701, jh27kim, mhsung}@kaist.ac.kr Figure 1. Unconditional Priors Matter in CFG-Based Conditional Generation. Fine-tuned conditional diffusion models often show drastic degradation in their unconditional priors, adversely affecting conditional generation when using techniques such as CFG [28]. We demonstrate that leveraging diffusion model with richer unconditional prior and combining its unconditional noise prediction with the conditional noise prediction from the fine-tuned model can lead to substantial improvements in conditional generation quality. This is demonstrated across diverse conditional diffusion models including Zero-1-to-3 [46], Versatile Diffusion [64], InstructPix2Pix [7], and DynamiCrafter [62]. "

Text:"5 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 0 2 0 0 2 . 3 0 5 2 : r Gemini Robotics: Bringing AI into the Physical World 1 Gemini Robotics Team, Google DeepMind Recent advancements in large multimodal models have led to the emergence of remarkable generalist capabilities in digital domains, yet their translation to physical agents such as robots remains significant challenge. Generally useful robots need to be able to make sense of the physical world around them, and interact with it competently and safely. This report introduces new family of AI models purposefully designed for robotics and built upon the foundation of Gemini 2.0. We present Gemini Robotics, an advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) generalist model capable of directly controlling robots. Gemini Robotics executes smooth and reactive movements to tackle wide range of complex manipulation tasks while also being robust to variations in object types and positions, handling unseen environments as well as following diverse, open vocabulary instructions. We show that with additional fine-tuning, Gemini Robotics can be specialized to new capabilities including solving long-horizon, highly dexterous tasks like folding an origami fox or playing game of cards, learning new short-horizon tasks from as few as 100 demonstrations, adapting to completely novel robot embodiments including bi-arm platform and high degrees-of-freedom humanoid. This is made possible because Gemini Robotics builds on top of the Gemini Robotics-ER model, the second model we introduce in this work. Gemini Robotics-ER (Embodied Reasoning) extends Geminis multimodal reasoning capabilities into the physical world, with enhanced spatial and temporal understanding. This enables capabilities relevant to robotics including object detection, pointing, trajectory and grasp prediction, as well as 3D understanding in the form of multi-view correspondence and 3D bounding box predictions. We show how this novel combination can support variety of robotics applications, e.g., "

Text:"5 2 0 2 6 2 ] . [ 1 1 0 2 0 2 . 3 0 5 2 : r Open Deep Search: Democratizing Search with Open-source Reasoning Agents Salaheddin Alzubi Creston Brooks Purva Chiniya Edoardo Contente Chiara von Gerlach Lucas Irwin Yihan Jiang Arda Kaz Windsor Nguyen Sewoong Oh Himanshu Tyagi Pramod ViswanathWe introduce Open Deep Search (ODS) to close the increasing gap between the proprietary search AI solutions, such as Perplexitys Sonar Reasoning Pro and OpenAIs GPT-4o Search Preview, and their open-source counterparts. The main innovation introduced in ODS is to augment the reasoning capabilities of the latest open-source LLMs with reasoning agents that can judiciously use web search tools to answer queries. Concretely, ODS consists of two components that work with base LLM chosen by the user: Open Search Tool and Open Reasoning Agent. Open Reasoning Agent interprets the given task and completes it by orchestrating sequence of actions that includes calling tools, one of which is the Open Search Tool. Open Search Tool is novel web search tool that outperforms proprietary counterparts. Together with powerful open-source reasoning LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1, ODS nearly matches and sometimes surpasses the existing state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmarks: SimpleQA and FRAMES. For example, on the FRAMES evaluation benchmark, ODS improves the best existing baseline of the recently released GPT-4o Search Preview by 9.7% in accuracy. ODS is general framework for seamlessly augmenting any LLMsfor example, DeepSeek-R1 that achieves 82.4% on SimpleQA and 30.1% on FRAMESwith search and reasoning capabilities to achieve state-of-the-art performance: 88.3% on SimpleQA and 75.3% on FRAMES.Search AIsSearch engine-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs)combine the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities of LLMs (e.g., [9]) with real-time information retrieval from search engines. This integration addresses the challenge of LLMs static knowledge base enabling LLMs to provide up-to-date and contextually relevant responses. Recent works like [27] have shown that feeding Search Engine Result Page (SERP) APIs as context to an LLM outperforms previous methodologies, such as self-ask. Advances in search AI have been dominated by proprietary solutions such as Google search, Bing, chatGPT search, and Grok. In particular, Perplexity AI [21] has excelled in this market, even threatening mature leaders. However, such closed-source solutions limit transparency, innovation, and entrepreneurship. With the goal of growing community of developers in search AI, harnessing collective talent, fostering innovation, and encouraging entrepreneurship, we introduce Open Deep Search (ODS), an open-source AI search solution that achieves state-of-the-art performance in benchmark evaluations, matching or surpassing those achieved by the best closed-source alternatives. Sentient, University of Washington, Princeton University, UC Berkeley Llama3.1-70B w/o access to the web DeepSeek-R1 GPT-4o Perplexity [21] Perplexity Sonar Reasoning Pro [22] with access to the web GPT-4o Search Preview [17] ODS-v1+DeepSeek-R1 (ours) ODS-v2+DeepSeek-R1 (ours)20.4 82.4 37.5 82.4 85.8 90.0 87.7 88.3 34.3 30.1 50.5 42.4 44.4 65.6 56.7 75.3 Table 1: The proposed open-source search framework of ODS, when used with the open-source reasoning LLM of DeepSeek-R1 [4], achieves performance exceeding that of closed-source stateof-the-art search AI solutions of Perplexity [21], Perplexity Sonar Reasoning Pro [22] on the two popular factuality evaluation Benchmarks of FRAMES [8] and SimpleQA [30]. Compared to GPT4o Search Preview, ODS-v2 has significantly better FRAMES accuracy but slightly worse SimpleQA accuracy. ODS-v1 uses ReAct-based agent (Section 2.2.1) and ODS-v2 uses CodeActbased agent (Section 2.2.2) . Perplexity AI has two search AI products with API accesses: the default Perplexity [21] and Perplexity Sonar Reasoning Pro tailored for complex reasoning tasks [22]. Table 1 shows their performance on two popular evaluation benchmarks of SimpleQA [30] and FRAMES [8]. Note that both versions of the proposed Open Deep Search (when used together with the open-source DeepSeek-R1 model) outperform the Perplexity AIs flagship search AI products. Another important baseline is OpenAIs GPT-4o Search Preview [17] tailored for search AI and released on 3/11/2025. The second version of Open Deep Search, dubbed ODS-v2+DeepSeek-R1, surpasses GPT-4o Search Preview on FRAMES and almost matches it on SimpleQA. To achieve this state-of-the-art performance, we make two innovations in Open Deep Search: Open Search Tool and Open Reasoning Agent. Open Search Tool. Perplexitys and OpenAIs search solutions are closed-source products. Opensource alternatives to Perplexity, such as OpenPerplex [19] and Perplexica [20] are open-source search tools whose output is summarized and fed into an LLM to answer the query of interest. However, these open-source search tools have several weaknesses that leave significant room for improvement. First, OpenPerplex and Perplexica primarily pass raw SERP results as context to the LLM. Additionally, they chunk and rerank snippets based on their relevance to the user query. In contrast, our approach employs more sophisticated search process, which we call Open Search Tool (explained in detail in Section 2.1). Specifically, we rephrase queries when necessary, extract context from the top snippets, and apply chunking and re-ranking to filter content above relevance threshold. This ensures the inclusion of all relevant search result context. Additionally, we implement custom website handling for major APIs such as Wikipedia, ArXiv, and PubMed. Open Reasoning Agent. As shown in Table 1, we provide two versions of Open Reasoning Agent: one based on the ReAct agent [33] and another based on the CodeAct agent [14]. The goals of Open Reasoning Agent are to interpret the query, assess the retrieved context, and use appropriate tools, including Open Search Tool we provide for web search, to answer the query. For details we refer to Section 2.2. Outline. In the next section, we give details of the search AI that we call Open Deep Search. In Section 3, we provide empirical results on the two evaluation benchmarks of SimpleQA and FRAMES, along with an ablation study of various components of ODS."

Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a fundamental technique in training conditional diffusion models. The common practice for CFG-based training is to use a single network to learn both conditional and unconditional noise prediction, with a small dropout rate for conditioning. However, we observe that the joint learning of unconditional noise with limited bandwidth in training results in poor priors for the unconditional case. More importantly, these poor unconditional noise predictions become a serious reason for degrading the quality of conditional generation. Inspired by the fact that most CFG-based conditional models are trained by fine-tuning a base model with better unconditional generation, we first show that simply replacing the unconditional noise in CFG with that predicted by the base model can significantly improve conditional generation. Furthermore, we show that a diffusion model other than the one the fine-tuned model was trained on can be used for unconditional noise replacement. We experimentally verify our claim with a range of CFG-based conditional models for both image and video generation, including Zero-1-to-3, Versatile Diffusion, DiT, DynamiCrafter, and InstructPix2Pix.

"Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a fundamental technique in training conditional diffusion models. The common practice for CFG-based training is to use a single network to learn both conditional and unconditional noise prediction, with a small dropout rate for conditioning. However, we observe that the joint learning of unconditional noise with limited bandwidth in training results in poor priors for the unconditional case. More importantly, these poor unconditional noise predictions become a serious reason for degrading the quality of conditional generation. Inspired by the fact that most CFG-based conditional models are trained by fine-tuning a base model with better unconditional generation, we first show that simply replacing the unconditional noise in CFG with that predicted by the base model can significantly improve conditional generation. Furthermore, we show that a diffusion model other than the one the fine-tuned model was trained on can be used for unconditional noise replacement. We experimentally verify our claim with a range of CFG-based conditional models for both image and video generation, including Zero-1-to-3, Versatile Diffusion, DiT, DynamiCrafter, and InstructPix2Pix."

Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). However, their direct application to ADS is hindered by challenges such as misunderstanding of traffic knowledge, complex road conditions, and diverse states of vehicle. To address these challenges, we propose the use of Knowledge Editing, which enables targeted modifications to a model's behavior without the need for full retraining. Meanwhile, we introduce ADS-Edit, a multimodal knowledge editing dataset specifically designed for ADS, which includes various real-world scenarios, multiple data types, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive experiments and derive several interesting conclusions. We hope that our work will contribute to the further advancement of knowledge editing applications in the field of autonomous driving.

Category-level 3D/6D pose estimation is a crucial step towards comprehensive 3D scene understanding, which would enable a broad range of applications in robotics and embodied AI. Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

Recent advancements in large multimodal models have led to the emergence of remarkable generalist capabilities in digital domains, yet their translation to physical agents such as robots remains a significant challenge. This report introduces a new family of AI models purposefully designed for robotics and built upon the foundation of Gemini 2.0. We present Gemini Robotics, an advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) generalist model capable of directly controlling robots. Gemini Robotics executes smooth and reactive movements to tackle a wide range of complex manipulation tasks while also being robust to variations in object types and positions, handling unseen environments as well as following diverse, open vocabulary instructions. We show that with additional fine-tuning, Gemini Robotics can be specialized to new capabilities including solving long-horizon, highly dexterous tasks, learning new short-horizon tasks from as few as 100 demonstrations and adapting to completely novel robot embodiments. This is made possible because Gemini Robotics builds on top of the Gemini Robotics-ER model, the second model we introduce in this work. Gemini Robotics-ER (Embodied Reasoning) extends Gemini's multimodal reasoning capabilities into the physical world, with enhanced spatial and temporal understanding. This enables capabilities relevant to robotics including object detection, pointing, trajectory and grasp prediction, as well as multi-view correspondence and 3D bounding box predictions. We show how this novel combination can support a variety of robotics applications. We also discuss and address important safety considerations related to this new class of robotics foundation models. The Gemini Robotics family marks a substantial step towards developing general-purpose robots that realizes AI's potential in the physical world.

"Recent advancements in large multimodal models have led to the emergence of remarkable generalist capabilities in digital domains, yet their translation to physical agents such as robots remains a significant challenge. This report introduces a new family of AI models purposefully designed for robotics and built upon the foundation of Gemini 2.0. We present Gemini Robotics, an advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) generalist model capable of directly controlling robots. Gemini Robotics executes smooth and reactive movements to tackle a wide range of complex manipulation tasks while also being robust to variations in object types and positions, handling unseen environments as well as following diverse, open vocabulary instructions. We show that with additional fine-tuning, Gemini Robotics can be specialized to new capabilities including solving long-horizon, highly dexterous tasks, learning new short-horizon tasks from as few as 100 demonstrations and adapting to completely novel robot embodiments. This is made possible because Gemini Robotics builds on top of the Gemini Robotics-ER model, the second model we introduce in this work. Gemini Robotics-ER (Embodied Reasoning) extends Gemini's multimodal reasoning capabilities into the physical world, with enhanced spatial and temporal understanding. This enables capabilities relevant to robotics including object detection, pointing, trajectory and grasp prediction, as well as multi-view correspondence and 3D bounding box predictions. We show how this novel combination can support a variety of robotics applications. We also discuss and address important safety considerations related to this new class of robotics foundation models. The Gemini Robotics family marks a substantial step towards developing general-purpose robots that realizes AI's potential in the physical world."

We introduce Open Deep Search (ODS) to close the increasing gap between the proprietary search AI solutions, such as Perplexity's Sonar Reasoning Pro and OpenAI's GPT-4o Search Preview, and their open-source counterparts. The main innovation introduced in ODS is to augment the reasoning capabilities of the latest open-source LLMs with reasoning agents that can judiciously use web search tools to answer queries. Concretely, ODS consists of two components that work with a base LLM chosen by the user: Open Search Tool and Open Reasoning Agent. Open Reasoning Agent interprets the given task and completes it by orchestrating a sequence of actions that includes calling tools, one of which is the Open Search Tool. Open Search Tool is a novel web search tool that outperforms proprietary counterparts. Together with powerful open-source reasoning LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1, ODS nearly matches and sometimes surpasses the existing state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmarks: SimpleQA and FRAMES. For example, on the FRAMES evaluation benchmark, ODS improves the best existing baseline of the recently released GPT-4o Search Preview by 9.7% in accuracy. ODS is a general framework for seamlessly augmenting any LLMs -- for example, DeepSeek-R1 that achieves 82.4% on SimpleQA and 30.1% on FRAMES -- with search and reasoning capabilities to achieve state-of-the-art performance: 88.3% on SimpleQA and 75.3% on FRAMES.

Estimating motion in videos is an essential computer vision problem with many downstream applications, including controllable video generation and robotics. Current solutions are primarily trained using synthetic data or require tuning of situation-specific heuristics, which inherently limits these models' capabilities in real-world contexts. Despite recent developments in large-scale self-supervised learning from videos, leveraging such representations for motion estimation remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we develop Opt-CWM, a self-supervised technique for flow and occlusion estimation from a pre-trained next-frame prediction model. Opt-CWM works by learning to optimize counterfactual probes that extract motion information from a base video model, avoiding the need for fixed heuristics while training on unrestricted video inputs. We achieve state-of-the-art performance for motion estimation on real-world videos while requiring no labeled data.

Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the field of video generation. However, their iterative denoising nature requires a large number of inference steps to generate a video, which is slow and computationally expensive. In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis of the challenges present in existing diffusion distillation methods and propose a novel efficient method, namely AccVideo, to reduce the inference steps for accelerating video diffusion models with synthetic dataset. We leverage the pretrained video diffusion model to generate multiple valid denoising trajectories as our synthetic dataset, which eliminates the use of useless data points during distillation. Based on the synthetic dataset, we design a trajectory-based few-step guidance that utilizes key data points from the denoising trajectories to learn the noise-to-video mapping, enabling video generation in fewer steps. Furthermore, since the synthetic dataset captures the data distribution at each diffusion timestep, we introduce an adversarial training strategy to align the output distribution of the student model with that of our synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing the video quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves 8.5x improvements in generation speed compared to the teacher model while maintaining comparable performance. Compared to previous accelerating methods, our approach is capable of generating videos with higher quality and resolution, i.e., 5-seconds, 720x1280, 24fps.

Compared to previous accelerating methods, our approach is capable of generating videos with higher quality and resolution, i.e., 5-seconds, 720x1280, 24fps."

"Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the field of video generation. However, their iterative denoising nature requires a large number of inference steps to generate a video, which is slow and computationally expensive. In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis of the challenges present in existing diffusion distillation methods and propose a novel efficient method, namely AccVideo, to reduce the inference steps for accelerating video diffusion models with synthetic dataset. We leverage the pretrained video diffusion model to generate multiple valid denoising trajectories as our synthetic dataset, which eliminates the use of useless data points during distillation. Based on the synthetic dataset, we design a trajectory-based few-step guidance that utilizes key data points from the denoising trajectories to learn the noise-to-video mapping, enabling video generation in fewer steps. Furthermore, since the synthetic dataset captures the data distribution at each diffusion timestep, we introduce an adversarial training strategy to align the output distribution of the student model with that of our synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing the video quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves 8.5x improvements in generation speed compared to the teacher model while maintaining comparable performance. Compared to previous accelerating methods, our approach is capable of generating videos with higher quality and resolution, i.e., 5-seconds, 720x1280, 24fps."
