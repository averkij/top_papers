Text:"2025-03-27 Qwen2.5-Omni Technical Report Qwen Team https://huggingface.co/Qwen https://modelscope.cn/organization/qwen https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-OmniIn this report, we present Qwen2.5-Omni, an end-to-end multimodal model designed to perceive diverse modalities, including text, images, audio, and video, while simultaneously generating text and natural speech responses in streaming manner. To enable the streaming of multimodal information inputs, both audio and visual encoders utilize block-wise processing approach. This strategy effectively decouples the handling of long sequences of multimodal data, assigning the perceptual responsibilities to the multimodal encoder and entrusting the modeling of extended sequences to large language model. Such division of labor enhances the fusion of different modalities via the shared attention mechanism. To synchronize the timestamps of video inputs with audio, we organize the audio and video sequentially in an interleaved manner and propose novel position embedding approach, named TMRoPE (Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE). To concurrently generate text and speech while avoiding interference between the two modalities, we propose Thinker-Talker architecture. In this framework, Thinker functions as large language model tasked with text generation, while Talker is dual-track autoregressive model that directly utilizes the hidden representations from the Thinker to produce audio tokens as output. Both the Thinker and Talker models are designed to be trained and inferred in an end-to-end manner. For decoding audio tokens in streaming manner, we introduce sliding-window DiT that restricts the receptive field, aiming to reduce the initial package delay. Qwen2.5-Omni is comparable with similarly sized Qwen2.5-VL and outperforms Qwen2-Audio. Furthermore, Qwen2.5-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal benchmarks like Omni-Bench. Notably, Qwen2.5-Omni performance in end-to-end speech instruction following is comparable to its capabilities with text inputs, as evidenced by benchmarks such as MMLU and GSM8K. As for speech generation, Qwen2.5-Omnis streaming Talker outperforms most existing streaming and non-streaming alternatives in robustness and naturalness. 5 2 0 2 6 2 ] . [ 1 5 1 2 0 2 . 3 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Qwen2.5-Omni is unified end-to-end model capable of processing multiple modalities, such as text, audio, image and video, and generating real-time text or speech response. Based on these features, Qwen2.5-Omni supports wide range of tasks, including but not limited to voice dialogue, video dialogue, and video reasoning.In daily life, humans are capable of simultaneously perceiving the visual and auditory information around them. After processing this information through the brain, they express feedback through writing, vocalization, or using tools (and physical actions), thereby engaging in information exchange In recent years, general artificial with various organisms in the world and exhibiting intelligence. intelligence has become increasingly visible, largely due to advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023; 2024; Gemini Team, 2024; Anthropic, 2023a;b; 2024; Bai et al., 2023a; Yang et al., 2024a; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Dubey et al., 2024a). These models, trained on vast amounts of textual data, represent high-level discrete representation created by humans, showcasing the ability to solve complex problems and learn rapidly. Furthermore, in the realm of understanding, Language-Audio-Language Models (LALMs) (OpenAI, 2024; Tang et al., 2024; Chu et al., 2023b; 2024b) and Language-Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) (Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023b; Dai et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2023b; OpenAI., 2023; Gemini Team, 2024) have helped LLMs to further extend auditory and visual capabilities in an end-to-end manner. However, efficiently unifying all these different understanding modalities in an end-to-end fashion, utilizing as much data as possible, and providing responses in both text and speech streams akin to human communication still presents significant challenge. The development of unified and intelligent omni-model requires careful consideration of several key factors. First, it is crucial to implement systematic method for the joint training of various modalities, including text, images, videos, and audio, to foster mutual enhancement among them. This alignment is particularly important for video content, where synchronization of the temporal aspects of audio and visual signals is necessary. Second, it is essential to manage potential interference among outputs from different modalities, ensuring that the training processes for outputs such as text and voice tokens do not disrupt each other. Finally, there is need to explore architectural designs that enable realtime understanding of multimodal information and allow for efficient audio output streaming, thereby reducing initial latency. In this report, we introduce Qwen2.5-Omni, unified single model capable of processing multiple modalities and generating text and natural speech responses simultaneously in streaming format. To tackle the first challenge, we propose novel position embedding approach, named TMRoPE (Timealigned Multimodal RoPE). We organize these audio and video frames in an interleaved structure to represent video sequences in time order. For the second challenge, we present Thinker-Talker architecture, wherein Thinker is tasked with text generation while the Talker focuses on generating streaming speech tokens. Talker receives high-level representations directly from Thinker. This design is inspired by the way humans utilize different organs to produce various signals, which are simultaneously coordinated through the same neural networks. As result, Thinker-Talker architecture is end-to-end jointly trained, with each component dedicated to generating distinct signals. To address the challenges associated with streaming and to facilitate the pre-filling necessary for real-time comprehension of multimodal signals, we propose modifications to all multimodal encoders by adopting block-wise streaming processing approach. In order to support streaming speech generation, we implement dual-track autoregressive model that generates speech tokens, alongside DiT model which converts these tokens into waveforms, thereby enabling streaming audio generatio"

In this report, we present Qwen2.5-Omni, an end-to-end multimodal model designed to perceive diverse modalities, including text, images, audio, and video, while simultaneously generating text and natural speech responses in a streaming manner. To enable the streaming of multimodal information inputs, both audio and visual encoders utilize a block-wise processing approach. To synchronize the timestamps of video inputs with audio, we organize the audio and video sequentially in an interleaved manner and propose a novel position embedding approach, named TMRoPE(Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE). To concurrently generate text and speech while avoiding interference between the two modalities, we propose Thinker-Talker architecture. In this framework, Thinker functions as a large language model tasked with text generation, while Talker is a dual-track autoregressive model that directly utilizes the hidden representations from the Thinker to produce audio tokens as output. Both the Thinker and Talker models are designed to be trained and inferred in an end-to-end manner. For decoding audio tokens in a streaming manner, we introduce a sliding-window DiT that restricts the receptive field, aiming to reduce the initial package delay. Qwen2.5-Omni is comparable with the similarly sized Qwen2.5-VL and outperforms Qwen2-Audio. Furthermore, Qwen2.5-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal benchmarks like Omni-Bench. Notably, Qwen2.5-Omni's performance in end-to-end speech instruction following is comparable to its capabilities with text inputs, as evidenced by benchmarks such as MMLU and GSM8K. As for speech generation, Qwen2.5-Omni's streaming Talker outperforms most existing streaming and non-streaming alternatives in robustness and naturalness.
