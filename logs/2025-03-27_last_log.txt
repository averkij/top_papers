Text:"5 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 6 8 7 9 1 . 3 0 5 2 : r 2025-03Gemma 3 Technical Report Gemma Team, Google DeepMind1 We introduce Gemma 3, multimodal addition to the Gemma family of lightweight open models, ranging in scale from 1 to 27 billion parameters. This version introduces vision understanding abilities, wider coverage of languages and longer context at least 128K tokens. We also change the architecture of the model to reduce the KV-cache memory that tends to explode with long context. This is achieved by increasing the ratio of local to global attention layers, and keeping the span on local attention short. The Gemma 3 models are trained with distillation and achieve superior performance to Gemma 2 for both pre-trained and instruction finetuned versions. In particular, our novel post-training recipe significantly improves the math, chat, instruction-following and multilingual abilities, making Gemma34B-IT competitive with Gemma2-27B-IT and Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro across benchmarks. We release all our models to the community. 1. Introduction We present the newest version of Gemma open language models (Gemma Team, 2024a), codesigned with the family of Gemini frontier models (Gemini Team, 2023). This new version comes in sizes comparable to Gemma 2 (Gemma Team, 2024b), with the addition of 1B model. These models are designed to run on standard consumer-grade hardware such as phones, laptops, and high-end GPUs. This version comes with several new abilities to the Gemma family; namely, multimodality, long context, and multilinguality, while preserving or surpassing the performance of prior versions. In terms of multimodality, most Gemma 3 models are compatible with tailored version of the SigLIP vision encoder (Zhai et al., 2023). The language models treat images as sequence of soft tokens encoded by SigLIP. We reduce the inference cost of image processing by condensing the vision embeddings into fixed size of 256 vectors. The encoder works at fixed resolu"

We introduce Gemma 3, a multimodal addition to the Gemma family of lightweight open models, ranging in scale from 1 to 27 billion parameters. This version introduces vision understanding abilities, a wider coverage of languages and longer context - at least 128K tokens. We also change the architecture of the model to reduce the KV-cache memory that tends to explode with long context. This is achieved by increasing the ratio of local to global attention layers, and keeping the span on local attention short. The Gemma 3 models are trained with distillation and achieve superior performance to Gemma 2 for both pre-trained and instruction finetuned versions. In particular, our novel post-training recipe significantly improves the math, chat, instruction-following and multilingual abilities, making Gemma3-4B-IT competitive with Gemma2-27B-IT and Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro across benchmarks. We release all our models to the community.
