The transition from System 1 to System 2 reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has marked significant advancements in handling complex tasks through deliberate, iterative thinking. However, this progress often comes at the cost of efficiency, as models tend to overthink, generating redundant rea...

[27.03.2025 21:10] Abstract 20. Estimating motion in videos is an essential computer vision problem with many downstream applications, including controllable video generation and robotics. Current solutions are primarily trained using synthetic data or require tuning of situation-specific heuristics, which inherently limits these ...

[27.03.2025 21:10] Abstract 21. Knowledge distillation can be a cost-effective technique to distill knowledge in Large Language Models, if the teacher output logits can be pre-computed and cached. However, successfully applying this to pre-training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we prove that naive approaches for sparse...

[27.03.2025 21:10] Abstract 22. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component of large language model (LLM) post-training. However, existing on-policy algorithms used for post-training are inherently incompatible with the use of experience replay buffers, which can be populated scalably by distributed off-policy actors to en...

[27.03.2025 21:10] Abstract 23. Document structure analysis, aka document layout analysis, is crucial for understanding both the physical layout and logical structure of documents, serving information retrieval, document summarization, knowledge extraction, etc. Hierarchical Document Structure Analysis (HDSA) specifically aims to ...

[27.03.2025 21:10] Abstract 24. Writing Assistants (e.g., Grammarly, Microsoft Copilot) traditionally generate diverse image captions by employing syntactic and semantic variations to describe image components. However, human-written captions prioritize conveying a central message alongside visual descriptions using pragmatic cues...

[27.03.2025 21:10] Abstract 25. Score-based or diffusion models generate high-quality tabular data, surpassing GAN-based and VAE-based models. However, these methods require substantial training time. In this paper, we introduce RecTable, which uses the rectified flow modeling, applied in such as text-to-image generation and text-...

[27.03.2025 21:10] Abstract 26. Breast cancer survival prediction in computational pathology presents a remarkable challenge due to tumor heterogeneity. For instance, different regions of the same tumor in the pathology image can show distinct morphological and molecular characteristics. This makes it difficult to extract represen...
