Text:"FlowEdit: Inversion-Free Text-Based Editing Using Pre-Trained Flow Models Inbar Huberman-Spiegelglas Technion Israel Institute of Technology 4 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 9 2 6 8 0 . 2 1 4 2 : r Figure 1. FlowEdit. We present an inversion-free, optimization-free and model agnostic method for text-based image editing using pretrained flow models. As opposed to the editing-by-inversion paradigm, FlowEdit constructs an ODE that directly maps the source image distribution to the target image distribution (corresponding to the source and target prompts). This ODE achieves lower transport cost and thus leads to better structure preservation, achieving state of the art results on complex editing tasks. From left to right, top to bottom, the first five images were obtained with FLUX and the rest with Stable Diffusion 3. Text indicates changes in the prompts. "

Editing real images using a pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion/flow model often involves inverting the image into its corresponding noise map. However, inversion by itself is typically insufficient for obtaining satisfactory results, and therefore many methods additionally intervene in the sampling process. Such methods achieve improved results but are not seamlessly transferable between model architectures. Here, we introduce FlowEdit, a text-based editing method for pre-trained T2I flow models, which is inversion-free, optimization-free and model agnostic. Our method constructs an ODE that directly maps between the source and target distributions (corresponding to the source and target text prompts) and achieves a lower transport cost than the inversion approach. This leads to state-of-the-art results, as we illustrate with Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX. Code and examples are available on the project's webpage.

Text-driven style transfer aims to merge the style of a reference image with content described by a text prompt. Recent advancements in text-to-image models have improved the nuance of style transformations, yet significant challenges remain, particularly with overfitting to reference styles, limiting stylistic control, and misaligning with textual content. In this paper, we propose three complementary strategies to address these issues. First, we introduce a cross-modal Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) mechanism for better integration of style and text features, enhancing alignment. Second, we develop a Style-based Classifier-Free Guidance (SCFG) approach that enables selective control over stylistic elements, reducing irrelevant influences. Finally, we incorporate a teacher model during early generation stages to stabilize spatial layouts and mitigate artifacts. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in style transfer quality and alignment with textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach can be integrated into existing style transfer frameworks without fine-tuning.
