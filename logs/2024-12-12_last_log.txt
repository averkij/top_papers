Experimental re- *Equal contribution Corresponding author sults on both object-level and scene-level reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-ofthe-art approaches with comparable or smaller model sizes, achieving notable improvements in representing fine details. 1. Introduction 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) [13] has been massive success in high-quality 3D scene reconstruction and realtime novel view synthesis, representing 3D scene with set of learnable Gaussian primitives and exploiting fast differentiable rasterization pipeline. Since its introduction, numerous studies have explored 3D-GS as versatile 3D representation with various applications extending beyond the per-scene optimization. One notable example is generalized feed-forward Gaussian models [3, 5, 7, 29, 30, 37, 41, 42, 45], which generate 3D Gaussian primitives to reconstruct 3D scenes or objects in single forward pass. By leveraging 3D prior knowledge learned from large multiview datasets (e.g., Objaverse [8, 9], RE10K [46]), these models can reconstruct the 3D scene or objects with the generated 3D Gaussians from only single or few images. Figure 2. Generative Densification overview. We selectively densifies the top Gaussians with large view-space positional gradients. While effective and promising, the feed-forward Gaussian models often face challenges in capturing highfrequency details primarily due to the limited number of Gaussians and the lack of densification strategy tailored for these approaches. One possible solution is to generate more Gaussians, but this does not fully address the problem. For example, in the pixel-aligned Gaussian model [3], widely adopted architecture in the feed-forward models (see Sec. 2 for details), we can predict multiple Gaussians per pixel. However, this strategy uniformly increases the number of Gaussians across the entire 3D space, resulting in an excess of unnecessary small Gaussians that may degrade rendering quality and speed. Ideally, the scene details should be represented by numerous small Gaussians, while smoother regions can be covered by few large Gaussians. In per-scene 3D-GS optimization, an adaptive densification strategy selectively increases the number of Gaussians to better reconstruct complex 3D geometry and fine details. Specifically, every few optimization steps, it densifies only the Gaussians with large view-space positional gradients, replicating the existing Gaussians or splitting them into smaller ones when more Gaussians are required. Through repeated optimization and densification processes, the Gaussians gradually become non-uniformly distributed, with numerous small Gaussians concentrated in detailed areas and few large Gaussians scattered across smooth regions. This simple heuristic algorithm has demonstrated its effectiveness across various real-world scenes and objects. straightforward approach to extend the densification strategy to the feed-forward Gaussian models is to fine-tune the output Gaussians from the feed-forward models using the original 3D-GS optimization and densification procedure. However, directly applying the densification strategy used in per-scene optimization scenarios presents several challenges. For example, it demands hundreds and thousands of optimization steps to converge and reconstruct the fine details, which significantly reduces generation speed. Additionally, the per-scene 3D-GS optimization usually assumes many input images from various viewpoints, whereas the feed-forward models typically take just few views or even single view image. Thus, the densification and extensive optimization to few view images can easily lead to overfitting, compromising the feed-forward models ability to generalize and synthesize novel views effectively. In this paper, we propose Generative Densification (GD), an efficient generative densification strategy for generalized feed-forward Gaussian models, which is designed in accordance with the following principles: 1) adaptability, allowing the model to distinguish Gaussians that requires densification and those do not; and 2) generalizability, enabling the model to learn and leverage prior knowledge from large multi-view datasets. Inspired by the 3D-GS densification strategy, our approach leverages view-space positional gradients to identify where additional Gaussians are needed. We selectively densify the top Gaussians with large gradients, and the remaining (non-selected) Gaussians are used together with the densified ones to render high-fidelity images  (Fig. 2)  . Unlike the 3D-GS densification strategy, the proposed GD densifies the selected Gaussians based on the learned prior knowledge for the purpose of generalizable 3D reconstruction. More specifically, GD densifies the feature representations from the feed-forward models rather than the actual Gaussians, and th"

Vision-language models have made significant strides recently, demonstrating superior performance across a range of tasks, e.g. optical character recognition and complex diagram analysis. Building on this trend, we introduce a new vision-language model, POINTS1.5, designed to excel in various real-world applications. POINTS1.5 is an enhancement of POINTS1.0 and incorporates several key innovations: i) We replace the original CLIP vision encoder, which had a fixed image resolution, with a NaViT-style vision encoder that supports native dynamic high resolution. This allows POINTS1.5 to process images of any resolution without needing to split them into tiles. ii) We add bilingual support to POINTS1.5, significantly enhancing its capability in Chinese. Due to the scarcity of open-source Chinese datasets for vision-language models, we collect numerous images from the Internet and annotate them using a combination of manual and automatic methods. iii) We propose a set of rigorous filtering methods for visual instruction tuning datasets. We comprehensively evaluate all these filtering methods, and choose the most effective ones to obtain the final visual instruction tuning set.

"Vision-language models have made significant strides recently, demonstrating superior performance across a range of tasks, e.g. optical character recognition and complex diagram analysis. Building on this trend, we introduce a new vision-language model, POINTS1.5, designed to excel in various real-world applications. POINTS1.5 is an enhancement of POINTS1.0 and incorporates several key innovations: i) We replace the original CLIP vision encoder, which had a fixed image resolution, with a NaViT-style vision encoder that supports native dynamic high resolution. This allows POINTS1.5 to process images of any resolution without needing to split them into tiles. ii) We add bilingual support to POINTS1.5, significantly enhancing its capability in Chinese. Due to the scarcity of open-source Chinese datasets for vision-language models, we collect numerous images from the Internet and annotate them using a combination of manual and automatic methods. iii) We propose a set of rigorous filtering methods for visual instruction tuning datasets.
