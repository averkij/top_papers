The resulting model surpasses the accuracy of similarly-sized models while achieving 2x faster inference, significantly advancing the Pareto frontier.Recent advances in language modeling have led to the development of hybrid architectures that combine Transformer layers [1] with State Space Models (SSMs) [2, 3]. These hybrid models leverage the complementary strengths of both approaches: Transformers excel at capturing global dependencies through self-attention mechanisms, while SSMs provide efficient sequence processing with 𝑂(𝑁 ) scaling during training and 𝑂(1) cache size during inference. Mamba [2, 3] in particular is popular SSM designed for efficient sequence modeling with linear-time complexity and support for long contexts and is often the preferred choice for non-attention layers in hybrid architectures. Despite their improved efficiency, many hybrid LLMs remain incredibly large, often spanning billions of parameters - this motivates the need for efficiently creating smaller hybrid models suitable for deployment in various resource-constrained environments. Model pruningthe removal of redundant parameters while preserving accuracyhas recently emerged as promising approach for compressing LLMs. In particular, methods that combine structured pruning (i.e., pruning of entire parameter blocks such as neurons, attention heads, etc.) with knowledge distillation [4] have proven effective at simultaneously reducing model memory footprint while improving runtime performance and accuracy [5]. While pruning techniques have been extensively studied for Transformer architectures [5, 6, 7], their application to hybrid models remains significantly underexplored. Some early work on Mamba and SSM pruning includes Mamba-Shredder [8], which removes the entire state space module from the Mamba layers, leaving only linear projections and convolution layer. In concurrent study, Ghattas et al. [9] proposed method for pruning Mamba architectures by focusing on three aspects: state space dimension reduction, Mamba head dimension pruning, and Mamba head merging. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work on SSM/Mamba pruning presents holistic compression strategy that simultaneously combines various aspects of SSM pruning with the pruning of other network components such as FFN neurons, embedding channels, and network depth; we believe such an approach is essential for obtaining the best combination of runtime performance and model accuracy. In this paper, we introduce novel pruning method for Mamba architectures that compresses multiple dimensions (Mamba heads, head channels). We also present unified pruning recipe that combines Mamba pruning with FFN, embedding dimension, and layer pruning to maximize accuracy and runtime performance. This paper makes the following key contributions: Introduces group-aware pruning method for Mamba layers that preserves SSM block structure and sequence modeling capabilities.

Presents findings on the sensitivity of Mamba to pruning, along with block components accuracy-throughput trade-offs when combined with pruning of other network components. Utilizes the proposed hybrid pruning recipe to compress the Nemotron-H 8B model to 4B parameters through pruning and knowledge distillation. The resulting model requires up to 40x fewer training tokens compared to others in the same size range. It also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmarks, along with 2x speedup in throughput compared to models of similar size, significantly pushing the Pareto frontier.State Space Models (SSMs). SSMs are class of sequence models that process inputs through hidden states evolving over time [3]. The general form of an SSM is given by: ℎ𝑡 = 𝐴ℎ𝑡1 + 𝐵𝑥𝑡 𝑦𝑡 = 𝐶 ℎ𝑡 + 𝐷𝑥𝑡 (1) (2) Here, ℎ𝑡 represents the hidden state, 𝑥𝑡 the input, 𝑦𝑡 the output, and 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶, and 𝐷 are parameter matrices. The above equations describe linear time-invariant (LTI) SSMs, where the parameters remain constant across timesteps. The Mamba architecture [3] introduced selective SSM variant with time-varying parameters: ℎ𝑡 = 𝐴𝑡ℎ𝑡1 + 𝐵𝑡𝑥𝑡 𝑦𝑡 = 𝐶 𝑡 ℎ𝑡 + 𝐷𝑡𝑥𝑡 (3) (4) This selective mechanism allows the model to adapt dynamically to the input sequence, improving performance on complex tasks. Mamba2 [3] builds upon the selective SSM framework and introduces several enhancements to improve efficiency and scalability. It leverages the Structured State Space Duality (SSD), which connects SSMs and attention mechanisms through semi-se"

Because large language models are expensive to pretrain on different datasets, using smaller-scale experiments to decide on data is crucial for reducing costs. Which benchmarks and methods of making decisions from observed performance at small scale most accurately predict the datasets that yield the best large models? To empower open exploration of this question, we release models, data, and evaluations in DataDecide -- the most extensive open suite of models over differences in data and scale. We conduct controlled pretraining experiments across 25 corpora with differing sources, deduplication, and filtering up to 100B tokens, model sizes up to 1B parameters, and 3 random seeds. We find that the ranking of models at a single, small size (e.g., 150M parameters) is a strong baseline for predicting best models at our larger target scale (1B) (~80% of com parisons correct). No scaling law methods among 8 baselines exceed the compute-decision frontier of single-scale predictions, but DataDecide can measure improvement in future scaling laws. We also identify that using continuous likelihood metrics as proxies in small experiments makes benchmarks including MMLU, ARC, HellaSwag, MBPP, and HumanEval >80% predictable at the target 1B scale with just 0.01% of the compute.

"Because large language models are expensive to pretrain on different datasets, using smaller-scale experiments to decide on data is crucial for reducing costs. Which benchmarks and methods of making decisions from observed performance at small scale most accurately predict the datasets that yield the best large models? To empower open exploration of this question, we release models, data, and evaluations in DataDecide -- the most extensive open suite of models over differences in data and scale. We conduct controlled pretraining experiments across 25 corpora with differing sources, deduplication, and filtering up to 100B tokens, model sizes up to 1B parameters, and 3 random seeds. We find that the ranking of models at a single, small size (e.g., 150M parameters) is a strong baseline for predicting best models at our larger target scale (1B) (~80% of com parisons correct). No scaling law methods among 8 baselines exceed the compute-decision frontier of single-scale predictions, but DataDecide can measure improvement in future scaling laws. We also identify that using continuous likelihood metrics as proxies in small experiments makes benchmarks including MMLU, ARC, HellaSwag, MBPP, and HumanEval >80% predictable at the target 1B scale with just 0.01% of the compute."

Hybrid LLM architectures that combine Attention and State Space Models (SSMs) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and runtime performance. Recent work has demonstrated that applying compression and distillation to Attention-only models yields smaller, more accurate models at a fraction of the training cost. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of compressing Hybrid architectures. We introduce a novel group-aware pruning strategy that preserves the structural integrity of SSM blocks and their sequence modeling capabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrate the necessity of such SSM pruning to achieve improved accuracy and inference speed compared to traditional approaches. Our compression recipe combines SSM, FFN, embedding dimension, and layer pruning, followed by knowledge distillation-based retraining, similar to the MINITRON technique. Using this approach, we compress the Nemotron-H 8B Hybrid model down to 4B parameters with up to 40x fewer training tokens. The resulting model surpasses the accuracy of similarly-sized models while achieving 2x faster inference, significantly advancing the Pareto frontier.
