Text:"5 2 0 2 5 1 ] . [ 1 3 4 3 1 1 . 4 0 5 2 : r Minimalist Approach to LLM Reasoning: from Rejection Sampling to Reinforce Wei Xiong Jiarui Yao Yuhui Xu Bo Pang Lei Wang Doyen Sahoo Junnan Li Nan Jiang Tong Zhang Caiming Xiong Hanze Dong Salesforce AI Research University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Abstract Reinforcement learning (RL) has become prevailing approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Among recent methods, GRPO stands out for its empirical success in training models such as DeepSeek-R1, yet the sources of its effectiveness remain poorly understood. In this work, we revisit GRPO from reinforce-like algorithm perspective and analyze its core components. Surprisingly, we find that simple rejection sampling baseline, RAFT, which trains only on positively rewarded samples, yields competitive performance than GRPO and PPO. Our ablation studies reveal that GRPOs main advantage arises from discarding prompts with entirely incorrect responses, rather than from its reward normalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Rej, minimal extension of policy gradient that filters both entirely incorrect and entirely correct samples. Reinforce-Rej improves KL efficiency and stability, serving as lightweight yet effective alternative to more complex RL algorithms. We advocate RAFT as robust and interpretable baseline, and suggest that future advances should focus on more principled designs for incorporating negative samples, rather than relying on them indiscriminately. Our findings provide guidance for future work in reward-based LLM post-training. We investigate reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in the context of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with verifiable rewards. Our focus is on mathematical reasoning tasks, which have recently received significant attention following the release of models such as OpenAIs O1 Model (Jaech et al., 2024) and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025).

Embedded Representation Warmup (ERW). Throughout the training process, we demonstrate that incorporating representations at the early stages is highly beneficial. To this end, we propose representation warmup stage that employs representation alignment loss to integrate representations from models such as Dinov2 [38] into the ERW. This initialized representation region is subsequently embedded into the diffusion model pipeline, providing strong starting point for training. Our ERW method thus enhances both efficiency and effectiveness, leading to faster convergence and superior performance compared to the REPA [54] method, thereby establishing new state-of-the-art. "

Both tracks introduce new, more challenging datasets designed to better reflect real-world scenarios. Through detailed evaluation and analysis, the challenge offers valuable insights into the current state-of-the-art and emerging trends in complex video segmentation. More information can be found on the workshop website: https://pvuw.github.io/. 1. Introduction Pixel-level understanding of dynamic and complex visual scenes remains core yet unresolved problem in computer vision [9, 10, 19, 23, 34, 42]. While traditional research has predominantly focused on semantic segmentation within static images [57], such approaches fall short in capturing the temporal continuity of the real world. In contrast, video segmentation [9, 10, 20, 21, 36, 37] offers more realistic framework, aligning better with applications that demand spatiotemporal reasoningsuch as autonomous driving, aerial navigation, and mobile video editing. These use cases underscore growing shift toward scene under- *Authors are CVPR 2025 PVUW Challenge organizers. All others are challenge participants from the top-3 teams of MOSE and MeViS tracks.

To advance research in this direction, we introduce the Pixel-level Video Understanding in the Wild (PVUW) workshop, which emphasizes the challenges posed by unconstrained, real-world environments [13]. PVUW seeks to narrow the gap between static and dynamic scene understanding, encouraging the development of robust algorithms that can generalize across diverse, time-varying visual conditions. Through this initiative, we aim to catalyze innovation toward deploying perception systems capable of reliable operation in the wild. Recent advances in Large Language Models and multimodal LLMs have significantly reshaped computer vision [35]. Alongside, foundational models like SAM2 [34] have leveraged large-scale data to achieve strong generalization. Notably, progress in tasks such as Video Object Segmentation (VOS) [10] and Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) [9] highlights the fields continued momentum toward more robust and unified vision systems. Building on these developments, the goal of our workshop and challenge is to keep pace with cutting-edge research, offer challenging, yet realistic benchmark to evaluate state-of-the-art models, and provide valuable insights into both the current trends and future directions of video understanding. Following past challenges, we aim to continuously provide challenging and diverse benchmarking data that are taken in real world, and in this year, we have added more latest data that are first time released. 2. The PVUW 2025 Challenge This year, we center our challenge around two focused tracks: the MOSE Track, which benchmarks advanced VOS methods in complex and densely populated scenes; and the MeViS Track, which evaluates models on language-guided 1 Table 1.

Two Video Segmentation Tracks Track 1: MOSE Track Complex Video Object Segmentation (MOSE) [10] aims to track and segment objects in videos of complex environments. This track is based on the MOSE [10] dataset, which is new video object segmentation benchmark designed to study object tracking and segmentation in complex, real-world scenes. Unlike previous video segmentation datasets [32, 43] that focus on salient and isolated objects, MOSE features crowded environments, frequent occlusions, and object disappearances. It consists of 2,149 video clips and 5,200 objects across 36 categories, with over 430,000 high-quality segmentation masks. MOSE challenges existing VOS models and highlights the performance gap in complex scenarios, encouraging further research into robust segmentation techniques. This years testing set is part of MOSE testing set, but with more challenging newly taken data added. The ground truths of all videos in the testing sets are confidential"

[16.04.2025 06:18] Abstract 0. With the release of the o1 model by OpenAI, reasoning models adopting slow thinking strategies have gradually emerged. As the responses generated by such models often include complex reasoning, intermediate steps, and self-reflection, existing evaluation methods are often inadequate. They struggle t...

[16.04.2025 06:18] Abstract 1. An AI system can create and maintain knowledge only to the extent that it can verify that knowledge itself. Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning has demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but their verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently ...

[16.04.2025 06:18] Abstract 2. As the post-training of large language models (LLMs) advances from instruction-following to complex reasoning tasks, understanding how different data affect finetuning dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a spectral analysis of layer-wise gradients induced by low/high-quali...

[16.04.2025 06:18] Abstract 6. This paper introduces SAIL, a single transformer unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) that integrates raw pixel encoding and language decoding within a singular architecture.

Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision to large language models (LLMs), but scaling up training data annotation remains challenging for both humans and LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose an active learning approach, ActPRM, which proactively selects the most uncertain ...

[16.04.2025 06:18] Abstract 10. The application of diffusion models in 3D LiDAR scene completion is limited due to diffusion's slow sampling speed.
