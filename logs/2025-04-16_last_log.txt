Text:"5 2 0 2 4 1 ] . [ 1 7 3 3 0 1 . 4 0 5 2 : r Heimdall: test-time scaling on the generative verification Wenlei Shi, Xing JinAn AI system can create and maintain knowledge only to the extent that it can verify that knowledge itself [23]. Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning has demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but their verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM that can accurately judge the correctness of solutions. With pure reinforcement learning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive math problems. By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further increases to 97.5%. Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive generalization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging math proofs, the type of which is not included during training. Furthermore, we propose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to scaling up the problem solving. It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from solver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely correct solution with the least uncertainty. Taking DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the solver model, Pessimistic Verification improves the solution accuracy on AIME2025 from 54.2% to 70.0% with 16 compute budget and to 83.3% with more compute budget. With the stronger solver Gemini 2.5 Pro, the score reaches 93.0%. Finally, we prototype an automatic knowledge discovery system, ternary system where one poses questions, another provides solutions, and the third verifies the solutions. Using the data synthesis work NuminaMath [13] for the first two components, Heimdall effectively identifies problematic records within the dataset and reveals that nearly half of the data is flawed, which interestingly aligns with the recent ablation studies from NuminaMath. Date: April 15, 2025 Correspondence: Wenlei Shi at wenlei.shi@bytedance.com, Xing Jin at jinxing.9@bytedance.comIn the realm of scientific and mathematical discovery, the process of logistic verification and validation is as crucial as the initial act of problem-solving. One of the most illustrative examples of this principle can be found in the famous thought experiment chasing beam of light by Albert Einstein, where he found the paradox within the established physics theories and further formulated the principle of the constancy of the speed of light, cornerstone of his Special Theory of Relativity. Recently, the problem solving ability of LLMs have been significantly improved. With the long Chain of Thought(CoT) reasoning, advanced LLMs are now able to effectively solve complex competition-level problems in both math and code domains. However, the verification ability of LLMs has not been sufficiently investigated. On one hand, although the intelligence of general purposed LLM increases rapidly with the long CoT capabilities, we find that current SOTA models with direct prompting [5, 21] are not good at verifications on complex problems, e.g., o1-mini only achieves 1 Figure 1 Scaling of Heimdall. Left: the verification accuracy scales with the response length during RL training. With more reasoning tokens, Heimdall gives more accurate judgment on the solutions on AIME2024. Middle: the verification accuracy scales with repeated sampling and Majority Voting. By sampling multiple verification trajectories and voting, the accuracy can be further improved. Right: with Heimdall scoring the solutions on AIME2025, the problem solving accuracy scales with the number of solutions. We verify 16 times on each solution and select the most likely correct one with Pessimistic Verification(16). When inter-playing with various solver models, Heimdall gives significant improvements over pure solver-based Majority Voting(MV). 80.9% on our evaluation dataset. On the other hand, some work [16, 17, 22, 25, 29, 32, 35] trains dedicated model for verification or critique but the high-quality verification data is hard to collect, which limits the verification capability and hence impedes the application to challenging problems. In this paper, we claim that verifying if solution is correct is special type of problem solving, i.e., true/false question and involves step-by-step judgment on the solution. Inspired by the recent progress on the long CoT reasoning, we propose to train long CoT verifier through reinforcement learning. We name it Heimdall, symbolizing its sharp ability to detect errors and safeguards the correctness of knowledge. We leverage PPO [20] algorithm and find that the data processing is critical to the RL training. Specifically, two types of problems hinder the optimization, i.e., easy problems with only correct solutions and hard problems with only wrong solutions, both of which lack contrastive examples and tends to guide the verifier to simply identify the hardness of problem, rather than finding the wrong position in the solution. By filtering out the two cases, the model learns the verification ability more effectively. Taking the competitive math problems as our primary experimental domain, we show that the verification ability follows the test time scaling law where the accuracy improves significantly from 62.5% to 94.5% as the response length grows, as is shown the left of Figure 1. The performance can be further improved by sampling multiple verifications and voting on the judgment results. In the middle of Figure 1, the accuracy grows from 94.5% to 97.5% on AIME2024 as the number of verifications grows from 2 to 64. Furthermore, the evaluation from human experts shows that Heimdall generalizes well on math proof problems although it is trained with only the calculation problems with explicit answers. In addition, we extend the usage of Heimdall to scale up the problem solving. Suppose the solver model gives multiple solutions for problem and Heimdall judges the correctness of each solution for multiple times. We can select the best solution based on the verification results. We frame the selection process as multi-arm bandit problem where solutions with the same conclusion are treated as multiple visits to the same arm. Based on the pessimism principle, we propose the solution selection algorithm called Pessimistic Verification that minimizes the uncertainty of selecting wrong solutions. The algorithm unifies Majority Voting and reward m"

With the release of the o1 model by OpenAI, reasoning models adopting slow thinking strategies have gradually emerged. As the responses generated by such models often include complex reasoning, intermediate steps, and self-reflection, existing evaluation methods are often inadequate. They struggle to determine whether the LLM output is truly equivalent to the reference answer, and also have difficulty identifying and extracting the final answer from long, complex responses. To address this issue, we propose xVerify, an efficient answer verifier for reasoning model evaluations. xVerify demonstrates strong capability in equivalence judgment, enabling it to effectively determine whether the answers produced by reasoning models are equivalent to reference answers across various types of objective questions. To train and evaluate xVerify, we construct the VAR dataset by collecting question-answer pairs generated by multiple LLMs across various datasets, leveraging multiple reasoning models and challenging evaluation sets designed specifically for reasoning model assessment. A multi-round annotation process is employed to ensure label accuracy. Based on the VAR dataset, we train multiple xVerify models of different scales. In evaluation experiments conducted on both the test set and generalization set, all xVerify models achieve overall F1 scores and accuracy exceeding 95\%. Notably, the smallest variant, xVerify-0.5B-I, outperforms all evaluation methods except GPT-4o, while xVerify-3B-Ib surpasses GPT-4o in overall performance. These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of xVerify.

"An AI system can create and maintain knowledge only to the extent that it can verify that knowledge itself. Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning has demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but their verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM that can accurately judge the correctness of solutions. With pure reinforcement learning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive math problems. By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further increases to 97.5%. Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive generalization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging math proofs, the type of which is not included during training. Furthermore, we propose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to scaling up the problem solving. It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from a solver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely correct solution with the least uncertainty. Taking DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the solver model, Pessimistic Verification improves the solution accuracy on AIME2025 from 54.2% to 70.0% with 16x compute budget and to 83.3% with more compute budget. With the stronger solver Gemini 2.5 Pro, the score reaches 93.0%. Finally, we prototype an automatic knowledge discovery system, a ternary system where one poses questions, another provides solutions, and the third verifies the solutions. Using the data synthesis work NuminaMath for the first two components, Heimdall effectively identifies problematic records within the dataset and reveals that nearly half of the data is flawed, which interestingly aligns with the recent ablation studies from NuminaMath."

The application of diffusion models in 3D LiDAR scene completion is limited due to diffusion's slow sampling speed. Score distillation accelerates diffusion sampling but with performance degradation, while post-training with direct policy optimization (DPO) boosts performance using preference data. This paper proposes Distillation-DPO, a novel diffusion distillation framework for LiDAR scene completion with preference aligment. First, the student model generates paired completion scenes with different initial noises. Second, using LiDAR scene evaluation metrics as preference, we construct winning and losing sample pairs. Such construction is reasonable, since most LiDAR scene metrics are informative but non-differentiable to be optimized directly. Third, Distillation-DPO optimizes the student model by exploiting the difference in score functions between the teacher and student models on the paired completion scenes. Such procedure is repeated until convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art LiDAR scene completion diffusion models, Distillation-DPO achieves higher-quality scene completion while accelerating the completion speed by more than 5-fold. Our method is the first to explore adopting preference learning in distillation to the best of our knowledge and provide insights into preference-aligned distillation. Our code is public available on https://github.com/happyw1nd/DistillationDPO.

As the post-training of large language models (LLMs) advances from instruction-following to complex reasoning tasks, understanding how different data affect finetuning dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a spectral analysis of layer-wise gradients induced by low/high-quality instruction and reasoning data for LLM post-training. Our analysis reveals that widely-studied metrics for data evaluation, e.g., IFD, InsTag, Difficulty, and Reward, can be explained and unified by spectral properties computed from gradients' singular value decomposition (SVD). Specifically, higher-quality data are usually associated with lower nuclear norms and higher effective ranks. Notably, effective rank exhibits better robustness and resolution than nuclear norm in capturing subtle quality differences. For example, reasoning data achieves substantially higher effective ranks than instruction data, implying richer gradient structures on more complex tasks. Our experiments also highlight that models within the same family share similar gradient patterns regardless of their sizes, whereas different model families diverge significantly. Providing a unified view on the effects of data quality across instruction and reasoning data, this work illuminates the interplay between data quality and training stability, shedding novel insights into developing better data exploration strategies for post-training.
