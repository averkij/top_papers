[ 2 0 7 3 2 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r Parameters vs FLOPs: Scaling Laws for Optimal Sparsity for Mixture-of-Experts Language Models Samira Abnar Apple Harshay Shah MIT Dan Busbridge Apple Alaaeldin Mohamed Elnouby Ali Apple Josh Susskind Apple Vimal Thilak Apple Abstract Scaling the capacity of language models has consistently proven to be reliable approach for improving performance and unlocking new capabilities. Capacity can be primarily defined by two dimensions: the number of model parameters and the compute per example. While scaling typically involves increasing both, the precise interplay between these factors and their combined contribution to overall capacity remains not fully understood. We explore this relationship in the context of sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) , which allow scaling the number of parameters without proportionally increasing the FLOPs per example. We investigate how varying the sparsity level, i.e., the fraction of inactive parameters, impacts models performance during pretraining and downstream few-shot evaluation. We find that under different constraints (e.g., parameter size and total training compute), there is an optimal level of sparsity that improves both training efficiency and model performance. These results provide better understanding of the impact of sparsity in scaling laws for MoEs and complement existing works in this area, offering insights for designing more efficient architectures. Empirical scaling laws for language model pretraining (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023; OpenAI et al., 2024; Gemini Team et al., 2024; Henighan et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2022; Yun et al., 2024; Ludziejewski et al., 2024) have demonstrated that proportionally increasing model capacity, along with data and total compute budget, consistently decreases pretraining loss (i.e., perplexity), improves downstream task performance (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; BIG-bench authors, 2023) and unlocks emergent"
