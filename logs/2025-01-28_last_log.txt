INTRODUCTION recent years, (zero-shot) speech generation research has witnessed significant advancements [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], with diverse models utilizing large-scale training datasets. These advancements lead to improved voice quality, timbre similarity, and naturalness [8]. Nevertheless, generated speech still falls short of replicating the spontaneity and variability characteristic of real-world human speech [2], [9]. primary factor for this limitation is the reliance of current speech generation models on datasets derived from audiobooks [10], [11]. Such datasets predominantly feature formal, read-aloud speech styles, which starkly contrast with the diverse and spontaneous nature of human speech in casual or conversational settings. Real-world speech is characterized Haorui He, Chaoren Wang, Yicheng Gu, Liwei Liu, Jiaqi Li, Yuancheng Wang, and Zhizheng Wu are with the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China Zengqiang Shang, Xuyuan Li, Hua Hua, Chen Yang, Peiyang Shi, and Pengyuan Zhang are with the Laboratory of Speech and Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Acoustics, CAS, Beijing, China.

Kai Chen is with Shanghai AI Laboratory, Shanghai, China. : Equal contribution, and the names are listed in random order. by wide range of phenomena, including breathing sounds, pauses, stuttering, repetitions, variations in speaking rate and emotions. Therefore, there is significant research gap for new dataset that captures broader spectrum of speech styles to advance the field toward generating more spontaneous and human-like speech. However, directly utilizing in-the-wild speech data presents significant challenges due to variations in quality, typically manifested as frequent background noise or music, reverberation, overlapping speakers within single sample, inconsistent audio lengths, and the absence of essential annotations such as text transcriptions [12], [13]. Training speech generation models on such unprocessed raw data can lead to degraded performance [12], [14], [15], [16]. Although prior studies [12], [13] have proposed automatic preprocessing pipelines to address challenges associated with in-the-wild speech data, these pipelines heavily rely on proprietary models, significantly limiting their accessibility to the broader research community. Additionally, these pipelines are restricted to monolingual (i.e., Chinese-only) speech data, rendering them unsuitable for processing the vast multilingual speech data available in the wild. Furthermore, the computational efficiency of these pipelines remains undocumented, raising concerns about their practicality for scaling speech generation datasets. There is an urgent need for an effective open-source preprocessing pipeline capable of handling multilingual in-the-wild speech data efficiently and facilitating substantial dataset expansion. In response, we introduce Emilia-Pipe, the first opensource preprocessing pipeline designed to harness valuable yet underexplored in-the-wild multilingual speech data for building high-quality training datasets of spontaneous and human-like speech generation models. The Emilia-Pipe is designed to comprise six core preprocessing steps: standardization, source separation, speaker diarization, fine-grained segmentation via voice activity detection (VAD), automated speech recognition (ASR), and filtering. Furthermore, Emilia-Pipe incorporates extensive engineering optimizations to enhance both robustness and efficiency. These designs position Emilia-Pipe as versatile and scalable tool for constructing extensive, multilingual, and diverse speech datasets, thereby addressing the critical gap in speech generation. Leveraging Emilia-Pipe, we construct Emilia, the first multilingual speech generation dataset derived from in-the-wild speech data, which comprises over 101k hours of speech data at 24 kHz and spans six languages: English (En), Chinese (Zh), German (De), French (Fr), Japanese (Ja), and Korean (Ko).
