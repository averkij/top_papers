Text:"Return of the Encoder: Maximizing Parameter Efficiency for SLMs Mohamed Elfeki * 1 Rui Liu * 1 Chad Voegele *1. Introduction 5 2 0 2 7 2 ] . [ 1 3 7 2 6 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r The dominance of large decoder-only language models has overshadowed encoder-decoder architectures, despite their fundamental efficiency advantages in sequence processing. For small language models (SLMs) - those with 1 billion parameters or fewer - our systematic analysis across GPU, CPU, and NPU platforms reveals that encoder-decoder architectures achieve 47% lower first-token latency and 4.7x higher throughput compared to decoder-only models on edge devices. These gains may be attributed to encoderdecoders one-time input processing and efficient separation of understanding and generation phases. We introduce novel knowledge distillation framework that enables encoder-decoder models to leverage capabilities from large scalable decoder-only teachers while preserving their architectural advantages, achieving up to 6 average performance points improvement across diverse tasks, with significant gains in asymmetric sequence tasks where input and output distributions can benefit from different processing approaches. When combined with modern advances like Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) and Vision encoders, our systematic investigation demonstrates that encoder-decoder architectures provide more practical path toward deploying capable language models in resource-constrained environments. Our findings challenge the prevailing trend toward decoder-only scaling, showing that architectural choices become increasingly crucial as parameter budgets decrease, particularly for on-device and edge deployments where computational efficiency is paramount. *Equal contribution. 1Microsoft. Code and models will be released at: microsoft/encoder-decoder-slm. 1 The introduction of the Transformer (Vaswani, 2017) as an encoder-decoder architecture revolutionized sequence modeling and proven remarkably robust over time. While encoder-decoder transformers demonstrated strong performance, their inherent information bottleneck between encoder and decoder components ultimately constrained further scaling to hundreds of billions of parameters, as demonstrated in Raffel et al. (2020); Chowdhery et al. (2023). This limitation led the field toward decoder-only architectures, following Suttons bitter lesson (Sutton, 2019) that general methods leveraging computation often outperform specialized architectures. Models like GPT (Radford, 2018) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) have demonstrated impressive scaling properties (Kaplan et al., 2020), achieving state-of-the-art performance through increased parameter counts by eliminating this bottleneck and enabling more flexible parameter utilization at scale. Despite this trend, encoder-decoder architectures offer specific advantages through their separation of comprehension and generation stages. The encoder constructs fixed representation of the input sequence, while the decoder performs targeted attention over encoded information during generation. This separation creates two key benefits: efficient handling of divergent input-output distributions (as in summarization and translation) and elimination of key-value (KV) cache requirements for input sequences, making them particularly efficient for tasks involving large inputs like code or long document reasoning/QA. Recent advances in positional encoding, particularly Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), further enhances encoderdecoder architectures in two ways: by enabling precise encoding of relative token distances for improved reasoning over long contexts, and by facilitating efficient parameter utilization through asymmetric scaling. This dual benefit allows the architecture to both handle complex positional reasoning tasks like QA while enabling flexible optimization of encoder and decoder sizes for different tasks. Through pipelined inference, 2N-parameter encoder-decoder model can match the computational efficiency of an N-parameter decoder-only model (Wang et al., 2022). While the architectures inherent information bottleneck Return of the Encoder: Maximizing Parameter Efficiency for SLMs Figure 1. Architectural Efficiency in SLMs. Left: Comparison of architectures where encoder-decoder creates fixed input representation with KV cache only for output, while decoder-only requires growing KV caches for both input and output. Top right: Inference time scaling with input length, showing encoder-decoders efficient fixed-representation approach versus decoder-onlys steeper computational growth. Bottom right: Performance across tasks showing encoder-decoders advantages at fixed compute budget, further enhanced by KD. may constrain scaling to extremely large sizes (Raffel et al., 2020), this same constraint provides valuable inductive biases at more practical scalesas demonstrated by Chia et al. (2023); Raffel et al. (2020), where T5 models at just 20B parameters consistently outperform much larger architectures like the 62B parameter PaLM-1 (Chowdhery et al., 2023) on specific downstream tasks requiring precise positional understanding and efficient parameter utilization.

Related Work Language model architectures have evolved through the interplay of theoretical advances and practical constraints, particularly in resource-constrained deployments of smallscale language models (SLMs). 2.1. Evolution of Transformer Architectures The Transformer architecture (Vaswani, 2017) revolutionized sequence modeling by replacing recurrent networks with attention mechanisms.

Customizable role-playing in large language models (LLMs), also known as character generalization, is gaining increasing attention for its versatility and cost-efficiency in developing and deploying role-playing dialogue agents. This study explores a large-scale data synthesis approach to equip LLMs with character generalization capabilities. We begin by synthesizing large-scale character profiles using personas from Persona Hub and then explore two strategies: response rewriting and response generation, to create character-aligned instructional responses. To validate the effectiveness of our synthetic instruction tuning data for character generalization, we perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using the LLaMA-3 8B model. Our best-performing model strengthens the original LLaMA-3 8B Instruct model and achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o models on role-playing dialogue. We release our synthetic characters and instruction-tuning dialogues to support public research.

"Customizable role-playing in large language models (LLMs), also known as character generalization, is gaining increasing attention for its versatility and cost-efficiency in developing and deploying role-playing dialogue agents. This study explores a large-scale data synthesis approach to equip LLMs with character generalization capabilities. We begin by synthesizing large-scale character profiles using personas from Persona Hub and then explore two strategies: response rewriting and response generation, to create character-aligned instructional responses. To validate the effectiveness of our synthetic instruction tuning data for character generalization, we perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using the LLaMA-3 8B model. Our best-performing model strengthens the original LLaMA-3 8B Instruct model and achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o models on role-playing dialogue. We release our synthetic characters and instruction-tuning dialogues to support public research."

The dominance of large decoder-only language models has overshadowed encoder-decoder architectures, despite their fundamental efficiency advantages in sequence processing. For small language models (SLMs) - those with 1 billion parameters or fewer - our systematic analysis across GPU, CPU, and NPU platforms reveals that encoder-decoder architectures achieve 47% lower first-token latency and 4.7x higher throughput compared to decoder-only models on edge devices. These gains may be attributed to encoder-decoder's one-time input processing and efficient separation of understanding and generation phases.   We introduce a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables encoder-decoder models to leverage capabilities from large scalable decoder-only teachers while preserving their architectural advantages, achieving up to 6 average performance points improvement across diverse tasks, with significant gains in asymmetric sequence tasks where input and output distributions can benefit from different processing approaches.   When combined with modern advances like Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) and Vision encoders, our systematic investigation demonstrates that encoder-decoder architectures provide a more practical path toward deploying capable language models in resource-constrained environments. Our findings challenge the prevailing trend toward decoder-only scaling, showing that architectural choices become increasingly crucial as parameter budgets decrease, particularly for on-device and edge deployments where computational efficiency is paramount.
