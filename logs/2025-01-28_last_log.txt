(2024), DeltaNet Yang et al. (2024b), Mamba-2 Wang et al. (2024), GLA Yang et al. (2023), and others https://github.com/Jellyfish042/Sudoku-RWKV, https://github.com/Jellyfish042/RWKV_Othello https://huggingface.co/recursal/QRWKV6-32B-Instruct-Preview-v0.1 showing strong competitiveness with transformers. However, these models face natural penalties in context learning and long-context retrivel due to subquadratic attention limitations. Recently, RWKV-7 introduced promising architecture, where 0.1B parameter model achieved perfect results in 16k passkey retrieval. With its transition matrix having wider eigenvalues Grazzi et al. (2024), it demonstrates stronger state tracking capabilities than transformers Merrill et al. (2024). While Qwen 2.5 was trained on 18 trillion tokens requiring enormous GPU resources, making pretraining impractical for academic use, we bridge this gap by refining the distillation method. Our approach enables training 7B parameter model on single A100 80G GPU, while 4x8 A100s can handle 32B model.We know qwen 2.5 dense models is the Transformer-based decoder architecture with group query attention, SwiGLU activation function for non-linear activation, Rotary Positional Embeddings for encoding position information, QKV bias in the attention mechanism and RMSNorm Yang et al. (2024a). We only keep RMSnorm and SwiGLU activiation and replace the rest with rwkv-7 attention.In GQA, queries are grouped while keys and values remain separate: GQA(Qg , K, ) = concat (cid:104) head1, ..., headg (cid:105) where each head is computed as: headi = Attention(QiW , KW , i ) In RWKV-7 attention which is the time mixing: Statet = Statet (cid:16) diag(wt) ˆκT (at (cid:17) ˆκt) + vT kt the state means matrix-valued attention state.where is the in-context learning rate. In the comparing with RWKV-6 Peng et al. (2024): state = diag(w) state + then we just relpace self-attention in every layer with RWKV-7 time mixing module in Figure 1. (1) (2) (3) (4)"
