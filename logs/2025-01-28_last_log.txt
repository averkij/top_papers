[ 1 5 9 2 6 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r aState Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for sequential modeling, but their inability to leverage modalityspecific features limits their performance in multimodal pretraining. Here, we propose Mixtureof-Mamba, novel SSM architecture that introduces modality-aware sparsity through modalityspecific parameterization of the Mamba block. Building on Mixture-of-Transformers (W. Liang et al. arXiv:2411.04996; 2024), we extend the benefits of modality-aware sparsity to SSMs while preserving their computational efficiency.

Mixture-of-Mamba consistently reaches the same loss values at earlier training steps with significantly reduced computational costs. In the Transfusion setting, Mixture-of-Mamba achieves equivalent image loss using only 34.76% of the training FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. In the Chameleon setting, Mixture-of-Mamba reaches similar image loss with just 42.50% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale, and similar text loss with just 65.40% of the FLOPs.

Our code can be accessed at https://github.com/ Weixin-Liang/Mixture-of-Mamba. 1. Introduction State Space Models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; Gu & Dao, 2023) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for sequential modeling, offering linear scaling in sequence length and strong performance in single-modality tasks. Mamba, recent SSM variant, has demonstrated exceptional efficiency and scalability across diverse tasks by leveraging advanced gating mechanisms and selective state-space scanning (Gu & Dao, 2023). Despite these advantages, SSMs, including Mamba, remain inherently dense, applying the same set of parameters across all input tokens, regardless of modality. This uniform parameterization limits their ability to capture modality-specific features, leading to suboptimal performance in multi-modal pretraining. Recent efforts have extended SSMs to multi-modal tasks. Works like VLMamba (Qiao et al., 2024) and Cobra (Zhao et al., 2024) augment Mamba for vision-language modeling by adding LLaVA-style projection modules that map image Mixture-of-Mamba: Enhancing Multi-Modal State-Space Models with Modality-Aware Sparsity features into the token space of Mamba. In the vision domain, Vision Mamba (Zhu et al., 2024) and VMamba (Liu et al., 2024c) incorporate bidirectional scanning schemes and selective 2D scanning paths for image patch modeling. Similarly, Mamba has been explored for diffusion-based image and video generation, as seen in DiffuSSM (Yan et al., 2024) and Zigma (Hu et al., 2024), which employ unique state-space scanning patterns. While these approaches demonstrate the adaptability of Mamba, they are orthogonal to our focus, which introduces modality-aware sparsity directly into the Mamba block itself. promising approach to address such limitations is model sparsity, exemplified by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) (Jacobs et al., 1991; Eigen et al., 2013; Shazeer et al., 2017; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2024; Sukhbaatar et al., 2024). MoE reduces computational load by activating only subset of model components for each input token, allowing experts to specialize in specific aspects of the data. Despite its potential, MoE-based architectures face challenges such as imbalanced expert utilization, bi-level optimization instability, and inefficient load balancing (Shazeer et al., 2017; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022; Shen & Yang, 2021; Xu et al., 2024). These issues motivate the need for alternative sparse architectures that are computationally efficient and easier to optimize. In multi-modal contexts, prior work (Bao et al., 2022b; Wang et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2023b; Lin et al., 2024) has introduced modality-aware sparsity in Transformer-based MoE architectures. These approaches activate specific experts or parameters based on modality, enabling models to specialize in handling diverse data types. Other methods fine-tune modality-specific modules atop dense LLM backbones (Wang et al., 2023; He et al., 2024; Shen et al., 2023a; 2024b). Such methods show that simple rule-based modality routing often outperforms learned routing, likely due to improved training stability and reduced optimization challenges. The closest work to our approach is MoE-Mamba (Pioro et al., 2024) and the related Blackmamba architecture (Anthony et al., 2024), which interleave Mamba blocks with MoE-augmented MLP layers. While effective, these hybrid designs apply sparsity only to the MLP layers, leaving the dense Mamba blocks unmodified. In contrast, we present Mixture-of-Mamba, novel architecture that directly introduces modality-aware sparsity into the Mamba block itself. Inspired by Mixture-of-Transformers (Liang et al., 2024), our approach dynamically selects modalityspecific weights in every input processing component of Mamba, enabling stable and efficient multi-modal pretraining. Furthermore, prior wo"

Text:"5 2 0 2 6 2 ] . [ 1 9 6 3 5 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r Published as conference paper at ICLR 2025 IFORMER: FORMER FOR MOBILE APPLICATION INTEGRATING CONVNET AND TRANSChuanyang Zheng chuanyang zheng@sjtu.edu.cn https://github.com/ChuanyangZheng/iFormerWe present new family of mobile hybrid vision networks, called iFormer, with focus on optimizing latency and accuracy on mobile applications. iFormer effectively integrates the fast local representation capacity of convolution with the efficient global modeling ability of self-attention. The local interactions are derived from transforming standard convolutional network, i.e., ConvNeXt, to design more lightweight mobile network. Our newly introduced mobile modulation attention removes memory-intensive operations in MHA and employs an efficient modulation mechanism to boost dynamic global representational capacity. We conduct comprehensive experiments demonstrating that iFormer outperforms existing lightweight networks across various tasks. Notably, iFormer achieves an impressive Top-1 accuracy of 80.4% on ImageNet-1k with latency of only 1.10 ms on an iPhone 13, surpassing the recently proposed MobileNetV4 under similar latency constraints. Additionally, our method shows significant improvements in downstream tasks, including COCO object detection, instance segmentation, and ADE20k semantic segmentation, while still maintaining low latency on mobile devices for high-resolution inputs in these scenarios.Building lightweight neural networks facilitates real-time analysis of images and videos captured by mobile applications such as smartphones. This not only enhances privacy protection and security by processing data locally on the device but also improves overall user experience. Through the decades, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Szegedy et al., 2015; He et al., 2016) have emerged as the primary choice for balancing latency and performance on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, significant limitation of CNNs is their reliance on local sliding window mechanism, which imposes crucial inductive biases that may hinder modeling flexibility. Recently, the soaring development of vision transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) has begun to dominate various computer vision tasks, including image classification (Zhai et al., 2022), object detection (Liu et al., 2021a), and semantic segmentation (Xie et al., 2021). The core mechanism underlying ViTs is self-attention, which dynamically learns interactions between all image patches. This enables the model to focus on important regions adaptively and capture more global features. Nevertheless, deploying ViTs on mobile devices with limited resources poses significant challenges. On the one hand, the quadratic computational complexity of attention renders them unsuitable for large feature maps, which are common in the early stages of viFigure 1: Comparison of latency and accuracy between our iFormer and other existing methods on ImageNet-1k. The latency is measured on an iPhone 13. Our iFormer is Pareto-optimal. 1 Published as conference paper at ICLR 2025 sion networks. On the other hand, the multi-head mechanism requires reshaping operations, leading to increased memory usage. Many research efforts are devoted to combining the advantages of both CNNs and ViTs in designing lightweight networks while mitigating inefficient operations in mobile applications. Some studies (Zhang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024) revisit the architectural designs of lightweight CNNs from ViT perspective and incorporate key components that contribute to the performance of ViTs into CNNs. Although these pure lightweight CNNs show improved performance compared to previous mobile networks (Howard et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; Sandler et al., 2018), they still lag behind the powerful self-attention in ViTs. Another line of works (Mehta & Rastegari, 2021; Chen et al., 2022b; Li et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023; Shaker et al., 2023; Vasu et al., 2023a; Qin et al., 2024) proposes innovative attention mechanisms to address the limitation of standard attention (Vaswani, 2017) and blend convolutions to achieve better balance between latency and performance. These attention mechanisms either reduce the number of queries and keys (Shaker et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024), limit the attention span (Wan et al., 2023), or adopt linear attention (Cai et al., 2023), which may compromise performance to some extent. In this work, we present the iFormer, herd of lightweight models that integrates the strengths of both CNNs and ViTs, achieving state-of-the-art balance between latency and accuracy. Specifically, we employ hierarchical architecture consisting of four stages. In the earlier, high-resolution stages, we utilize fast convolution to extract local representations. To construct the convolutional block, we start with modern ConvNeXt (Liu et al., 2022), which incorporates series of design decisions inspired by ViTs. Then we progressively lighten the ConvNeXt to create streamlined lightweight network, optimizing it for real-time mobile latency on an iPhone 13, in contrast to the FLOPs and parameters used in prior works (Mehta & Rastegari, 2021; Chen et al., 2022b). This results in fast convolutional architecture with strong performance. To further enhance the dynamic properties and its ability to model long-range contexts, we incorporate self-attention in the later low-resolution stages. However, direct implementation of standard multi-head self-attention (MHA) brings notable memory overheads and slows down inference speed on mobile devices. We identify that the increased latency stems primarily from the reshaping operations in MHA. More analyses reveal that multiple attention heads behave similarly. Therefore, we propose simple yet effective single-head modulation self-attention (SHMA), which significantly minimizes memory costs while preserving strong performance. Fig. 4 provides an illustration of SHMA. In detail, SHMA learns spatial context interactions through optimized self-attention. Concurrently, parallel feature extraction branch is employed to capture informative features. Finally, we fuse the outputs of these two branches to facilitate more flexible and dynamic exchange of information, compensating for the slight performance degradation of the single-head attention when compared to MHA. Benefiting from the fast local representation capacity of convolution and the efficie"

We introduce Baichuan-Omni-1.5, an omni-modal model that not only has omni-modal understanding capabilities but also provides end-to-end audio generation capabilities. To achieve fluent and high-quality interaction across modalities without compromising the capabilities of any modality, we prioritized optimizing three key aspects. First, we establish a comprehensive data cleaning and synthesis pipeline for multimodal data, obtaining about 500B high-quality data (text, audio, and vision). Second, an audio-tokenizer (Baichuan-Audio-Tokenizer) has been designed to capture both semantic and acoustic information from audio, enabling seamless integration and enhanced compatibility with MLLM. Lastly, we designed a multi-stage training strategy that progressively integrates multimodal alignment and multitask fine-tuning, ensuring effective synergy across all modalities. Baichuan-Omni-1.5 leads contemporary models (including GPT4o-mini and MiniCPM-o 2.6) in terms of comprehensive omni-modal capabilities. Notably, it achieves results comparable to leading models such as Qwen2-VL-72B across various multimodal medical benchmarks.

"We introduce Baichuan-Omni-1.5, an omni-modal model that not only has omni-modal understanding capabilities but also provides end-to-end audio generation capabilities. To achieve fluent and high-quality interaction across modalities without compromising the capabilities of any modality, we prioritized optimizing three key aspects. First, we establish a comprehensive data cleaning and synthesis pipeline for multimodal data, obtaining about 500B high-quality data (text, audio, and vision). Second, an audio-tokenizer (Baichuan-Audio-Tokenizer) has been designed to capture both semantic and acoustic information from audio, enabling seamless integration and enhanced compatibility with MLLM. Lastly, we designed a multi-stage training strategy that progressively integrates multimodal alignment and multitask fine-tuning, ensuring effective synergy across all modalities. Baichuan-Omni-1.5 leads contemporary models (including GPT4o-mini and MiniCPM-o 2.6) in terms of comprehensive omni-modal capabilities. Notably, it achieves results comparable to leading models such as Qwen2-VL-72B across various multimodal medical benchmarks."

State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for sequential modeling, but their inability to leverage modality-specific features limits their performance in multi-modal pretraining. Here, we propose Mixture-of-Mamba, a novel SSM architecture that introduces modality-aware sparsity through modality-specific parameterization of the Mamba block. Building on Mixture-of-Transformers (W. Liang et al. arXiv:2411.04996; 2024), we extend the benefits of modality-aware sparsity to SSMs while preserving their computational efficiency. We evaluate Mixture-of-Mamba across three multi-modal pretraining settings: Transfusion (interleaved text and continuous image tokens with diffusion loss), Chameleon (interleaved text and discrete image tokens), and an extended three-modality framework incorporating speech. Mixture-of-Mamba consistently reaches the same loss values at earlier training steps with significantly reduced computational costs. In the Transfusion setting, Mixture-of-Mamba achieves equivalent image loss using only 34.76% of the training FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. In the Chameleon setting, Mixture-of-Mamba reaches similar image loss with just 42.50% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale, and similar text loss with just 65.40% of the FLOPs. In the three-modality setting, MoM matches speech loss at 24.80% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. Our ablation study highlights the synergistic effects of decoupling projection components, where joint decoupling yields greater gains than individual modifications. These results establish modality-aware sparsity as a versatile and effective design principle, extending its impact from Transformers to SSMs and setting new benchmarks in multi-modal pretraining.

We introduce Qwen2.5-1M, a series of models that extend the context length to 1 million tokens. Compared to the previous 128K version, the Qwen2.5-1M series have significantly enhanced long-context capabilities through long-context pre-training and post-training. Key techniques such as long data synthesis, progressive pre-training, and multi-stage supervised fine-tuning are employed to effectively enhance long-context performance while reducing training costs.   To promote the use of long-context models among a broader user base, we present and open-source our inference framework. This framework includes a length extrapolation method that can expand the model context lengths by at least four times, or even more, without additional training. To reduce inference costs, we implement a sparse attention method along with chunked prefill optimization for deployment scenarios and a sparsity refinement method to improve precision. Additionally, we detail our optimizations in the inference engine, including kernel optimization, pipeline parallelism, and scheduling optimization, which significantly enhance overall inference performance. By leveraging our inference framework, the Qwen2.5-1M models achieve a remarkable 3x to 7x prefill speedup in scenarios with 1 million tokens of context. This framework provides an efficient and powerful solution for developing applications that require long-context processing using open-source models.   The Qwen2.5-1M series currently includes the open-source models Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M, as well as the API-accessed model Qwen2.5-Turbo. Evaluations show that Qwen2.5-1M models have been greatly improved in long-context tasks without compromising performance in short-context scenarios. Specifically, the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M model significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini in long-context tasks and supports contexts eight times longer.

We present a new family of mobile hybrid vision networks, called iFormer, with a focus on optimizing latency and accuracy on mobile applications. iFormer effectively integrates the fast local representation capacity of convolution with the efficient global modeling ability of self-attention. The local interactions are derived from transforming a standard convolutional network, i.e., ConvNeXt, to design a more lightweight mobile network. Our newly introduced mobile modulation attention removes memory-intensive operations in MHA and employs an efficient modulation mechanism to boost dynamic global representational capacity. We conduct comprehensive experiments demonstrating that iFormer outperforms existing lightweight networks across various tasks. Notably, iFormer achieves an impressive Top-1 accuracy of 80.4\% on ImageNet-1k with a latency of only 1.10 ms on an iPhone 13, surpassing the recently proposed MobileNetV4 under similar latency constraints. Additionally, our method shows significant improvements in downstream tasks, including COCO object detection, instance segmentation, and ADE20k semantic segmentation, while still maintaining low latency on mobile devices for high-resolution inputs in these scenarios.

We introduce Feasible Learning (FL), a sample-centric learning paradigm where models are trained by solving a feasibility problem that bounds the loss for each training sample. In contrast to the ubiquitous Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework, which optimizes for average performance, FL demands satisfactory performance on every individual data point. Since any model that meets the prescribed performance threshold is a valid FL solution, the choice of optimization algorithm and its dynamics play a crucial role in shaping the properties of the resulting solutions. In particular, we study a primal-dual approach which dynamically re-weights the importance of each sample during training. To address the challenge of setting a meaningful threshold in practice, we introduce a relaxation of FL that incorporates slack variables of minimal norm. Our empirical analysis, spanning image classification, age regression, and preference optimization in large language models, demonstrates that models trained via FL can learn from data while displaying improved tail behavior compared to ERM, with only a marginal impact on average performance.

Reinforcement learning (RL) promises a framework for near-universal problem-solving. In practice however, RL algorithms are often tailored to specific benchmarks, relying on carefully tuned hyperparameters and algorithmic choices. Recently, powerful model-based RL methods have shown impressive general results across benchmarks but come at the cost of increased complexity and slow run times, limiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we attempt to find a unifying model-free deep RL algorithm that can address a diverse class of domains and problem settings. To achieve this, we leverage model-based representations that approximately linearize the value function, taking advantage of the denser task objectives used by model-based RL while avoiding the costs associated with planning or simulated trajectories. We evaluate our algorithm, MR.Q, on a variety of common RL benchmarks with a single set of hyperparameters and show a competitive performance against domain-specific and general baselines, providing a concrete step towards building general-purpose model-free deep RL algorithms.
