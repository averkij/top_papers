Recently, breakthroughs in video modeling have allowed for controllable camera trajectories in generated videos. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to user-provided videos that are not generated by a video model. In this paper, we present ReCapture, a method for generating new videos with novel camera trajectories from a single user-provided video. Our method allows us to re-generate the reference video, with all its existing scene motion, from vastly different angles and with cinematic camera motion. Notably, using our method we can also plausibly hallucinate parts of the scene that were not observable in the reference video. Our method works by (1) generating a noisy anchor video with a new camera trajectory using multiview diffusion models or depth-based point cloud rendering and then (2) regenerating the anchor video into a clean and temporally consistent reangled video using our proposed masked video fine-tuning technique.

Video generation models are revolutionizing content creation, with image-to-video models drawing increasing attention due to their enhanced controllability, visual consistency, and practical applications. However, despite their popularity, these models rely on user-provided text and image prompts, and there is currently no dedicated dataset for studying these prompts. In this paper, we introduce TIP-I2V, the first large-scale dataset of over 1.70 million unique user-provided Text and Image Prompts specifically for Image-to-Video generation. Additionally, we provide the corresponding generated videos from five state-of-the-art image-to-video models. We begin by outlining the time-consuming and costly process of curating this large-scale dataset. Next, we compare TIP-I2V to two popular prompt datasets, VidProM (text-to-video) and DiffusionDB (text-to-image), highlighting differences in both basic and semantic information. This dataset enables advancements in image-to-video research. For instance, to develop better models, researchers can use the prompts in TIP-I2V to analyze user preferences and evaluate the multi-dimensional performance of their trained models; and to enhance model safety, they may focus on addressing the misinformation issue caused by image-to-video models. The new research inspired by TIP-I2V and the differences with existing datasets emphasize the importance of a specialized image-to-video prompt dataset. The project is publicly available at https://tip-i2v.github.io.
