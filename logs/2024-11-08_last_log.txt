As the context limits of Large Language Models (LLMs) increase, the range of possible applications and downstream functions broadens. In many real-world tasks, decisions depend on details scattered across collections of often disparate documents containing mostly irrelevant information. Long-context LLMs appear well-suited to this form of complex information retrieval and reasoning, which has traditionally proven costly and time-consuming. However, although the development of longer context models has seen rapid gains in recent years, our understanding of how effectively LLMs use their context has not kept pace. To address this, we conduct a set of retrieval experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities of 17 leading LLMs, such as their ability to follow threads of information through the context window. Strikingly, we find that many models are remarkably threadsafe: capable of simultaneously following multiple threads without significant loss in performance. Still, for many models, we find the effective context limit is significantly shorter than the supported context length, with accuracy decreasing as the context window grows. Our study also highlights the important point that token counts from different tokenizers should not be directly compared -- they often correspond to substantially different numbers of written characters. We release our code and long-context experimental data.

"As the context limits of Large Language Models (LLMs) increase, the range of possible applications and downstream functions broadens. In many real-world tasks, decisions depend on details scattered across collections of often disparate documents containing mostly irrelevant information. Long-context LLMs appear well-suited to this form of complex information retrieval and reasoning, which has traditionally proven costly and time-consuming. However, although the development of longer context models has seen rapid gains in recent years, our understanding of how effectively LLMs use their context has not kept pace. To address this, we conduct a set of retrieval experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities of 17 leading LLMs, such as their ability to follow threads of information through the context window. Strikingly, we find that many models are remarkably threadsafe: capable of simultaneously following multiple threads without significant loss in performance. Still, for many models, we find the effective context limit is significantly shorter than the supported context length, with accuracy decreasing as the context window grows. Our study also highlights the important point that token counts from different tokenizers should not be directly compared -- they often correspond to substantially different numbers of written characters. We release our code and long-context experimental data."

Fine-grained alignment between videos and text is challenging due to complex spatial and temporal dynamics in videos. Existing video-based Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) handle basic conversations but struggle with precise pixel-level grounding in videos. To address this, we introduce VideoGLaMM, a LMM designed for fine-grained pixel-level grounding in videos based on user-provided textual inputs. Our design seamlessly connects three key components: a Large Language Model, a dual vision encoder that emphasizes both spatial and temporal details, and a spatio-temporal decoder for accurate mask generation. This connection is facilitated via tunable V-L and L-V adapters that enable close Vision-Language (VL) alignment. The architecture is trained to synchronize both spatial and temporal elements of video content with textual instructions. To enable fine-grained grounding, we curate a multimodal dataset featuring detailed visually-grounded conversations using a semiautomatic annotation pipeline, resulting in a diverse set of 38k video-QA triplets along with 83k objects and 671k masks. We evaluate VideoGLaMM on three challenging tasks: Grounded Conversation Generation, Visual Grounding, and Referring Video Segmentation. Experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms existing approaches across all three tasks.
