Text:"Omni-Attribute: Open-vocabulary Attribute Encoder for Visual Concept Personalization Tsai-Shien Chen1,2, Aliaksandr Siarohin1 Guocheng Gordon Qian1 Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang1 Egor Nemchinov1 Moayed Haji-Ali1 Riza Alp Guler1 Willi Menapace1 Ivan Skorokhodov1 Anil Kag1 Jun-Yan Zhu3 Sergey Tulyakov1 1Snap Inc. 2UC Merced 3CMU https://snap-research.github.io/omni-attribute 5 2 0 2 1 1 ] . [ 1 5 5 9 0 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r Figure 1. Omni-Attribute is an open-vocabulary image attribute encoder that learns to extract attribute-specific representations from visual inputs. Given reference images (top row) paired with textual attribute descriptions (colored text boxes), Omni-Attribute encodes attribute representations that can be coherently synthesized in new contexts (middle and bottom rows) in fully feed-forward manner, without any test-time optimization. These learned representations possess two key properties: (a) they capture high-fidelity, fine-grained details of the user-specified image attributes while suppressing irrelevant visual information, thereby mitigating copy-and-paste artifacts; and (b) they are composable, enabling the seamless integration of representations from multiple images into single coherent generated image. This work was done while interning at Snap. "

Omni-Attribute, an open-vocabulary image attribute encoder, learns attribute-specific representations to enable precise visual concept personalization and compositional generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual concept personalization aims to transfer only specific image attributes, such as identity, expression, lighting, and style, into unseen contexts. However, existing methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it difficult to isolate a single attribute. This often leads to information leakage and incoherent synthesis. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-Attribute, the first open-vocabulary image attribute encoder designed to learn high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations. Our approach jointly designs the data and model: (i) we curate semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive and negative attributes to explicitly teach the encoder what to preserve or suppress; and (ii) we adopt a dual-objective training paradigm that balances generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement. The resulting embeddings prove effective for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Авторы решают проблему переплетения различных факторов в целостных эмбеддингах, что приводит к утечке информации при персонализации концепций. Для этого они разработали специальную методику обучения с парами семантически связанных изображений, помеченных положительными и отрицательными атрибутами, и двухцелевую функцию потерь, баланансирующую качество генерации и разделение представлений. Полученные эмбеддинги успешно применяются для поиска атрибутов, персонализации и композиционной генерации в открытом словаре.",
