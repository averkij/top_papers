StereoSpace for generating stereo from monocular images. Left: Built on foundational LDM, our framework efficiently leverages learned priors for end-to-end view synthesis. The target baseline in world units acts as conditioning for precise view control. Images featuring the dragon are illustrative examples. Right: Implicit scene understanding allows us to tackle the most complex cases where geometry cues alone are insufficient for novel view synthesis. Best viewed zoomed-in.

StereoSpace uses viewpoint-conditioned diffusion to generate stereo images without explicit depth or warping, achieving superior performance on various scenes.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce StereoSpace, a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that models geometry purely through viewpoint conditioning, without explicit depth or warping. A canonical rectified space and the conditioning guide the generator to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end. To ensure fair and leakage-free evaluation, we introduce an end-to-end protocol that excludes any ground truth or proxy geometry estimates at test time. The protocol emphasizes metrics reflecting downstream relevance: iSQoE for perceptual comfort and MEt3R for geometric consistency. StereoSpace surpasses other methods from the warp & inpaint, latent-warping, and warped-conditioning categories, achieving sharp parallax and strong robustness on layered and non-Lambertian scenes. This establishes viewpoint-conditioned diffusion as a scalable, depth-free solution for stereo generation.

Система использует канонический прямоугольный формат и условное кодирование для обучения генератора вычислять соответствия между пикселями и восполнять невидимые области в едином сквозном процессе. Авторы предложили новый протокол оценки без утечки информации, использующий метрики iSQoE для перцепционного комфорта и MEt3R для геометрической согласованности. Метод превосходит существующие подходы на сценах со слоистой структурой и неламбертовскими поверхностями, демонстрируя глубокий параллакс и надёжность без явного использования информации о глубине.",
