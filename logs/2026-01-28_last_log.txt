Text:"Youtu-VL Technical Report Youtu-VL: Unleashing Visual Potential via Unified Vision-Language Supervision Youtu-VL Team Despite the significant advancements represented by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current architectures often exhibit limitations in retaining fine-grained visual information, leading to coarsegrained multimodal comprehension. We attribute this deficiency to suboptimal training paradigm inherent in prevailing VLMs, which exhibits text-dominant optimization bias by conceptualizing visual signals merely as passive conditional inputs rather than supervisory targets. To mitigate this, we introduce Youtu-VL, framework leveraging the Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision (VLUAS) paradigm, which fundamentally shifts the optimization objective from visionas-input to vision-as-target. By integrating visual tokens directly into the prediction stream, Youtu-VL applies unified autoregressive supervision to both visual details and linguistic content. Furthermore, we extend this paradigm to encompass vision-centric tasks, enabling standard VLM to perform vision-centric tasks without task-specific additions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-VL achieves competitive performance on both general multimodal tasks and vision-centric tasks, establishing robust foundation for the development of comprehensive generalist visual agents.

Text:"2026-1-27 CooperBench: Why Coding Agents Cannot be Your Teammates Yet Arpandeep Khatua1, Hao Zhu1, Peter Tran2, Arya Prabhudesai2, Frederic Sadrieh2, Johann K. Lieberwirth2, Xinkai Yu1, Yicheng Fu1, Michael J. Ryan1, Jiaxin Pei1, Diyi Yang1 1Stanford University https://cooperbench.com 2SAP Labs US Equal Contribution Equal Contribution Figure 1 The CooperBench benchmark draws tasks for two agents from pool of features with potential conflicts. The agents execute the tasks in their individual environments, communicating in real time to coordinate. Success is measured by whether the resulting code changes by both agents are compatible and pass the requirements for both features. Resolving team conflicts requires not only task-specific competence, but also social intelligence to find common ground and build consensus. Similarly, as AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this hypothesis, we introduce CooperBench, benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating stateof-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually, across the full spectrum of task difficulties. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves rather than diminishes productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorr"

Youtu-VL addresses limitations in Vision-Language Models by introducing a unified autoregressive supervision paradigm that treats visual signals as target outputs rather than passive inputs, enabling improved multimodal comprehension and vision-centric task performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite the significant advancements represented by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current architectures often exhibit limitations in retaining fine-grained visual information, leading to coarse-grained multimodal comprehension. We attribute this deficiency to a suboptimal training paradigm inherent in prevailing VLMs, which exhibits a text-dominant optimization bias by conceptualizing visual signals merely as passive conditional inputs rather than supervisory targets. To mitigate this, we introduce Youtu-VL, a framework leveraging the Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision (VLUAS) paradigm, which fundamentally shifts the optimization objective from ``vision-as-input'' to ``vision-as-target.'' By integrating visual tokens directly into the prediction stream, Youtu-VL applies unified autoregressive supervision to both visual details and linguistic content. Furthermore, we extend this paradigm to encompass vision-centric tasks, enabling a standard VLM to perform vision-centric tasks without task-specific additions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-VL achieves competitive performance on both general multimodal tasks and vision-centric tasks, establishing a robust foundation for the development of comprehensive generalist visual agents.

Resolving team conflicts requires not only task-specific competence, but also social intelligence to find common ground and build consensus. As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence.
