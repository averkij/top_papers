Website: https://technology.robbyant.com/lingbot-vla Github: https://github.com/robbyant/lingbot-vla Checkpoints: https://huggingface.co/collections/robbyant/lingbot-vlaVision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation models [5, 6, 27] have emerged as promising method for enabling robots to perform diverse manipulation tasks guided by natural language instructions. Through large-scale pre-training, these models acquire generalizable skills that can be rapidly adapted to diverse tasks and robotic platforms. Despite the significant progress, there remains lack of comprehensive empirical studies on how real-robot performance scales with increasingly vast pre-training datasets. Moreover, the community lacks highly optimized training codebase capable of efficiently conducting these scaling evaluations on massive volumes of data. Consequently, fundamental question that demands investigation in the real-world setting is: How do VLA models truly scale with massive real-world robot data? Understanding the scaling behavior of VLA models is crucial for robotic learning, especially on vast and diverse real-world datasets. In this work, we provide systematic empirical investigation into how success rates scale with respect to data volume and diversity during VLA pre-training By scaling pre-training data from 3,000 hours to 20,000 hours, we demonstrate that downstream success rates improve consistently and substantially. Notably, this scaling behavior shows no signs of saturation even at the 20,000-hour mark, suggesting that VLA performance continues to benefit from increased data volume. These results provide the first empirical evidence of favorable scaling properties in real-world robot learning, offering critical insights for future VLA development and large-scale data curation. While scaling analysis reveals favorable performance trends, translating these insights into reliable, deployable systems necessitates rigorous evaluation on real robotic platforms at large scale. Thanks to GM-100 [29], which provides 100 carefully designed tasks, we conduct systematic assessment across 3 robotic platforms, involving 130 episodes per task per embodiment. By emphasizing task diversity and multi-platform consistency, our evaluation framework provides choice of new standards for sound VLA benchmarking. 1 Figure 1. Overview of LingBot-VLA. We scale dual-arm robot data collected in the real world for pre-training. LingBot-VLA can be easily and efficiently transferred to downstream tasks. Moreover, we conduct systematic assessment across three robotic embodiments, which demonstrates the clear superiority of our model. In this paper, we present LingBot-VLA, pragmatic VLA foundation model trained on about 20,000 hours of real-world manipulation data from 9 robotic platforms. Our systematic evaluation on the comprehensive benchmark, demonstrates that LingBot-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance and exceptional generalization compared to existing methods. Beyond model capabilities, we emphasize that large-scale robot learning necessitates high computational efficiency. To this end, we have developed an optimized codebase that achieves throughput of 261 samples per second per GPU on an 8-GPU cluster. This efficiency gain substantially shortens training cycles and reduces computational overhead, thereby lowering the overall costs. By combining superior performance, broad generalizability, and computational efficiency, LingBot-VLA is well-positioned for real-world robotic applications. To foster community progress, we provide open access to the code, base model, and benchmark data, with focus on enabling more challenging tasks and promoting sound evaluation standards.Foundation VLA. Vision-language-action foundation models typically adopt powerful pre-trained vision-language model [2, 3] as the semantic backbone, coupled with diffusion-based action head. Recent VLA foundation models [4 7, 13, 26, 27, 32, 33] have demonstrated enhanced multi-task execution capabilities and superior multi-embodiment adaptability, following pre-training on larger-scale and increasingly diverse datasets. Distinguishing itself from the datasets utilized in preceding VLA foundation models, our model is pre-trained on an extensive corpus approximate 20,000 hours of multi-embodiment data. This massive-scale dataset, characterized by its high behavioral diversity, significantly bolsters the models generalization capabilities across various robotic manipulation tasks. 2 Spatial VLA. While traditional VLA models excel at semantic understanding, they often struggle with precise geometric reasoning and depth perception required for complex spatial manipulation. To address this, several works [9, 11, 14, 21, 23, 25, 32] have integrated spatial representations into the VLA framework. Several research [9, 26, 32] initiatives have focused on bolstering the spatial awareness of VLMs within embodied scenarios to enhance the spatial manipulation capabilities of VLAs in downstre"

"A Vision-Language-Action model trained on extensive real-world robotic data demonstrates superior performance and generalization across multiple platforms while offering enhanced efficiency through optimized training infrastructure.  					AI-generated summary 				 Offering great potential in robotic manipulation, a capable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation model is expected to faithfully generalize across tasks and platforms while ensuring cost efficiency (e.g., data and GPU hours required for adaptation). To this end, we develop LingBot-VLA with around 20,000 hours of real-world data from 9 popular dual-arm robot configurations. Through a systematic assessment on 3 robotic platforms, each completing 100 tasks with 130 post-training episodes per task, our model achieves clear superiority over competitors, showcasing its strong performance and broad generalizability. We have also built an efficient codebase, which delivers a throughput of 261 samples per second per GPU with an 8-GPU training setup, representing a 1.5~2.8times (depending on the relied VLM base model) speedup over existing VLA-oriented codebases. The above features ensure that our model is well-suited for real-world deployment. To advance the field of robot learning, we provide open access to the code, base model, and benchmark data, with a focus on enabling more challenging tasks and promoting sound evaluation standards."

World Craft enables non-expert users to create executable and visualizable AI environments through textual descriptions by combining structured scaffolding and multi-agent intent analysis.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) motivate generative agent simulation (e.g., AI Town) to create a ``dynamic world'', holding immense value across entertainment and research. However, for non-experts, especially those without programming skills, it isn't easy to customize a visualizable environment by themselves. In this paper, we introduce World Craft, an agentic world creation framework to create an executable and visualizable AI Town via user textual descriptions. It consists of two main modules, World Scaffold and World Guild. World Scaffold is a structured and concise standardization to develop interactive game scenes, serving as an efficient scaffolding for LLMs to customize an executable AI Town-like environment. World Guild is a multi-agent framework to progressively analyze users' intents from rough descriptions, and synthesizes required structured contents (\eg environment layout and assets) for World Scaffold . Moreover, we construct a high-quality error-correction dataset via reverse engineering to enhance spatial knowledge and improve the stability and controllability of layout generation, while reporting multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing commercial code agents (Cursor and Antigravity) and LLMs (Qwen3 and Gemini-3-Pro). in scene construction and narrative intent conveyance, providing a scalable solution for the democratization of environment creation.
