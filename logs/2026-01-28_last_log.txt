Text:"Post-LayerNorm Is Back: Stable, ExpressivE, and Deep Chen Chen, Lai Wei,Equal Contribution, Corresponding authorsLarge language model (LLM) scaling is hitting wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with Highway-style connection, provides simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures. Date: January 28, 2026 Correspondence: Lai Wei at laiwei.future@bytedance.com 6 2 0 2 7 2 ] . [ 1 5 9 8 9 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r (a) Training Stability (b) Expressiveness (c) Depth Scaling Figure 1 KEEL enables stable, expressive, and deep LLM training. (a) Training Stability: Keel maintains smooth convergence at aggressive learning rates, while Pre-LN exhibits severe instability under the same configuration. (b) Expressiveness: Keel demonstrates superior performance across all capability domains, particularly in Math & Code (+16.5%). (c) Depth Scaling: Keel consistently outperforms Pre-LN across all depths (64-1024 layers). Together, these results demonstrate that Keels architectural improvements enable stable optimization of ultra-deep networks with enhanced learning efficiency and model expressiveness.Large language model (LLM) progress has been driven primarily by scaling: bigger models, longer context windows, and larger training corpora. Yet these conventional scaling axes are beginning to show diminishing returns. Width scaling saturates quickly, context scaling grows increasingly expensive, and parameter growth alone does not unlock qualitatively new behaviors. As result, LLM scaling is hitting wall, and there is increasing interest in architectural directions that can deliver more expressivity per parameter. Depth scaling offers promising path forward. In principle, deeper networks can represent exponentially richer functions and support more hierarchical reasoning. However, current LLM architectures struggle to capitalize on depth. Training becomes increasingly unstable at extreme depths, and even when optimization succeeds, depth scaling delivers substantially worse returns than width scaling under current architectures. The placement of Layer Normalization (LN), which is seemingly simple architectural choice, has an enormous effect on depth scaling. The original Transformer architecture used Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN), but modern LLMs overwhelmingly adopt Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) [4, 25]. Pre-LN stabilizes early training by normalizing each sublayers input, preventing the divergence commonly seen in deep Post-LN networks [29]. However, Pre-LN introduces its own structural limitations: it weakens gradient propagation and reduces the effective contribution of deeper layers [17]. As models grow deeper, this results in poor depth scaling and representational expressivity, limiting the potential of depth as new scaling axis. In contrast, Post-LN maintains large gradient signals in deeper layers, which can support superior depth scaling. Yet its training instability has made it unsuitable for LLM-scale models. When the residual output and transformed features are summed and then normalized, gradients in LayerNorm can exhibit extreme variability, especially in deep regimes [29]. Previous attempts to revive Post-LN, such as DeepNorm [27], Admin [15], and more recent hybrid normalization strategies [14, 35], mitigate some failure modes but do not fundamentally resolve the gradient pathologies of Post-LN LLMs, nor do they demonstrate reliable behavior at the depths needed to break the scaling limits of today. To understand the root cause of these instabilities, we formally analyze the gradient dynamics of Post-LN. We derive bounds on the backward signal and show that the ResNet-style residual path is the primary source of gradient vanishing. These issues arise not from normalization itself, but from the way that residual and transformed activations are mixed before normalization. Motivated by this analysis, we consider small yet impactful architectural change: replace the ResNet-style residual branch with simplified Highway-style connection, and re-express its gradient dynamics under the same theoretical framework. Our results show that this Highway-style pathway provides provable control of gradient magnitudes, allowing signals to propagate through depth without vanishing. Crucially, it maintains the inter-layer coupling that makes Post-LN expressive, while suppressing the unstable mixing that previously made Post-LN difficult to train. Guided by these findings, we introduce Keel, Post-LN architecture that incorporates lightweight Highwaystyle gated connection [21]. The gate dynamically balances carry and transform signals, regulating both forward and backward information flow. This simple modification stabilizes Post-LN at scale, enabling it to realize its expressivity advantages without special initialization or customized residual scaling. Empirically, Keel delivers substantial gains in depth scalability and model performance, effectively addressing the training stability issues often associated with traditional deep architectures. By integrating Highwaystyle pathway with revived Post-LN configuration, Keel enables robust training at depths exceeding 1000 layers.1 While standard Post-LN or Pre-LN architectures often exhibit severe instability when subjected to aggressive learning rates, Keel maintains smooth convergence, suggesting more well-conditione"

A novel Post-LayerNorm Transformer architecture called Keel addresses training instability in extremely deep networks by replacing residual connections with Highway-style connections, enabling stable training beyond 1000 layers.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language model (LLM) scaling is hitting a wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.

Hallucinated citations, defined as false references to non-existent works, are prevalent in recent NLP conference publications, with significant implications for scientific reliability and conference credibility.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, we have often observed hallucinated citations or references that do not correspond to any existing work in papers under review, preprints, or published papers. Such hallucinated citations pose a serious concern to scientific reliability. When they appear in accepted papers, they may also negatively affect the credibility of conferences. In this study, we refer to hallucinated citations as "HalluCitation" and systematically investigate their prevalence and impact. We analyze all papers published at ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP in 2024 and 2025, including main conference, Findings, and workshop papers. Our analysis reveals that nearly 300 papers contain at least one HalluCitation, most of which were published in 2025. Notably, half of these papers were identified at EMNLP 2025, the most recent conference, indicating that this issue is rapidly increasing. Moreover, more than 100 such papers were accepted as main conference and Findings papers at EMNLP 2025, affecting the credibility.

A revised mathematical benchmark dataset was created through manual auditing to reduce noise and improve model performance assessment accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Benchmarks are important tools to track progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet inaccuracies in datasets and evaluation methods consistently undermine their effectiveness. Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset (n{=}4181) and a tagged, non-standard subset (n{=}247). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in 96.4% of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.

"A revised mathematical benchmark dataset was created through manual auditing to reduce noise and improve model performance assessment accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Benchmarks are important tools to track progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet inaccuracies in datasets and evaluation methods consistently undermine their effectiveness. Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset (n{=}4181) and a tagged, non-standard subset (n{=}247). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in 96.4% of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance."
