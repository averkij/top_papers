[13.11.2024 07:09] Abstract 0. 3D part segmentation is a crucial and challenging task in 3D perception, playing a vital role in applications such as robotics, 3D generation, and 3D editing. Recent methods harness the powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) for 2D-to-3D knowledge distillation, achieving zero-shot 3D part segmentati...

Prompt: Read an abstract of the ML paper and return a JSON with fields: 'desc': explanation of the paper in Russian (4 sentences), use correct machine learning terms. 'emoji': emoji that will reflect the theme of an article somehow, only one emoji. 'title': a slogan of a main idea of the article in Russian. Return only JSON and nothing else.

We present JanusFlow, a powerful framework that unifies image understanding and generation in a single model. JanusFlow introduces a minimalist architecture that integrates autoregressive language models with rectified flow, a state-of-the-art method in generative modeling. Our key finding demonstrates that rectified flow can be straightforwardly trained within the large language model framework, eliminating the need for complex architectural modifications. To further improve the performance of our unified model, we adopt two key strategies: (i) decoupling the understanding and generation encoders, and (ii) aligning their representations during unified training. Extensive experiments show that JanusFlow achieves comparable or superior performance to specialized models in their respective domains, while significantly outperforming existing unified approaches across standard benchmarks. This work represents a step toward more efficient and versatile vision-language models.
