Text:"Phi-4-reasoning Technical ReportHarkirat Behl Suriya Gunasekar Mojan Javaheripi Neel Joshi Piero Kauffmann Yash Lara Caio César Teodoro Mendes Arindam MitraSafoora Yousefi Guoqing ZhengWe introduce Phi-4-reasoning, 14-billion parameter reasoning model that achieves strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. Trained via supervised fine-tuning of Phi-4 on carefully curated set of teachable promptsselected for the right level of complexity and diversityand reasoning demonstrations generated using o3-mini, Phi-4-reasoning generates detailed reasoning chains that effectively leverage inference-time compute. We further develop Phi-4-reasoning-plus, variant enhanced through short phase of outcome-based reinforcement learning that offers higher performance by generating longer reasoning traces. Across wide range of reasoning tasks, both models outperform significantly larger open-weight models such as DeepSeekR1-Distill-Llama-70B model and approach the performance levels of full DeepSeek-R1 model. Our comprehensive evaluations span benchmarks in math and scientific reasoning, coding, algorithmic problem solving, planning, and spatial understanding. Interestingly, we observe non-trivial transfer of improvements to general-purpose benchmarks as well. In this report, we provide insights into our training data, our training methodologies, and our evaluations. We show that the benefit of careful data curation for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) extends to reasoning language models, and can be further amplified by reinforcement learning (RL). Finally, our evaluation points to opportunities for improving how we assess the performance and robustness of reasoning models. 5 2 0 2 0 3 ] . [ 1 8 1 3 1 2 . 4 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Phi-4-reasoning performance across representative reasoning benchmarks spanning mathematical (HMMT, AIME 25, OmniMath), scientific (GPQA), and coding (LiveCodeBench 8/24-1/25) domains. We illustrate the performance gains from reasoning-focused post-training of Phi-4 via Phi-4-reasoning (SFT) and Phi-4-reasoning-plus (SFT+RL), alongside: open-weight models from DeepSeek including DeepSeek-R1 (671B Mixture-of-Experts) and its distilled dense variant DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, and OpenAIs proprietary frontier models o1 and o3-mini. Phi-4-reasoning and Phi-4-reasoning-plus consistently outperform the base model Phi-4 and demonstrate competitive performance against substantially larger and state-of-the-art models. more comprehensive evaluation is provided in Section 5. alphabetical order, correspondences to phi-research@microsoft.comReasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) are trained to perform complex tasks that demand multi-step decomposition, internal reflection, and exploration of multiple problem-solving strategies. Recent reasoning models exhibit these capabilities via form of inference-time scaling, wherein greater computational effort is dynamically allocated during inference for more complex tasks, resulting in improved performance in domains such as mathematical problem solving, logical reasoning, and answering questions that require deeper contextual understanding. Several frontier models now have reasoning-optimized variations, including OpenAIs o1, o3(- mini) [43], Anthropics Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking [7], Googles Gemini-2-Thinking and Gemini-2.5-Flash [18], and DeepSeek-AIs DeepSeek-R1 [21]. In parallel, multiple open-weight reasoning models have been introduced to the research community [58, 52, 19, 21]. DeepSeek-R1 [21] also pioneered family of distilled open-weight models, demonstrating that the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models can be distilled into smaller models through supervised fine-tuning. Follow-up work [59, 34, 61, 15] has shown that these smaller models can be further improved via reinforcement learning. These findings underscore the potential of combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to develop efficient, high-performing small language models with strong reasoning ability. In this work, we curate new family of small reasoning models by integrating these insights with data-centric approach. We present Phi-4-reasoning, 14-billion parameter model supervised fine-tuned on Phi-4 [2], and Phi-4-reasoningplus obtained by further round of reinforcement learning. Phi-4-reasoning is trained on high-quality datasets with over 1.4M prompts and high-quality answers containing long reasoning traces generated using o3-mini. The prompts are specifically filtered to cover range of difficulty levels and to lie at the boundary of the base model capabilities. The datasets used in supervised fine-tuning include topics in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), coding, and safety-focused tasks. Phi-4-reasoning-plus is further trained with Reinforcement Learning on small set of 6K high-quality math-focused problems with verifiable solutions. Contributions: We highlight the benefits of careful data curation and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for reasoning language models. More specifically, we show the importance of the selection and filtering of prompts and responses, as well as the critical role of data mixture and training recipe. We detail this data and supervised finetuning recipe that is at the core of the model in Sections 2-3. Our approach aligns closely with data-centric methods of earlier Phi and Orca models [20, 28, 1, 2, 41, 38, 39], demonstrating that meticulous data curation and high-quality synthetic datasets allow smaller models to compete with larger counterparts. Secondly, we are encouraged by the gains achieved through reinforcement learning (RL) and the potential of combining distillation/SFT and reinforcement learning. we plan to explore this area further especially for domains where SFT data is not available (Section 4). Lastly, we conduct comprehensive evaluation to assess the performance and robustness of our models. We note the need to establish more rigorous practices for evaluating reasoning models that account for the small size of the commonly used benchmarks and the inherent non-determinism exhibited by the models (Section 5) We summarize the key observations on model performance below. Performance compared to other models: Despite their smaller size (14B parameters), the performance of both models is competitive with or exceeding much larger models across several benchmarks as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 8. For example, they achieve better performance than o1-mini and Deep"

[ 1 3 3 2 1 2 . 4 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Math benchmark performance of Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning. Equal Contribution. Except for the first and last two authors, the remaining authors are listed in alphabetical order.Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous natural language processing tasks, while their reasoning ability often deteriorates when confronting intricate, multi-step problems, where simply outputting an answer without intermediate steps leads to significant performance gaps (Wei et al., 2022). The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach addresses this challenge by explicitly prompting models to generate sequence of logical steps prior to arriving at final answer, thereby significantly enhancing their reasoning capacities (Kojima et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022). Incorporating this reasoning process during inference has established the paradigm of test-time scaling, which further elevates performance in complex reasoning tasks (Snell et al., 2024; Welleck et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2024). Enhancing reasoning abilities is inherently easier for larger LLMs due to their extensive capacity, whereas it remains challenging for Small Language Models (SLMs). Fortunately, Deepseek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025) indicates that non-logits-level distillationeffectively supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of SLMs using synthetic data generated by more capable modelscan markedly improve SLM reasoning performance. For instance, such an approach could elevate MATH-500 (Lightman et al., 2023) accuracy of Llama-8B (Grattafiori et al., 2024) from 44.4% to 89.1% . Following this breakthrough, numerous efforts, including Bespoke-Stratos-7B (Labs, 2025) and OpenThinker-7B (OpenThoughts, 2025), have aimed to replicate these results. Despite this enthusiasm, debates persist regarding the primary focus of training. Deepscaler (Luo et al., 2025) suggests scaling RL like GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) for reasoning gains, while S1 and LIMO (Muennighoff et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2025b) emphasize the quality and diversity of reasoning datasets, revealing that even datasets as small as fewer than 1K examples can enhance reasoning performance. Rather than focusing on isolated techniques that individually benefit training, we systematically explore training paradigm specifically tailored for SLMs, where limited model capacity makes reasoning improvements particularly challenging. Our methodology consists of two stages of distillation, followed by rollout-based preference learning that also reuses wrong LLM-generated samples, and concludes with RL using verifiable reward. Initially, we employ distillation as mid-training mechanism to embed foundational reasoning capabilities. We then apply distillation again in fine-tuning phase to further improve model generalization. During LLM rollout sampling for distillation, some incorrect outputs are typically discarded; however, we re-purpose these discarded samples to create customized preference dataset, which is used for preference learning applied on top of the distilled model. Finally, we fine-tune the model using reinforcement learning with verifiable reward signal based on final answer correctness. To ensure stable training, we introduce several targeted improvements, including prompt optimization, reward re-balancing via oversampling and filtering, and temperature annealing during exploration. We validate our proposed approach using Phi-4-Mini (Microsoft et al., 2025), compact 3.8-billionparameter model, resulting in Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning, which outperforms other reasoning models nearly twice its size, such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.Small language models (SLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for strong reasoning capabilities. For example, Qwen-1.5B can achieve 83.9% accuracy on the Math-500 (Lightman et al., 2023) benchmark simply by distilling 800K examples from DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025). Distillation has emerged as powerful tool to enhance the reasoning abilities of SLMs; however, the optimal distillation strategy for small models remains underexplored. Recent studies provide complementary insights: Luo et al. (2025) suggests that gradually increasing generation length via reinforcement learning can further improve 2 distilled models, while Muennighoff et al. (2025) and Ye et al. (2025b) emphasize that data diversity and quality, rather than quantity alone, are critical to success. Despite these advances, comprehensive understanding of an effective distillation recipe for SLMs is still lacking. Moreover, naively applying isolated techniques can lead to degraded performance. For instance, directly distilling S1K (Muennighoff et al., 2025) or LIMO (Ye et al., 2025b) datasets onto Phi-4-Mini results in significant drop in reasoning performance. This observation sugge"

Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate impressive long-horizon reasoning capabilities. However, their reliance on static internal knowledge limits their performance on complex, knowledge-intensive tasks and hinders their ability to produce comprehensive research reports requiring synthesis of diverse web information. To address this, we propose WebThinker, a deep research agent that empowers LRMs to autonomously search the web, navigate web pages, and draft research reports during the reasoning process. WebThinker integrates a Deep Web Explorer module, enabling LRMs to dynamically search, navigate, and extract information from the web when encountering knowledge gaps. It also employs an Autonomous Think-Search-and-Draft strategy, allowing the model to seamlessly interleave reasoning, information gathering, and report writing in real time. To further enhance research tool utilization, we introduce an RL-based training strategy via iterative online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks (GPQA, GAIA, WebWalkerQA, HLE) and scientific report generation tasks (Glaive) demonstrate that WebThinker significantly outperforms existing methods and strong proprietary systems. Our approach enhances LRM reliability and applicability in complex scenarios, paving the way for more capable and versatile deep research systems. The code is available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/WebThinker.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at simple vision-language tasks but struggle when faced with complex tasks that require multiple capabilities, such as simultaneously recognizing objects, counting them, and understanding their spatial relationships. This might be partially the result of the fact that Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT), a critical training step for MLLMs, has traditionally focused on scaling data volume, but not the compositional complexity of training examples. We propose COMPACT (COMPositional Atomic-to-complex visual Capability Tuning), which generates a training dataset explicitly controlling for the compositional complexity of the training examples. The data from COMPACT allows MLLMs to train on combinations of atomic capabilities to learn complex capabilities more efficiently. Across all benchmarks, COMPACT achieves comparable performance to the LLaVA-665k VIT while using less than 10% of its data budget, and even outperforms it on several, especially those involving complex multi-capability tasks. For example, COMPACT achieves substantial 83.3% improvement on MMStar and 94.0% improvement on MM-Vet compared to the full-scale VIT on particularly complex questions that require four or more atomic capabilities. COMPACT offers a scalable, data-efficient, visual compositional tuning recipe to improve on complex visual-language tasks.

We introduce Phi-4-reasoning, a 14-billion parameter reasoning model that achieves strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. Trained via supervised fine-tuning of Phi-4 on carefully curated set of "teachable" prompts-selected for the right level of complexity and diversity-and reasoning demonstrations generated using o3-mini, Phi-4-reasoning generates detailed reasoning chains that effectively leverage inference-time compute. We further develop Phi-4-reasoning-plus, a variant enhanced through a short phase of outcome-based reinforcement learning that offers higher performance by generating longer reasoning traces. Across a wide range of reasoning tasks, both models outperform significantly larger open-weight models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B model and approach the performance levels of full DeepSeek-R1 model. Our comprehensive evaluations span benchmarks in math and scientific reasoning, coding, algorithmic problem solving, planning, and spatial understanding. Interestingly, we observe a non-trivial transfer of improvements to general-purpose benchmarks as well. In this report, we provide insights into our training data, our training methodologies, and our evaluations. We show that the benefit of careful data curation for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) extends to reasoning language models, and can be further amplified by reinforcement learning (RL). Finally, our evaluation points to opportunities for improving how we assess the performance and robustness of reasoning models.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) significantly enhances formal reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) by training them to explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps. While LLMs readily benefit from such techniques, improving reasoning in Small Language Models (SLMs) remains challenging due to their limited model capacity. Recent work by Deepseek-R1 demonstrates that distillation from LLM-generated synthetic data can substantially improve the reasoning ability of SLM. However, the detailed modeling recipe is not disclosed. In this work, we present a systematic training recipe for SLMs that consists of four steps: (1) large-scale mid-training on diverse distilled long-CoT data, (2) supervised fine-tuning on high-quality long-CoT data, (3) Rollout DPO leveraging a carefully curated preference dataset, and (4) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Verifiable Reward. We apply our method on Phi-4-Mini, a compact 3.8B-parameter model. The resulting Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning model exceeds, on math reasoning tasks, much larger reasoning models, e.g., outperforming DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B by 3.2 points and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B by 7.7 points on Math-500. Our results validate that a carefully designed training recipe, with large-scale high-quality CoT data, is effective to unlock strong reasoning capabilities even in resource-constrained small models.

Data scaling and standardized evaluation benchmarks have driven significant advances in natural language processing and computer vision. However, robotics faces unique challenges in scaling data and establishing evaluation protocols. Collecting real-world data is resource-intensive and inefficient, while benchmarking in real-world scenarios remains highly complex. Synthetic data and simulation offer promising alternatives, yet existing efforts often fall short in data quality, diversity, and benchmark standardization. To address these challenges, we introduce RoboVerse, a comprehensive framework comprising a simulation platform, a synthetic dataset, and unified benchmarks. Our simulation platform supports multiple simulators and robotic embodiments, enabling seamless transitions between different environments. The synthetic dataset, featuring high-fidelity physics and photorealistic rendering, is constructed through multiple approaches. Additionally, we propose unified benchmarks for imitation learning and reinforcement learning, enabling evaluation across different levels of generalization. At the core of the simulation platform is MetaSim, an infrastructure that abstracts diverse simulation environments into a universal interface. It restructures existing simulation environments into a simulator-agnostic configuration system, as well as an API aligning different simulator functionalities, such as launching simulation environments, loading assets with initial states, stepping the physics engine, etc. This abstraction ensures interoperability and extensibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RoboVerse enhances the performance of imitation learning, reinforcement learning, world model learning, and sim-to-real transfer. These results validate the reliability of our dataset and benchmarks, establishing RoboVerse as a robust solution for advancing robot learning.

In recent years, video generation has seen significant advancements. However, challenges still persist in generating complex motions and interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce ReVision, a plug-and-play framework that explicitly integrates parameterized 3D physical knowledge into a pretrained conditional video generation model, significantly enhancing its ability to generate high-quality videos with complex motion and interactions. Specifically, ReVision consists of three stages. First, a video diffusion model is used to generate a coarse video. Next, we extract a set of 2D and 3D features from the coarse video to construct a 3D object-centric representation, which is then refined by our proposed parameterized physical prior model to produce an accurate 3D motion sequence. Finally, this refined motion sequence is fed back into the same video diffusion model as additional conditioning, enabling the generation of motion-consistent videos, even in scenarios involving complex actions and interactions. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on Stable Video Diffusion, where ReVision significantly improves motion fidelity and coherence. Remarkably, with only 1.5B parameters, it even outperforms a state-of-the-art video generation model with over 13B parameters on complex video generation by a substantial margin. Our results suggest that, by incorporating 3D physical knowledge, even a relatively small video diffusion model can generate complex motions and interactions with greater realism and controllability, offering a promising solution for physically plausible video generation.

"In recent years, video generation has seen significant advancements. However, challenges still persist in generating complex motions and interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce ReVision, a plug-and-play framework that explicitly integrates parameterized 3D physical knowledge into a pretrained conditional video generation model, significantly enhancing its ability to generate high-quality videos with complex motion and interactions. Specifically, ReVision consists of three stages. First, a video diffusion model is used to generate a coarse video. Next, we extract a set of 2D and 3D features from the coarse video to construct a 3D object-centric representation, which is then refined by our proposed parameterized physical prior model to produce an accurate 3D motion sequence. Finally, this refined motion sequence is fed back into the same video diffusion model as additional conditioning, enabling the generation of motion-consistent videos, even in scenarios involving complex actions and interactions. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on Stable Video Diffusion, where ReVision significantly improves motion fidelity and coherence. Remarkably, with only 1.5B parameters, it even outperforms a state-of-the-art video generation model with over 13B parameters on complex video generation by a substantial margin. Our results suggest that, by incorporating 3D physical knowledge, even a relatively small video diffusion model can generate complex motions and interactions with greater realism and controllability, offering a promising solution for physically plausible video generation."
