Jerzak Priyanshi Chandra Rishi Hazra April 29,Conjoint analysis, an application of factorial experimental design, is popular tool in social science research for studying multidimensional preferences. In such experiments in the political analysis context, respondents are asked to choose between two hypothetical political candidates with randomly selected features, which can include partisanship, policy positions, gender and race. We consider the problem of identifying optimal candidate profiles. Because the number of unique feature combinations far exceeds the total number of observations in typical conjoint experiment, it is impossible to determine the optimal profile exactly. To address this identification challenge, we derive an optimal stochastic intervention that represents probability distribution of various attributes aimed at achieving the most favorable average outcome. We first consider an environment where one political party optimizes their candidate selection. We then move to the more realistic case where two political parties optimize their own candidate selection simultaneously and in opposition to each other. We apply the proposed methodology to an existing candidate choice conjoint experiment concerning vote choice for US president. We find that, in contrast to the non-adversarial approach, expected outcomes in the adversarial regime fall within range of historical electoral outcomes, with optimal strategies suggested by the method more likely to match the actual observed candidates compared to strategies derived from non-adversarial approach. These findings indicate that incorporating adversarial dynamics into conjoint analysis may yield unique insight into social science data from experiments.

Introduction Over the past decade, conjoint analysis, which is an application of high-dimensional factorial design, has become the most popular survey experiment methodology to study multidimensional preferences (Hainmueller et al., 2014). One of the most common political science applications of conjoint analysis is the evaluation of candidate profiles (e.g., Bansak, Hainmueller, Hopkins, Yamamoto, et al., 2021; Berz and Jankowski, 2022; Christensen et al., 2021; Franchino and Zucchini, 2015; Kirkland and Coppock, 2018; Ono and Burden, 2019; Rehmert, 2022). In such experiments, respondents are asked to choose between two hypothetical political candidates whose features (e.g., gender, race, age, education, partisanship, and policy positions) are randomly selected. Most researchers then proceed by estimating the average causal effect of each feature while marginalizing the remaining features over particular distribution of choice. This popular quantity of interest is termed the Average Marginal Component Effect (AMCE) (Hainmueller et al., 2014). One important property of the AMCE is that it depends upon the distribution of other features used for marginalization (de la Cuesta et al., 2019). Although many researchers simply use the uniform distribution, this seemingly innocuous choice implies that the AMCE is applicable only when other features are independently and randomly selected with equal probabilities. While the choice of feature distribution becomes irrelevant once we assume the absence of interaction between features, such an assumption is at odds with the main motivation for the use of conjoint analysis. Substantively, in the case of candidate choice experiment, the use of the uniform distribution means that we are evaluating one feature of candidate profile against an opponent with randomly selected features while also randomly selecting the other features of the candidate. In practice, however, political actors, such as parties, face an adversarial setting in which each party is strategically fielding its own candidate in order to maximize the probability of electoral victory. These strategic considerations make it difficult to justify the common assumption of randomly selected features in most existing analyses of conjoint experiments. To address this problem, we consider the identification of optimal candidate profiles in an adversarial environment where each party simultaneously chooses its own candidate to maximize the expected vote share. Specifically, we consider an adversarial environment where candidate profiles of each party face two stages of competition: first, intra-party competition at the primary election stage and, second, inter-party competition at the general election stage. To the best of our knowledge, the problem of optimal profile selection has not been considered in the conjoint analysis literature, regardless of whether or not the environment is adversarial. Therefore, before moving on to the adversarial setting where both candidates are optimized, we first consider the case where party maximizes expected electoral performance against static opponent. One methodological challenge for optimal candidate selection is the fact that in typical conjoint experiment, the total number of feature combinations far exceeds its sample size. This means that many profiles are not observed in the data, so it is generally impossible to determine from observed data the optimal candidate profile. We address this identification problem by deriving an optimal stochastic intervention, which in our application represents probability distribution of candidate characteristics. Unlike the case of finding fixed, optimal treatment, the"

Conjoint analysis, an application of factorial experimental design, is a popular tool in social science research for studying multidimensional preferences. In such experiments in the political analysis context, respondents are asked to choose between two hypothetical political candidates with randomly selected features, which can include partisanship, policy positions, gender and race. We consider the problem of identifying optimal candidate profiles. Because the number of unique feature combinations far exceeds the total number of observations in a typical conjoint experiment, it is impossible to determine the optimal profile exactly. To address this identification challenge, we derive an optimal stochastic intervention that represents a probability distribution of various attributes aimed at achieving the most favorable average outcome. We first consider an environment where one political party optimizes their candidate selection. We then move to the more realistic case where two political parties optimize their own candidate selection simultaneously and in opposition to each other. We apply the proposed methodology to an existing candidate choice conjoint experiment concerning vote choice for US president. We find that, in contrast to the non-adversarial approach, expected outcomes in the adversarial regime fall within range of historical electoral outcomes, with optimal strategies suggested by the method more likely to match the actual observed candidates compared to strategies derived from a non-adversarial approach. These findings indicate that incorporating adversarial dynamics into conjoint analysis may yield unique insight into social science data from experiments.

Исследование учитывает как одностороннюю, так и состязательную оптимизацию между двумя партиями. Результаты показывают, что состязательный подход дает более реалистичные прогнозы и лучше соответствует наблюдаемым кандидатам по сравнению с несостязательным методом.",
