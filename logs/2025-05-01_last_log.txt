Text:"5 2 0 2 0 3 ] . [ 1 5 3 6 1 2 . 4 0 5 2 : r Sadeed: Advancing Arabic Diacritization Zeina Aldallal, Sara Chrouf, Khalil Hennara, Mohamed Motaism Hamed, Muhammad Hreden, and Safwan AlModhayan Khobar, Saudi Arabia aldallal,chrouf,hennara,hamed,hreden,safwan@misraj.ai Abstract Arabic text diacritization remains persistent challenge in natural language processing due to the languages morphological richness. In this paper, we introduce Sadeed, novel approach based on fine-tuned decoder-only language model adapted from Kuwain 1.5B Hennara et al. [2025], compact model originally trained on diverse Arabic corpora. Sadeed is fine-tuned on carefully curated, high-quality diacritized datasets, constructed through rigorous data-cleaning and normalization pipeline. Despite utilizing modest computational resources, Sadeed achieves competitive results compared to proprietary large language models and outperforms traditional models trained on similar domains. Additionally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarking practices for Arabic diacritization. To address these issues, we introduce SadeedDiac-25, new benchmark designed to enable fairer and more comprehensive evaluation across diverse text genres and complexity levels. Together, Sadeed and SadeedDiac-25 provide robust foundation for advancing Arabic NLP applications, including machine translation, text-to-speech, and language learning tools. Diacritization, known as tashkÄ±l in Arabic, plays crucial role in disambiguating text. It serves as the primary vocalization system for distinguishing between words that share the same consonantal structure but differ in meaning and pronunciation. Table 1 illustrates this concept with examples of Arabic words that are visually identical but convey different meanings when diacritized. The importance of diacritization goes beyond mere disambiguation. It is essential to improve various Arabic NLP tasks, including Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis Madhfar & Qamar [2021]; Almanea [2021]"
