Text:"5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 4 6 2 3 1 . 7 0 5 2 : r aWe present Voxtral Mini and Voxtral Small, two multimodal audio chat models. Voxtral is trained to comprehend both spoken audio and text documents, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse range of audio benchmarks, while preserving strong text capabilities. Voxtral Small outperforms number of closedsource models, while being small enough to run locally. 32K context window enables the model to handle audio files up to 40 minutes in duration and long multiturn conversations. We also contribute three benchmarks for evaluating speech understanding models on knowledge and trivia. Both Voxtral models are released under Apache 2.0 license. Webpage: https://mistral.ai/news/voxtral/ Model weights: Evals: https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-3Bhttps://huggingface.co/mistralai/Voxtral-Small-24B-2507 https://huggingface.co/collections/mistralai/speech-evals-6875e9b26c78be4a081050fThis paper describes Voxtral Mini and Voxtral Small, pair of multimodal language models trained to understand both speech and text, released with open-weights under an Apache 2.0 license. Voxtral is pretrained on large-scale corpus of audio and text documents, and subsequently instruction tuned on real and synthetic data. It is capable of responding directly to audio (or text) and answering questions about audio files. With 32K token context window, Voxtral is capable of processing audio files up to 40 minutes long. Compared with similarly sized models in the same evaluation setting, we find that Voxtral delivers strong audio reasoning capabilities without sacrificing text-only performance. Its performance is state-of-the-art for speech transcription and translation, outperforming other open-weights and closed models. In speech question-answering (QA) and summarization, it performs comparably with closed models of similar price class, such as GPT-4o mini [Hurst et al., 2024] and Gemini 2.5 Flash [Comanici et al., 2025]. During evaluation of Voxtral and other models, we found that the existing ecosystem of speech evaluations lacked breadth and standardization; the majority of previous work focused on evaluation of transcription and translation quality, and less on other understanding tasks. In Section 3.4, we present evaluations that measure wider range of speech comprehension and reasoning tasks. Our primary contributions are: Two open-weights audio models with state-of-the-art transcription and multilingual speech understanding for audio durations up to their 32K context window Native function calling support with audio Evaluation benchmarks that measure speech understanding and reasoning The report is structured as follows: First, we outline our modeling choices. Next, we describe methods for pretraining, post-training, and response quality enhancement. Finally, we present benchmark results along with architectural and data ablations.Voxtral is based on the Transformer architecture [Vaswani et al., 2017], consisting of three components: an audio encoder to process speech inputs, an adapter layer to downsample audio embeddings, and language decoder to reason and generate text outputs. The overall architecture is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: Voxtral Architecture. The audio encoder processes the speech input, attending to 30-second chunks of audio independently. The audio embeddings are concatenated at the output, and downsampled by factor of 4x in the audio-language adapter. The multimodal LLM decoder auto-regressively predicts text tokens, conditional on the audio and text inputs.The audio encoder is based on Whisper large-v3 [Radford et al., 2023]. raw audio waveform is first mapped to log-Mel spectrogram [Davis and Mermelstein, 1980] with 128 Mel-bins and 160 hop-length. Within the Whisper encoder, the spectrogram passes through convolutional stem that downsamples its temporal resolution by factor of two, after which it is fed into stack of bidirectional self-attention layers. The resulting audio embeddings have frame rate of 50 Hz. Whisper has fixed receptive field of 30 seconds. To accommodate audio sequences exceeding this duration, we compute the log-Mel spectrogram for the entire audio, but restrict the encoder to independently process each 30 second chunk. The absolute positional encodings are reset for each chunk, and chunks from the same audio are partitioned into batch axis. Within the encoders attention layers, this approach is functionally equivalent to chunk-wise attention [Zhang et al., 2023], which mitigates the computational overhead for longer audio inputs and enhances length generalization. The embeddings computed from each chunk are concatenated at the output stage, forming unified representation of the complete audio sequence. Due to its fixed receptive field, Whisper also pads short audios to 30 seconds. In Section 5.1, we investigate removing this padding requirement to allow continuous audio lengths. However, empirical results demonstrated decline in performance, even when tuning the encoder to adapt. Consequently, we maintain the practice of padding all audio inputs to the next multiple of 30 seconds."

AutoSteer, a modular inference-time intervention technology, enhances the safety of Multimodal Large Language Models by reducing attack success rates across various threats without fine-tuning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns, particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.

Voxtral Mini and Voxtral Small are multimodal audio chat models that excel in understanding spoken audio and text, with a 32K context window for handling long audio files and conversations.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Voxtral Mini and Voxtral Small, two multimodal audio chat models. Voxtral is trained to comprehend both spoken audio and text documents, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of audio benchmarks, while preserving strong text capabilities. Voxtral Small outperforms a number of closed-source models, while being small enough to run locally. A 32K context window enables the model to handle audio files up to 40 minutes in duration and long multi-turn conversations. We also contribute three benchmarks for evaluating speech understanding models on knowledge and trivia. Both Voxtral models are released under Apache 2.0 license.
