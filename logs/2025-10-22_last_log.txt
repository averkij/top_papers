On up to 512 H200 GPUs and 512K context length, DistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35, eliminates DP/PP stragglers, and maintains near-perfect compute and memory balance.Recent large language model (LLM) applications show steadily increasing demand for processing longer contexts. For instance, reasoning workloads must generate long chainof-thoughts to yield accurate answers (Guo et al., 2025); coding agents operate over multi-file repositories (Liu et al., 2024b). To reliably support these use cases, LLMs must operate with contexts of 100K - 1M tokens at inference. Equipping an LLM with long-context capability typically requires training on datasets that include long documents in addition to ordinary (short) documents (Gao et al., 2025). standard approach to batch documents of variable length is document packing (Rae et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2024): concatenate multiple documents into fixed-size chunk and apply an attention mask to block cross-document attention. While document packing improves throughput, it leads to variance in the attention compute per chunk therefore load imbalance across different chunks (Lin et al., 2025). The root cause is that self-attention compute in transformers *Equal contribution Work done at UCSD (internship) 1Carnegie Mellon University 2UC SanDiego 3MBZUAI 4StepFun 5UC Berkeley. Eric Xing <epxCorrespondence to: ing@andrew.cmu.edu>, Hao Zhang <haz094@ucsd.edu>. grows quadratically with sequence length, whereas the rest scales approximately linearly. Consequently, two chunks with the same total tokens can incur very different attention FLOPs depending on how documents are distributed. For example, in Figure 1, chunk with single 4K-token document requires roughly 4x the attention FLOPs of chunk packed with four 1K-token documents, even though both contain 4K tokens. This imbalance manifests as stragglers (Figure 1) in largescale distributed training in two ways (Wang et al., 2025c; Lin et al., 2025). First, in data parallelism (DP), replicas process different chunks and synchronize at the gradient barrier; the replica with the largest attention workload stalls the others. Second, in pipeline parallelism (PP) (Huang et al., 2019; Shoeybi et al., 2019), pipeline stages operate on different microbatches concurrently; microbatch with larger attention workload makes its current stage straggler, creating pipeline bubbles which stall the entire pipeline. In hybrid DP and PP, these effects compound, and slowdowns of 1.34-1.44x (Wang et al., 2025c; Lin et al., 2025) have been reported even under modest context lengths. One remedy is to equalize compute by assigning more tokens to devices processing shorter documents (Wang et al., 2025c). This balances compute but unbalances memory, as activation footprints grow with total tokens. In the 41K Efficient Long-context Language Model Training by Core Attention Disaggregation Table 1. Compute and Memory for components in LLMs. is the documents number of tokens. CA Linear MISC Memory 0 O(l) O(l) Compute O(l2) O(l) 0 CA: core attention layer; Linear: FFN, qkvo-proj MISC: layer norm, dropout, ... Figure 1. Transformer and its workload imbalance caused by core attention. Figure 2. DistCA architecture. vs. 14K example: matching the 14K attention FLOPs requires 12 more 1K documents on the 41K device, raising its activation memory by 3. Another remedy, context parallelism (CP) (Liu et al., 2024a; Jacobs et al., 2023), shards each document along the sequence dimension and equally distributes shards across DP replicas, which balances compute and memory, but at the cost of extra communication of KV states. Unfortunately, it cannot mitigate PP stragglers: pipeline stages hold disjoint model layers and cannot jointly compute shards of the same document; straggler microbatches still generate bubbles that stall other stages. Fundamentally, the imbalance stems from mismatched complexity between attention and the rest of the model computations, as illustrated in Table 1. When attention and other layers are colocated and scaled together, the mismatch grows with model scale and context length, leading to severe load imbalance. This naturally leads us to disaggregate attention from the rest of the model, so the attention and non-attention components can be scaled independently to balance workload across devices. challenge, however, is that disaggregation introduces per-layer transfers of inputs and outputs across the attention boundary. At first glance, this communication is prohibitive and could negate its benefits. Surprisingly, we find the opposite: precisely isolating the core attention (CA)the weightless softmax(QK)V computation (Figure 1)and applying targeted overlap and placement optimizations allows the communication to be effectively hidden in todays long-context training workloads. Specifically, we identify two key characteristics of core attention that makes disaggregation effective. First, statelessness: CA contains no trainable"

Text:"Static Sandboxes Are Inadequate: Modeling Societal Complexity Requires Open-Ended Co-Evolution in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Simulations Jinkun Chen1*, Sher Badshah1, Xuemin Yu1, Sijia Han2 1Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada. 2Meta, Vancouver, Canada. *Corresponding author(s). E-mail(s): jinkun.chen@dal.ca; Contributing authors: sh545346@dal.ca; xuemin.yu@dal.ca; hansijia@meta.com; Abstract What if artificial agents could not just communicate, but also evolve, adapt, and reshape their worlds in ways we cannot fully predict? With large language models (LLMs) now powering multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies. In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures that blend LLMs with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling to greater complexity, and introduce fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving field. Finally, we present research roadmap centered on open-endedness, continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI ecosystems. We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent simulations.

CAD, a technique for long-context large language model training, improves throughput and balance by decoupling and distributing core attention computations.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present core attention disaggregation (CAD), a technique that improves long-context large language model training by decoupling the core attention computation, softmax(QK^T)V, from the rest of the model and executing it on a separate pool of devices. In existing systems, core attention is colocated with other layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to the near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers across data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations. First, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only minimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks. Second, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when processing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD partitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to dedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize compute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system called DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap communication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to reduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens, DistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data and pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory balance.

Planned diffusion combines autoregressive and diffusion models to achieve faster text generation with minimal quality loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 A central challenge in large language model inference is the trade-off between generation speed and output quality. Autoregressive models produce high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller, independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\% to 5.4\% drop in win rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.

Any-Depth Alignment (ADA) is an inference-time defense that enhances the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) by reintroducing alignment tokens mid-stream, ensuring robust protection against adversarial attacks without altering the model's parameters.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning (benign or adversarial).

Метод не требует изменения параметров модели и достигает почти 100% отказов на adversarial prefill атаках, снижая успешность популярных adversarial атак (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, TAP) до менее 3%. ADA сохраняет производительность на безопасных задачах с минимальным over-refusal и остаётся эффективным даже после дополнительного файнтюнинга базовой модели."

"Any-Depth Alignment (ADA) is an inference-time defense that enhances the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) by reintroducing alignment tokens mid-stream, ensuring robust protection against adversarial attacks without altering the model's parameters.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning (benign or adversarial)."

Emerging architectures combining LLMs with multi-agent dynamics offer new possibilities for modeling complex, open-ended environments, but require addressing challenges like stability, diversity, and scalability.  					AI-generated summary 				 What if artificial agents could not just communicate, but also evolve, adapt, and reshape their worlds in ways we cannot fully predict? With llm now powering multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies. In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness, continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI ecosystems. We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent simulations.
