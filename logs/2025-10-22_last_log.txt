Text:"Oluwasegun Adegoke George Mason University, Virginia oadegoke@gmu.edu ABSTRACT This paper study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 19702016). We build fully reproducible pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naïve, linear/ARIMA) and deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE 6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6%) and linear lag-regression baseline (+35.4% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE/MAPE. Ablation studies vary temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain, lookback size, and feature groups to identify where performance comes from: models trained on long historical data generalize best; moderate lookback (2030 weeks) provides strong context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide data/ethics statement documenting GTD licensing, research-only use, and limitations (reporting bias, distribution shift). Overall, the study offers transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting. KEYWORDS - Global Terrorism Database (GTD), Spatiotemporal modeling, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Counterterrorism Intelligence, Reproducible research. 1. INTRODUCTION Global terrorism poses significant challenges to national security, economic stability and public safety worldwide. Understanding and forecasting terrorist activities enables proactive countermeasures, making predictive analytics an indispensable tool for security agencies [1]. Short-horizon forecasts of incident volumes or predictions spanning weeks to months [2], support oper"

A Bidirectional LSTM outperforms classical and deep learning baselines in forecasting weekly terrorism incidents using the Global Terrorism Database.  					AI-generated summary 				 We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE 6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE. Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain, lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting.

"A Bidirectional LSTM outperforms classical and deep learning baselines in forecasting weekly terrorism incidents using the Global Terrorism Database.  					AI-generated summary 				 We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE 6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE. Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain, lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting."
