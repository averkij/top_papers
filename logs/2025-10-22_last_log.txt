Recent progress in deep research agents has been driven by two parallel directions: (1) the development of smaller, cost-efficient LLM backbones suitable for scalable deployment [SJM+25, JZY+25, SQG+25, GFX+25, ZFH+25, WZA+25]; and (2) the design of training recipes that interleave reasoning with external actions [TT25, Tea25, LJD+25]. Despite these advances, existing agents remain constrained by several key limitations. First, most training pipelines still depend on token-overlap metrics such as F1 or ROUGE [WZA+25, DCL+25, MHF+25, LZY+25], which correlate weakly with human judgments of usefulness, factual grounding, and instruction adherence. Moreover, current agents exhibit brittle tool-use behavior: single malformed function call, fetch error, or transient API failure can derail an entire trajectory, with little opportunity for self-correction [SWY+25, XHJ+25, SMPN25]. In addition, plausible research threads can miss critical information, producing misleading inferences and therefore incorrect answers, especially for challenging questions. To address these challenges, we introduce PokeeResearch-7B, 7-billion-parameter deep research agent developed under unified reinforcement learning framework optimized for reliability, human alignment, and practical deployment. Our contributions center on three core innovations: Human Value-Driven Training Pipeline: We enhance agent alignment with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) instantiated with the REINFORCE Leave-One-Out (RLOO) algorithm [KvHW19, ACG+24]. RLAIF provides rich, LLM-based reward signals calibrated to human values, including factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction compliance. RLOO offers unbiased gradient estimation in an on-policy fashion for policy improvement. This algorithm distinguishes itself from algorithms that are only approximately on-policy and follow biased gradient direction, such as the PPO family of algorithms. Robust Reasoning Scaffold: To enhance the robustness of our deep research agent, we employ three complementary techniques. Self-correction: Rather than blindly executing potentially malformed tool calls, the agent proactively diagnoses errors and suggests corrections. Self-verification: The agent incorporates an answer verification step that filters out easily detectable false outputs. Research threads synthesis: To improve answer accuracy on challenging questions at test time, the agent launches multiple independent 2 research threads in parallel. These research threads are jointly analyzed and synthesized by the agent to produce the final answer. Together, these design choices yield deep research agent that (1) optimizes directly for human-salient dimensions of answer quality rather than surface overlap; and (2) maintains robustness across imperfect models through adaptive, verifiable reasoning. At 7B scale, PokeeResearch-7B demonstrates that carefully engineered reinforcement learning and reasoning scaffolds can produce research-grade agents that are both cost-efficient and resilient in open-domain settings. We show in 10 benchmarks that PokeeResearch-7B presents state-of-the-art performance among 7B-size deep research agents.In this section, we give review of existing benchmarks for deep research and summarize recent progress in building deep research agents. Information Seeking Benchmarks. The development of sophisticated information retrieval agents has necessitated increasingly complex evaluation benchmarks. Traditional datasets such as Natural Questions [KPR+19] and TriviaQA [JCWZ17] primarily assess single-hop reasoning, which can often be addressed using parametric knowledge or simple query sequences. Their multi-step extensions, including HotpotQA [YQZ+18] and Musique [TBKS22], evaluate structured multi-hop reasoning but remain insufficiently challenging for advanced agents. Recent evaluation frameworks have evolved to present more nuanced challenges: GAIA [MFW+23] introduces real-world complexity requiring sophisticated reasoning chains, while WebWalkerQA [WYJ+25] emphasizes dynamic web navigation skills. The BrowseComp suite [WSP+25, ZLY+25] establishes standardized metrics for web browsing competency across multiple languages. At the frontier o"

STEAM, a back-translation-based detection method, enhances multilingual watermarking robustness across various languages by addressing semantic clustering failures.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multilingual watermarking aims to make large language model (LLM) outputs traceable across languages, yet current methods still fall short. Despite claims of cross-lingual robustness, they are evaluated only on high-resource languages. We show that existing multilingual watermarking methods are not truly multilingual: they fail to remain robust under translation attacks in medium- and low-resource languages. We trace this failure to semantic clustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few full-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a back-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost through translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust across different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable to new languages. With average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17 languages, STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking across diverse languages.

PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent, achieves state-of-the-art performance using reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance robustness and alignment.  					AI-generated summary 				 Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability. PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This highlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce efficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents. The model and inference code is open-sourced under MIT license at https://github.com/Pokee-AI/PokeeResearchOSS.

"PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent, achieves state-of-the-art performance using reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance robustness and alignment.  					AI-generated summary 				 Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability. PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This highlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce efficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents.
