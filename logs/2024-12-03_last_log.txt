Metaxas, Yezhou Yang Arizona State University {maitreya.patel, yz.yang}@asu.edu Rutgers University {song.wen, dnm}@rutgers.edu Figure 1. FlowChef steers the trajectory of Rectified Flow Models during inference to tackle linear inverse problems, image editing, and classifier guidance. We extend FlowChef to SOTA models like Flux and InstaFlow, enabling gradientand inversion-free control for efficient, controlled image generation. Abstract Diffusion models (DMs) excel in photorealism, image editing, and solving inverse problems, aided by classifierfree guidance and image inversion techniques. However, rectified flow models (RFMs) remain underexplored for these tasks. Existing DM-based methods often require additional training, lack generalization to pretrained latent models, underperform, and demand significant computational resources due to extensive backpropagation through ODE solvers and inversion processes. In this work, we first develop theoretical and empirical understanding of the vector field dynamics of RFMs in efficiently guiding the denoising trajectory. Our findings reveal that we can navigate the vector field in deterministic and gradient-free manner. Utilizing this property, we propose FlowChef, which leverages the vector field to steer the denoising trajectory for controlled image generation tasks, facilitated by gradient skipping. FlowChef is unified framework for controlled image generation that, for the first time, simultaneously addresses classifier guidance, linear inverse problems, and image editing without the need for extra training, inversion, or intensive backpropagation. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations and show that FlowChef significantly outperforms baselines in terms of performance, memory, and time requirements, achieving new state-ofthe-art results.

Text:"VisOnlyQA: Large Vision Language Models Still Struggle with Visual Perception of Geometric Information Penn State University {ryokamoi, rmz5227}@psu.edu 4 2 0 2 1 ] . [ 1 7 4 9 0 0 . 2 1 4 2 : r a information in images (i.e., visual perception errors) remain major source of mistakes in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). While further analysis is essential, there is deficiency in datasets for evaluating the visual perception of LVLMs. In this work, we introduce VisOnlyQA, new dataset designed to directly evaluate the visual perception capabilities of LVLMs on questions about geometric and numerical information in scientific figures. Our dataset enables us to analyze the visual perception of LVLMs for fine-grained visual information, independent of other capabilities such as reasoning. The evaluation set of VisOnlyQA includes 1,200 multiple-choice questions in 12 tasks on four categories of figures. We also provide synthetic training data consisting of 70k instances. Our experiments on VisOnlyQA highlight the following findings: (i) 20 LVLMs we evaluate, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, work poorly on the visual perception tasks in VisOnlyQA, while human performance is nearly perfect. (ii) Fine-tuning on synthetic training data demonstrates the potential for enhancing the visual perception of LVLMs, but observed improvements are limited to certain tasks and specific models. (iii) Stronger language models improve the visual perception of LVLMs. In summary, our experiments suggest that both training data and model architectures should be improved to enhance the visual perception capabilities of LVLMs. The datasets, code, and model responses are provided at https://github. com/psunlpgroup/VisOnlyQA. 1.

In-context generation is a key component of large language models' (LLMs) open-task generalization capability. By leveraging a few examples as context, LLMs can perform both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Recent advancements in auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) built upon LLMs have showcased impressive performance in text-to-image generation. However, the potential of in-context learning for general image generation tasks remains largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce X-Prompt, a purely auto-regressive large-vision language model designed to deliver competitive performance across a wide range of both seen and unseen image generation tasks, all within a unified in-context learning framework. X-Prompt incorporates a specialized design that efficiently compresses valuable features from in-context examples, supporting longer in-context token sequences and improving its ability to generalize to unseen tasks. A unified training task for both text and image prediction enables X-Prompt to handle general image generation with enhanced task awareness from in-context examples. Extensive experiments validate the model's performance across diverse seen image generation tasks and its capacity to generalize to previously unseen tasks.

To address this, we introduce X-Prompt, a purely auto-regressive large-vision language model designed to deliver competitive performance across a wide range of both seen and unseen image generation tasks, all within a unified in-context learning framework. X-Prompt incorporates a specialized design that efficiently compresses valuable features from in-context examples, supporting longer in-context token sequences and improving its ability to generalize to unseen tasks. A unified training task for both text and image prediction enables X-Prompt to handle general image generation with enhanced task awareness from in-context examples. Extensive experiments validate the model's performance across diverse seen image generation tasks and its capacity to generalize to previously unseen tasks."

"In-context generation is a key component of large language models' (LLMs) open-task generalization capability. By leveraging a few examples as context, LLMs can perform both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

Diffusion models (DMs) excel in photorealism, image editing, and solving inverse problems, aided by classifier-free guidance and image inversion techniques. However, rectified flow models (RFMs) remain underexplored for these tasks. Existing DM-based methods often require additional training, lack generalization to pretrained latent models, underperform, and demand significant computational resources due to extensive backpropagation through ODE solvers and inversion processes. In this work, we first develop a theoretical and empirical understanding of the vector field dynamics of RFMs in efficiently guiding the denoising trajectory. Our findings reveal that we can navigate the vector field in a deterministic and gradient-free manner. Utilizing this property, we propose FlowChef, which leverages the vector field to steer the denoising trajectory for controlled image generation tasks, facilitated by gradient skipping. FlowChef is a unified framework for controlled image generation that, for the first time, simultaneously addresses classifier guidance, linear inverse problems, and image editing without the need for extra training, inversion, or intensive backpropagation. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations and show that FlowChef significantly outperforms baselines in terms of performance, memory, and time requirements, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

Errors in understanding visual information in images (i.e., visual perception errors) remain a major source of mistakes in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). While further analysis is essential, there is a deficiency in datasets for evaluating the visual perception of LVLMs. In this work, we introduce VisOnlyQA, a new dataset designed to directly evaluate the visual perception capabilities of LVLMs on questions about geometric and numerical information in scientific figures. Our dataset enables us to analyze the visual perception of LVLMs for fine-grained visual information, independent of other capabilities such as reasoning. The evaluation set of VisOnlyQA includes 1,200 multiple-choice questions in 12 tasks on four categories of figures. We also provide synthetic training data consisting of 70k instances. Our experiments on VisOnlyQA highlight the following findings: (i) 20 LVLMs we evaluate, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, work poorly on the visual perception tasks in VisOnlyQA, while human performance is nearly perfect. (ii) Fine-tuning on synthetic training data demonstrates the potential for enhancing the visual perception of LVLMs, but observed improvements are limited to certain tasks and specific models. (iii) Stronger language models improve the visual perception of LVLMs. In summary, our experiments suggest that both training data and model architectures should be improved to enhance the visual perception capabilities of LVLMs. The datasets, code, and model responses are provided at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/VisOnlyQA.
