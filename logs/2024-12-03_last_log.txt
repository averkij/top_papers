Key components of SAM 2 that drive the impressive video object segmentation performance include large multistage image encoder for frame feature extraction and memory mechanism that stores memory contexts from past frames to help current frame segmentation. The high computation complexity of multistage image encoder and memory module has limited its applications in real-world tasks, e.g., video object segmentation on mobile devices. To address this limitation, we propose EfficientTAMs, lightweight track anything models that produce high-quality results with low latency and model size. Our idea is based on revisiting the plain, nonhierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder for video object segmentation, and introducing an efficient memory module, which reduces the complexity for both frame feature extraction and memory computation for current frame segmentation. We take vanilla lightweight ViTs and efficient memory module to build EfficientTAMs, and train the models on SA-1B and SA-V datasets for video object segmentation and track anything tasks. We evaluate on multiple video segmentation benchmarks including semisupervised VOS and promptable video segmentation, and find that our proposed EfficientTAM with vanilla ViT perform comparably to SAM 2 model (HieraB+SAM 2) with 2x speedup on A100 and 2.4x parameter reduction. On segment anything image tasks, our EfficientTAMs also perform favorably over original SAM with 20x speedup on A100 and 20x parameter reduction. On mobile devices such as iPhone 15 "

Text:"A Simple and Provable Scaling Law for the Test-Time Compute of Large Language Models Yanxi Chen, Xuchen Pan, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding, Jingren Zhou Alibaba Group {chenyanxi.cyx, panxuchen.pxc, yaliang.li, bolin.ding, jingren.zhou}@alibaba-inc.com Abstract We propose general two-stage algorithm that enjoys provable scaling law for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs). Given an input problem, the proposed algorithm first generates candidate solutions, and then chooses the best one via multiple-round knockout tournament where each pair of candidates are compared for times and only the winners move on to the next round. In minimalistic implementation, both stages can be executed with black-box LLM alone and nothing else (e.g., no external verifier or reward model), and total of (K + 1) highly parallelizable LLM calls are needed for solving an input problem. For an input problem, assuming that generated candidate solution is correct with probability pgen > 0 and comparison between pair of correct and incorrect solutions identifies the right winner with probability pcomp > 0.5 (i.e., better than random guess), we prove theoretically that the failure probability of the proposed algorithm decays to zero exponentially with respect to and K: P(final output is incorrect) (1 pgen)N + log2 e2K(pcomp0.5) . Our empirical results with the challenging MMLU-Pro benchmark validate the technical assumptions, as well as the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and the gains from scaling up its test-time compute. 4 2 0 2 9 2 ] .

Diffusion Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image generation but often come with excessive parameterization, resulting in considerable inference overhead in real-world applications. In this work, we present TinyFusion, a depth pruning method designed to remove redundant layers from diffusion transformers via end-to-end learning. The core principle of our approach is to create a pruned model with high recoverability, allowing it to regain strong performance after fine-tuning. To accomplish this, we introduce a differentiable sampling technique to make pruning learnable, paired with a co-optimized parameter to simulate future fine-tuning. While prior works focus on minimizing loss or error after pruning, our method explicitly models and optimizes the post-fine-tuning performance of pruned models. Experimental results indicate that this learnable paradigm offers substantial benefits for layer pruning of diffusion transformers, surpassing existing importance-based and error-based methods. Additionally, TinyFusion exhibits strong generalization across diverse architectures, such as DiTs, MARs, and SiTs. Experiments with DiT-XL show that TinyFusion can craft a shallow diffusion transformer at less than 7% of the pre-training cost, achieving a 2times speedup with an FID score of 2.86, outperforming competitors with comparable efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/VainF/TinyFusion.

"Diffusion Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image generation but often come with excessive parameterization, resulting in considerable inference overhead in real-world applications. In this work, we present TinyFusion, a depth pruning method designed to remove redundant layers from diffusion transformers via end-to-end learning. The core principle of our approach is to create a pruned model with high recoverability, allowing it to regain strong performance after fine-tuning. To accomplish this, we introduce a differentiable sampling technique to make pruning learnable, paired with a co-optimized parameter to simulate future fine-tuning. While prior works focus on minimizing loss or error after pruning, our method explicitly models and optimizes the post-fine-tuning performance of pruned models. Experimental results indicate that this learnable paradigm offers substantial benefits for layer pruning of diffusion transformers, surpassing existing importance-based and error-based methods. Additionally, TinyFusion exhibits strong generalization across diverse architectures, such as DiTs, MARs, and SiTs. Experiments with DiT-XL show that TinyFusion can craft a shallow diffusion transformer at less than 7% of the pre-training cost, achieving a 2times speedup with an FID score of 2.86, outperforming competitors with comparable efficiency.

Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has emerged as a powerful tool for video object segmentation and tracking anything. Key components of SAM 2 that drive the impressive video object segmentation performance include a large multistage image encoder for frame feature extraction and a memory mechanism that stores memory contexts from past frames to help current frame segmentation. The high computation complexity of multistage image encoder and memory module has limited its applications in real-world tasks, e.g., video object segmentation on mobile devices. To address this limitation, we propose EfficientTAMs, lightweight track anything models that produce high-quality results with low latency and model size. Our idea is based on revisiting the plain, nonhierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder for video object segmentation, and introducing an efficient memory module, which reduces the complexity for both frame feature extraction and memory computation for current frame segmentation. We take vanilla lightweight ViTs and efficient memory module to build EfficientTAMs, and train the models on SA-1B and SA-V datasets for video object segmentation and track anything tasks. We evaluate on multiple video segmentation benchmarks including semi-supervised VOS and promptable video segmentation, and find that our proposed EfficientTAM with vanilla ViT perform comparably to SAM 2 model (HieraB+SAM 2) with ~2x speedup on A100 and ~2.4x parameter reduction. On segment anything image tasks, our EfficientTAMs also perform favorably over original SAM with ~20x speedup on A100 and ~20x parameter reduction. On mobile devices such as iPhone 15 Pro Max, our EfficientTAMs can run at ~10 FPS for performing video object segmentation with reasonable quality, highlighting the capability of small models for on-device video object segmentation applications.

With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. We shift the generative modeling from the pixel-based latent space to a learned motion latent space, enabling efficient design of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with a simple yet effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.

We propose a general two-stage algorithm that enjoys a provable scaling law for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs).

Current large multimodal models (LMMs) face significant challenges in processing and comprehending long-duration or high-resolution videos, which is mainly due to the lack of high-quality datasets. To address this issue from a data-centric perspective, we propose VISTA, a simple yet effective Video Spatiotemporal Augmentation framework that synthesizes long-duration and high-resolution video instruction-following pairs from existing video-caption datasets. VISTA spatially and temporally combines videos to create new synthetic videos with extended durations and enhanced resolutions, and subsequently produces question-answer pairs pertaining to these newly synthesized videos. Based on this paradigm, we develop seven video augmentation methods and curate VISTA-400K, a video instruction-following dataset aimed at enhancing long-duration and high-resolution video understanding. Finetuning various video LMMs on our data resulted in an average improvement of 3.3% across four challenging benchmarks for long-video understanding. Furthermore, we introduce the first comprehensive high-resolution video understanding benchmark HRVideoBench, on which our finetuned models achieve a 6.5% performance gain. These results highlight the effectiveness of our framework.
