The human user (bottom left) provides request (Find the picture) in natural language. The agent has to locate the object within completely unknown environment, interacting with the user only when needed via template-free, open-ended natural-language dialogue. Our method, Agent-user Interaction with UncerTainty Awareness (AIUTA), addresses this challenging task, minimizing user interactions by equipping the agent with two modules: Self-Questioner and an Interaction Trigger, whose output is shown in the blue boxes along the agents path (① to ⑤), and whose inner working is shown on the right. The Self-Questioner leverages Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Model (VLM) in self-dialogue to initially describe the agents observation, and then extract additional relevant details, with novel entropy-based technique to reduce hallucinations and inaccuracies, producing refined detection description. The Interaction Trigger uses this refined description to decide whether to pose question to the user (①,③,④), continue the navigation (②) or halt the exploration (⑤). "

Existing embodied instance goal navigation tasks, driven by natural language, assume human users to provide complete and nuanced instance descriptions prior to the navigation, which can be impractical in the real world as human instructions might be brief and ambiguous. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task, Collaborative Instance Navigation (CoIN), with dynamic agent-human interaction during navigation to actively resolve uncertainties about the target instance in natural, template-free, open-ended dialogues. To address CoIN, we propose a novel method, Agent-user Interaction with UncerTainty Awareness (AIUTA), leveraging the perception capability of Vision Language Models (VLMs) and the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, upon object detection, a Self-Questioner model initiates a self-dialogue to obtain a complete and accurate observation description, while a novel uncertainty estimation technique mitigates inaccurate VLM perception. Then, an Interaction Trigger module determines whether to ask a question to the user, continue or halt navigation, minimizing user input. For evaluation, we introduce CoIN-Bench, a benchmark supporting both real and simulated humans. AIUTA achieves competitive performance in instance navigation against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating great flexibility in handling user inputs.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in visual understanding and generation tasks. However, generating interleaved image-text content remains a challenge, which requires integrated multimodal understanding and generation abilities. While the progress in unified models offers new solutions, existing benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating these methods due to data size and diversity limitations. To bridge this gap, we introduce GATE OpenING (OpenING), a comprehensive benchmark comprising 5,400 high-quality human-annotated instances across 56 real-world tasks. OpenING covers diverse daily scenarios such as travel guide, design, and brainstorming, offering a robust platform for challenging interleaved generation methods. In addition, we present IntJudge, a judge model for evaluating open-ended multimodal generation methods. Trained with a novel data pipeline, our IntJudge achieves an agreement rate of 82. 42% with human judgments, outperforming GPT-based evaluators by 11.34%. Extensive experiments on OpenING reveal that current interleaved generation methods still have substantial room for improvement. Key findings on interleaved image-text generation are further presented to guide the development of next-generation models. The OpenING is open-sourced at https://opening.github.io.
