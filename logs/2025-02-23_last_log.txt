[23.02.2025 12:38] Abstract 0. We introduce Meta MLGym and MLGym-Bench, a new framework and benchmark for evaluating and developing LLM agents on AI research tasks. This is the first Gym environment for machine learning (ML) tasks, enabling research on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for training such agents. MLGym-bench c...

[23.02.2025 12:38] Abstract 1. We introduce SigLIP 2, a family of new multilingual vision-language encoders that build on the success of the original SigLIP.

[23.02.2025 12:38] Abstract 2. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in mainstream academic disciplines such as mathematics, physics, and computer science. However, human knowledge encompasses over 200 specialized disciplines, far exceeding the scope of existing benchmarks. The capabilities of LLMs...

[23.02.2025 12:38] Abstract 3. The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on many tasks is greatly limited by the knowledge learned during pre-training and stored in the model's parameters. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a popular and efficient training technique for updating or domain-specific adaptation of LLMs. In this stu...

[23.02.2025 12:38] Abstract 4. Increasing test-time compute for LLMs shows promise across domains but remains underexplored in code generation, despite extensive study in math. In this paper, we propose S*, the first hybrid test-time scaling framework that substantially improves the coverage and selection accuracy of generated co...

[23.02.2025 12:38] Abstract 5. Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1, we explore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) in large reasoning models. To analyze reasoning dynamics, we use synthetic logic puzzles as training data due to their controllable complexity and straightforward answer verification. We make s...

[23.02.2025 12:38] Abstract 6. The realization of scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing is expected to hinge on quantum error-correcting codes. In the quest for more efficient quantum fault tolerance, a critical code parameter is the weight of measurements that extract information about errors to enable error correction: as h...

[23.02.2025 12:38] Abstract 7. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of LLM test-time scaling. However, existing approaches to incentivize LLMs' deep thinking abilities generally require large-scale data or significant training efforts. Meanwhile, it remains unclear how to improve the thinking abilities of less power...

[23.02.2025 12:38] Abstract 8. Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can process inputs with context lengths up to 128k visual and text tokens, yet they struggle to generate coherent outputs beyond 1,000 words. We find that the primary limitation is the absence of long output examples during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). ...

[23.02.2025 12:38] Abstract 9. While the ability of language models to elicit facts has been widely investigated, how they handle temporally changing facts remains underexplored. We discover Temporal Heads, specific attention heads primarily responsible for processing temporal knowledge through circuit analysis. We confirm that t...

In the field of MLLM-based GUI agents, compared to smartphones, the PC scenario not only features a more complex interactive environment, but also involves more intricate intra- and inter-app workflows. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical agent framework named PC-Agent. Specifically, ...

[23.02.2025 12:38] Abstract 12. Reasoning about images with rich text, such as charts and documents, is a critical application of vision-language models (VLMs). However, VLMs often struggle in these domains due to the scarcity of diverse text-rich vision-language data. To address this challenge, we present CoSyn, a framework that ...

We introduce Meta MLGym and MLGym-Bench, a new framework and benchmark for evaluating and developing LLM agents on AI research tasks. This is the first Gym environment for machine learning (ML) tasks, enabling research on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for training such agents. MLGym-bench consists of 13 diverse and open-ended AI research tasks from diverse domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and game theory. Solving these tasks requires real-world AI research skills such as generating new ideas and hypotheses, creating and processing data, implementing ML methods, training models, running experiments, analyzing the results, and iterating through this process to improve on a given task. We evaluate a number of frontier large language models (LLMs) on our benchmarks such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1 405B, GPT-4o, o1-preview, and Gemini-1.5 Pro. Our MLGym framework makes it easy to add new tasks, integrate and evaluate models or agents, generate synthetic data at scale, as well as develop new learning algorithms for training agents on AI research tasks. We find that current frontier models can improve on the given baselines, usually by finding better hyperparameters, but do not generate novel hypotheses, algorithms, architectures, or substantial improvements. We open-source our framework and benchmark to facilitate future research in advancing the AI research capabilities of LLM agents.

我们介绍了Meta MLGym和MLGym-Bench，这是一个用于评估和开发LLM代理在AI研究任务上的新框架和基准。这是第一个用于机器学习任务的Gym环境，支持强化学习算法的研究。MLGym-Bench包含13个多样化和开放式的AI研究任务，涵盖计算机视觉、自然语言处理、强化学习和博弈论等领域。解决这些任务需要实际的AI研究技能，如生成新想法和假设、创建和处理数据、实现ML方法、训练模型、运行实验、分析结果并迭代改进。我们评估了多个前沿大语言模型，如Claude-3.5-Sonnet和GPT-4o。我们的框架便于添加新任务、集成和评估模型或代理、大规模生成合成数据以及开发新的学习算法。我们发现当前的前沿模型可以通过找到更好的超参数来改进基线，但不会生成新的假设、算法、架构或显著改进。我们开源了我们的框架和基准，以促进未来在提高LLM代理的AI研究能力方面的研究。
