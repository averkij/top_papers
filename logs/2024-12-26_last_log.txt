With Mulberry260k, we perform collective SFT to train our model, Mulberry, series of MLLMs with o1like step-by-step Reasoning and Reflection capabilities.

Introduction What cannot create, do not understand. Richard Feynman Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) embody the essence of this dictum, which understand the world by learning to create expected responses to multimodal inputs such as images and text. While MLLMs have recently shown sigEqual Contribution. Correspondence to: Jiaxing Huang <jiaxing.huang@ntu.edu.sg>. 1 Nanyang Technological University; 2 Tsinghua University; 3 Baidu Inc.; 4 Sun Yat-sen University. 1 Figure 1: (a) Our CoMCTS shows great superiority in search effectiveness and efficiency against other tree search methods. (b) Our Mulberry, trained on CoMCTS-searched data, outperforms most open-sourced MLLMs and achieves competitive results against closed-source ones, showing outstanding abilities in step-by-step reasoning and reflection. nificant progress in straightforward tasks (Liu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b), they often experience obviously increased failures on complex tasks requiring in-depth reasoning (Zhang et al., 2024d). Feynmans dictum might be the perfect metaphor of such failures of MLLMs, as we should only be able to work something out if we can create and have firm understanding of each step of the reasoning involved. However, current MLLMs predominantly operate in simple direct prediction mode (Xu et al., 2024), i.e., generating brief, final answers to questions with little explicit and well-defined intermediate reasoning steps. In this work, we aim to develop an MLLM that understands and solves questions by learning to create each intermediate step of the reasoning involved till the final answer. Recent advances in NLP, such as OpenAI o1 (OpenAI, 2024), have Mulberry: Empowering MLLM with o1-like Reasoning and Reflection via Collective Monte Carlo Tree Search shown great potential in enabling LLM to learn to reason and tackle complex language tasks (Xie et al., 2024). The core design of these advances lies in AlphaGo-like tree search: they employ tree search methods, like MCTS (Coulom, 2006), to bootstrap an LLM itself to build tree of intermediate thoughts, explore effective reasoning paths, and leverage these paths to teach the model to reason step-bystep. space of single MLLM itself. (2) The joint simulation and error positioning mechanism enables CoMCTS to, in each search iteration, skip multiple intermediate steps and select the last correct step as the next start node, largely reducing search time while maintaining search effectiveness. Here, collective knowledge is also crucial as it is often challenging for model to recognize and position errors made by itself while relatively easy by using other models. An intuitive idea is to directly apply these tree search methods to search effective reasoning paths for MLLMs, which, however, does not work well. As illustrated in Figure 1, we believe this is largely attributed to several observed search challenges for MLLMs. (1) Search Effectiveness: Traditional MCTS methods generally work by self-bootstrapping while current MLLMs are typically trained with little explicit and well-defined intermediate reasoning steps, making these search methods often trapped in homogeneous lowquality nodes within the reasoning space of single MLLM, ultimately leading to low search success rates. (2) Search Efficiency: Traditional MCTS methods typically expand and explore only one subsequent reasoning node per search iteration, which advance single step each time and demand massive iterations, making them inefficient for computationintensive MLLMs. To tackle these challenges, we propose Collective Monte Carlo Tree Search (CoMCTS), new learning-to-reason method for MLLMs, which introduces the concept of collective learning into tree search for effective and efficient reasoning-path searching and learning. The core idea of CoMCTS is to leverage collective knowledge to collaboratively conjecture, search and identify effective reasoning paths toward correct answers. Specifically, CoMCTS searches effective reasoning paths iteratively, and in each iteration, it leverages collective knowledge from multiple MLLMs to jointly (a) expand diverse and complementary candidate subsequent reasoning nodes till the end from given start node, (b) simulate reasoning outcomes, position error candidate nodes and prune them along with their child nodes, (c) backpropagate to update the score and visit count of each reasoning node in bottom-up manner, and (d) select the leaf reasoning node with the highest Upper Confidence Bound value as next start node. In this way, our CoMCTS achieves effective and efficient reasoning search. (1) The joint expansion mechanism enables CoMCTS to concatenate reasoning trajectories from multiple MLLMs via iterative search, ultimately constructing an unified reasoning tree comprising diverse and complementary reasoning nodes. Thus, it allows reasoning-path search not only within the reasoning space of given MLLM itself but also among those of others, benefiting from the synergy of multiple MLLMs while avoiding being trapped in homogeneous l"

We present an efficient encoder-free approach for video-language understanding that achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. Current video-language models typically rely on heavyweight image encoders (300M-1.1B parameters) or video encoders (1B-1.4B parameters), creating a substantial computational burden when processing multi-frame videos. Our method introduces a novel Spatio-Temporal Alignment Block (STAB) that directly processes video inputs without requiring pre-trained encoders while using only 45M parameters for visual processing - at least a 6.5times reduction compared to traditional approaches. The STAB architecture combines Local Spatio-Temporal Encoding for fine-grained feature extraction, efficient spatial downsampling through learned attention and separate mechanisms for modeling frame-level and video-level relationships. Our model achieves comparable or superior performance to encoder-based approaches for open-ended video question answering on standard benchmarks. The fine-grained video question-answering evaluation demonstrates our model's effectiveness, outperforming the encoder-based approaches Video-ChatGPT and Video-LLaVA in key aspects like correctness and temporal understanding. Extensive ablation studies validate our architectural choices and demonstrate the effectiveness of our spatio-temporal modeling approach while achieving 3-4times faster processing speeds than previous methods.

"In this work, we aim to develop an MLLM that understands and solves questions by learning to create each intermediate step of the reasoning involved till the final answer. To this end, we propose Collective Monte Carlo Tree Search (CoMCTS), a new learning-to-reason method for MLLMs, which introduces the concept of collective learning into ``tree search'' for effective and efficient reasoning-path searching and learning. The core idea of CoMCTS is to leverage collective knowledge from multiple models to collaboratively conjecture, search and identify effective reasoning paths toward correct answers via four iterative operations including Expansion, Simulation and Error Positioning, Backpropagation, and Selection. Using CoMCTS, we construct Mulberry-260k, a multimodal dataset with a tree of rich, explicit and well-defined reasoning nodes for each question. With Mulberry-260k, we perform collective SFT to train our model, Mulberry, a series of MLLMs with o1-like step-by-step Reasoning and Reflection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods on various benchmarks. Code will be available at https://github.com/HJYao00/Mulberry"
