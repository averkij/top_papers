While our framework is generally applicable, we showcase the efficacy of WavePulse in collaborative project with team of political scientists focusing on the 2024 Presidential Election. We use WavePulse to monitor livestreams of 396 news radio stations over period of three months, processing close to 500,000 hours of audio streams. These streams were converted into time-stamped, diarized transcripts and analyzed to answer key political science questions at both the national and state levels.
