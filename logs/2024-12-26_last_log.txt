[26.12.2024 04:13] Claude request. Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620. Prompt: Read an abstract of the ML paper and return a JSON with fields: 'desc': explanation of the paper in Russian (4 sentences), use correct machine learning terms. 'emoji': emoji that will reflect the theme of an article somehow, only one emoji. 'title': a slogan of a main idea of the article in Russian. Return only JSON and nothing else.

Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework, which dynamically estimates token budgets for different problems based on reasoning complexity and uses the estimated token budgets to guide the reasoning process. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

  "desc": "Статья описывает новый подход к рассуждениям в больших языковых моделях (LLM), направленный на оптимизацию использования токенов. Авторы предлагают метод, который динамически оценивает бюджет токенов для различных задач на основе сложности рассуждений. Этот подход позволяет значительно сократить расходы на токены при использовании метода цепочки мыслей (CoT), сохраняя при этом высокую точность. Эксперименты показывают эффективность предложенного метода в балансировании эффективности и точности рассуждений LLM.",
