Text:"5 2 0 2 6 2 ] . [ 1 7 6 0 2 2 . 9 0 5 2 : r arXiv preprint, under review THE ROGUE SCALPEL:Anton Korznikov, Andrey Galichin, Alexey Dontsov, Oleg Y. Rogov, Ivan Oseledets, Elena TutubalinaActivation steering is promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into models hidden states during inference. It is often framed as precise, interpretable, and potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite: steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model families, we show that even steering in random direction can increase the probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 227%. Alarmingly, steering benign features from sparse autoencoder (SAE), common source of interpretable directions, increases these rates by further 2-4%. Finally, we show that combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak single prompt creates universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not guarantee precise control over model behavior. This paper contains examples of harmful language, and reader discretion is recommended.Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation, demonstrating capabilities in text summarization (Zhang et al., 2025), question answering (Wei et al., 2024), coding (Chen et al., 2021), and complex reasoning (Guo et al., 2025; Lightman et al., 2023). Effectively leveraging these capabilities for diverse applications requires reliable methods to control and adjust model behavior. Traditional approaches include fine-tuning (Hu et al., 2022) and prompt engineering (Schulhoff et al., 2024). However, both methods remain fundamentally non-interpretable: it is difficult to predict how fine-tuned model will generalize (Chu et al., 2025) or why particular prompt succeeds (Seleznyov et al., 2025; Errica et al., 2024). This limitation has driven the field of mechanistic interpretability, which seeks to reverse-engineer neural networks into human-understandable components and then use them for precise model control (Bereska & Gavves, 2024; Sharkey et al., 2025). prominent example of this new paradigm is activation steering, technique rooted in the observation that human-interpretable concepts, such as truthfulness (Marks & Tegmark, 2023), refusal (Arditi et al., 2022), and sentiment (Tigges et al., 2023; Konen et al., 2024), are often represented as linear directions in latent space. The technique operates by injecting carefully chosen direction vector into the hidden states of the model in specified layer for all tokens during inference, thereby moving its activations along chosen direction to enhance the corresponding behavior (Stolfo et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2023a). These steering vectors are commonly sourced from interpretable features of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) (Bricken et al., 2023) or via methods such as difference-in-means (Marks & Tegmark, 2023). However, the interpretability of these methods may create false sense of security. Can precise steering truly guarantee safe and predictable outcomes? Prior work has shown that narrow finetuning on insecure code or even on benign data can significantly degrade alignment and weaken safety guardrails (Qi et al., 2023; Betley et al., 2025; Hahm et al., 2025). By contrast, the safety implications of activation steering remain underexplored. Existing studies focus mainly on adversarial jailbreak vectors (Wang & Shu, 2023; Chia et al., 2025; Dunefsky, 2025; Xu et al., 2024), leaving Correspondence to korznikovantona@gmail.com 1 arXiv preprint, under review Figure 1: Side effects of activation steering. The left panel demonstrates the models default behavior, showing appropriate and safe responses to both neutral and harmful prompts. The right panel shows the effect of injecting single steering vector (enhancing benign France concept). This intervention not only introduces thematic bias in neutral contexts but also critically bypasses safety safeguards, compelling the model to comply with harmful requests it would normally refuse. open the critical question of whether benign steering might also undermine alignment. We therefore hypothesize that activation steering, like scalpel, can enable precise behavioral control but also carries the risk of systematically compromising models safety mechanisms (see Fig. 1). In this work, we investigate the safety vulnerabilities of activation steering by measuring how it affects refusal mechanisms. Using the JailbreakBench dataset (Chao et al., 2024) containing 100 harmful queries from 10 categories, we applied steering, collected responses, and evaluated their harmfulness using an LLM-as-judge approach (Gu et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2023). This methodology reveals systematic failure mode that is consistent across multiple model families, including Llama-3 (Dubey et al., 2024), Qwen2.5 (Qwen et al., 2025), and Falcon-3 (Team, 2024) at various scales. Here are our key findings: 1. Steering in random direction can effectively break the models refusal mechanisms. Merely adding random noise to activations during inference increases the rate of harmful compliance from 0% to between 2-27%, depending on the model and prompt. We further found that steering is most effective when applied to the models middle layers, with the optimal steering coefficient varying significantly across both models and layers. 2. Steering with SAE features is even more harmful, increasing the probability of compliance by 2-4% over random steering. This is noteworthy, given that SAE features represent standard source of steering vectors for interpretable model control. Furthermore, the most effective jailbreaking features correspond to benign concepts and show poor generalization across prompts, making systematic safety monitoring practically infeasible. 3. We can create universal attack that generalizes to unseen harmful prompts, by aggregating just 20 random vectors that jailbreak only one prompt. Crucially, this attack requires no harmful training data, model weights, gradients, or output logits. This finding reveals that the capabilities of activation steering can be easily weaponized by malicious actors to bypass safeguards for wide range of harmfu"

Text:"IoT-MCP: Bridging LLMs and IoT Systems Through Model Context Protocol Ningyuan Yang, Guanliang Lyu, Mingchen Ma, Yiyi Lu, Yiming Li, Zhihui Gao, Hancheng Ye, Jianyi Zhang, Tingjun Chen, Yiran Chen Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University 5 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 0 6 2 1 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r Abstract The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems faces significant challenges in hardware heterogeneity and control complexity. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerges as critical enabler, providing standardized communication between LLMs and physical devices. We propose IoT-MCP, novel framework that implements MCP through edge-deployed servers to bridge LLMs and IoT ecosystems. To support rigorous evaluation, we introduce IoT-MCP Bench, the first benchmark containing 114 Basic Tasks (e.g., What is the current temperature?) and 1,140 Complex Tasks (e.g., feel so hot, do you have any ideas?) for IoT-enabled LLMs. Experimental validation across 22 sensor types and 6 microcontroller units demonstrates IoTMCPs 100% task success rate to generate tool calls that fully meet expectations and obtain completely accurate results, 205ms average response time, and 74KB peak memory footprint. This work delivers both an open-source integration framework (https://github.com/Duke-CEI-Center/IoTMCP-Servers) and standardized evaluation methodology for LLM-IoT systems.

Activation steering, intended to control LLM behavior, can instead increase harmful compliance and undermine model alignment safeguards.  					AI-generated summary 				 Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite: steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not guarantee precise control over model behavior.

IoT-MCP, a framework using the Model Context Protocol, enables seamless communication between Large Language Models and IoT devices, achieving high task success rates and low resource usage.  					AI-generated summary 				 The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems faces significant challenges in hardware heterogeneity and control complexity. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerges as a critical enabler, providing standardized communication between LLMs and physical devices. We propose IoT-MCP, a novel framework that implements MCP through edge-deployed servers to bridge LLMs and IoT ecosystems. To support rigorous evaluation, we introduce IoT-MCP Bench, the first benchmark containing 114 Basic Tasks (e.g., ``What is the current temperature?'') and 1,140 Complex Tasks (e.g., ``I feel so hot, do you have any ideas?'') for IoT-enabled LLMs. Experimental validation across 22 sensor types and 6 microcontroller units demonstrates IoT-MCP's 100% task success rate to generate tool calls that fully meet expectations and obtain completely accurate results, 205ms average response time, and 74KB peak memory footprint. This work delivers both an open-source integration framework (https://github.com/Duke-CEI-Center/IoT-MCP-Servers) and a standardized evaluation methodology for LLM-IoT systems.

"IoT-MCP, a framework using the Model Context Protocol, enables seamless communication between Large Language Models and IoT devices, achieving high task success rates and low resource usage.  					AI-generated summary 				 The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems faces significant challenges in hardware heterogeneity and control complexity. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerges as a critical enabler, providing standardized communication between LLMs and physical devices. We propose IoT-MCP, a novel framework that implements MCP through edge-deployed servers to bridge LLMs and IoT ecosystems. To support rigorous evaluation, we introduce IoT-MCP Bench, the first benchmark containing 114 Basic Tasks (e.g., ``What is the current temperature?'') and 1,140 Complex Tasks (e.g., ``I feel so hot, do you have any ideas?'') for IoT-enabled LLMs. Experimental validation across 22 sensor types and 6 microcontroller units demonstrates IoT-MCP's 100% task success rate to generate tool calls that fully meet expectations and obtain completely accurate results, 205ms average response time, and 74KB peak memory footprint. This work delivers both an open-source integration framework (https://github.com/Duke-CEI-Center/IoT-MCP-Servers) and a standardized evaluation methodology for LLM-IoT systems."
