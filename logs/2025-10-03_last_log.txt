Text:"5 2 0 2 1 ] . [ 1 6 4 3 1 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r Aristotle: IMO-level Automated Theorem ProvingWe introduce Aristotle, an AI system that combines formal verification with informal reasoning, achieving gold-medal-equivalent performance on the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad problems. Aristotle integrates three main components: Lean proof search system, an informal reasoning system that generates and formalizes lemmas, and dedicated geometry solver. Our system demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with favorable scaling properties for automated theorem proving.Among the ways in which machine learning can accelerate scientific research, formal mathematical reasoning stands out as central objective. Mathematical reasoning is foundational to most empirical sciences, is significant bottleneck in many theoretical sciences, and is particularly well-suited for reinforcement learning. Most importantly, the task of mathematical reasoning has the potential to unlock much broader set of reasoning abilities. This paper introduces our system, Aristotle, and describes the architecture that enabled it to achieve gold-medal-equivalent performance on the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) by providing correct formal solutions to five out of the six problems [15]. We distinguish formal mathematical reasoning, by which we mean proof written in machine-verifiable language like Lean 4, from the informal, or natural language, reasoning that human might write. Requiring model to verify its reasoning in Lean 4 provides reliable and fast reward signal across many domains of mathematics. In addition, automating the arduous manual task of formalizing mathematical arguments would make formal verification viable as general tool for mathematicians, which could have significant impact on mathematical research [41]. For these reasons, automated theorem proving has become very active area of machine learning research. Aristotle is designed to combine the strengths of formal verification with those of informal reasoning, which lets Aristotle flexibly plan and reason, in addition to leveraging the much larger corpus of mathematical proofs available in natural rather than formal language. While Aristotle may use informal reasoning and code execution to find answers and draft proofs, we only consider problem to be solved if our system produces complete proof using the Lean 4 proof language and its mathematical library Mathlib, without gaps or unsound axioms like sorryAx. We handle geometry problems separately, but still require machineverified solutions. Please send correspondence to aristotle-report@harmonic.fun. 1 Aristotle consists of three major subsystems: 1. Lean proof search algorithm which ingests Lean proof sketch and attempts to prove all unproved goals in the sketch. The search algorithm is highly parallel Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) using large transformer as its policy and value function. The policy predicts Lean tactics conditional on the Lean proof state, proof history, and, if available, an informal proof. 2. lemma-based informal reasoning system which generates informal proofs of mathematical statements, breaks these proofs down into lemmas, formalizes each lemma into Lean, and iterates this process based on formal feedback. 3. geometry solver which solves plane geometry problems outside of Lean using an approach based on AlphaGeometry [45]. The version of Aristotle that was evaluated on the IMO underwent fine tuning for contest mathematics, but it was also trained broadly on many forms of formal mathematics. During training, it made novel contributions to Mathlib as well as several other open source repositories, caught subtle mistakes in popular textbook, and showed proficiency in more advanced topics such as category theory and homological algebra; see Secion 3. This shows that Aristotle is capable of much broader range of mathematical reasoning than that demonstrated by contest problems. In the rest of this report we describe in more detail our main contributions: Developing system, Aristotle, that reaches state-of-the-art automated theorem proving performance. Achieving gold-medal performance on the IMO 2025 problems. Demonstrating favorable scaling for automated theorem proving systems based on Monte Carlo search over possible proof steps. There are several benchmarks for automated theorem proving for contest problems at the high school and university level [4, 46, 57, 59]. The state-of-the-art has been steadily improving on these benchmarks, with models taking various approaches, including whole-proof approaches [34, 49, 60], step-wise approaches [36, 55], and hybrid systems that combine informal reasoning, formal reasoning, and iterative refinement/correction. In addition, autoformalization/data pipelines have helped bridge informal problem statements to formal inputs [24]. Nevertheless, gold-level IMO performance has remained out of reach until this year. ByteDance has also announced system, Seed-Prover [5], that achieved gold-medal IMO 2025 score with formal solutions, and OpenAI and Google Deepmind have announced gold-medal level performance with natural language solutions. We discuss these and other related systems in more detail in Section 4. Prior to this, the state-of-the-art for solving IMO-level math problems was AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry-2 [6, 12], which achieved silver-medal-level formal solutions on the IMO 2024 problems. Our formal solutions to five of the six IMO 2025 problems are available on GitHub [14]. As of September 2025, you can register for early access to Aristotle at our website.In this section we describe in more detail the different systems that comprise Aristotle."
