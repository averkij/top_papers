Text:"StealthAttack: Robust 3D Gaussian Splatting Poisoning via Density-Guided Illusions Bo-Hsu Ke You-Zhe Xie Yu-Lun Liu Wei-Chen Chiu5 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 4 1 3 2 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r a3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and propose novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose KDE-based evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate our methods superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Project page: https://hentci.github.io/stealthattack/ 1. Introduction 3D scene representation methods, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)[72] and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)[42], have significantly advanced novel view synthesis, accurately modeling complex scene geometry and appearance. Along with their popularity, the protection of 3D digital content encoded in these representations has become matter of concern, where we have witnessed the corresponding watermarking or steganography techniques being proposed in recent years. For instance, GaussianMarker [35] and 3DGSW [38] embed watermarks (mainly binary messages) into Gaussian parameters of 3DGS with minimal visual impact, coupled with dedicated decoders to decipher the hidden messages. Moreover, embedding or hiding extraneous information/messages into 3D scene representations is also directly connected to the risk of data poisoning (where the extraneous information as the poison appears in the training data Figure 1. Illustration of our proposed Density-Guided Poisoning Attack for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method strategically distribute the Gaussian points of the illusory object (i.e. the red vehicle) among the low-density regions which are discovered along the rays casted from the virtual camera of the poisoned view (i.e. the target view that we would like to attack), making the illusory object clearly visible from the poisoned view while having the minimal interference for the rendering quality on the other non-target/innocent views. and is encoded into the 3D representations during model training), in which the further utilization or visualization of the poisoned 3D representations would lead to abnormal or even malicious model behaviours (i.e. the negative impact stemmed from the poison is triggered). To this end, in this work, we focus on the investigation of poisoning attacks on 3D scene representation methods, as they become integral to safety-critical applications. Hence, addressing their security vulnerabilities is not only of utmost importance but also urgent. While there exists prior work of studying the poisoning attack upon NeRF, i.e. IPA-NeRF [40] which effectively exploits NeRFs implicit representations to embed targeted visual illusions (i.e. the illusion as poison will appear while rendering the scene from certain viewing direction), its applicability to explicit 3D scene representations (particularly 3DGS) however remains limited and not directly transferable. Considering the rapidly growing application scenarios 1 of 3DGS (thanks to its capability of fast rendering and accurately capturing scene geometry), we devote our research effort to realizing poisoning attacks on 3D Gaussian splatting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of its kind. While concurrent work, Poison-Splat [63] focuses on computational cost attacks, our work targets visible illusion embedding. In particular, we would like to inject the visible illusory objects (i.e., poison) onto target view (named as poisoned view) while keeping the other non-target views (named as innocent views) unaffected, as shown in Figure 1. Our work starts from conducting an investigation (cf. Figure 2) upon the robustness of 3DGS against the prior image-level poisoning methods such as IPA-NeRF, where we find that the attempts of directly adopting IPA-NeRFs approach or naively injecting illusory content into training images easily fail, as 3DGSs inherent multi-view consistency and densification processes effectively neutralize or significantly weaken these attacks. Motivated by the aforementioned investigation, we propose density-guided poisoning method for 3DGS. Our approach (cf. Figure 1) strategically identifies low-density regions in the initial Gaussian point cloud using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), in which the points of illusory objects are then distributed among the low-density regions along the rays casting from the virtual camera of target view (i.e. the rays are casted from the virtual camera with the target viewing direction). These points effectively embed illusory objects which would be clearly visible from targeted views, while having minimal impact on other innocent views (i.e, being less perceptible). Moreover, we introduce the adaptive Gaussian noise into innocent views during training for disrupting the property of multi-view consistency in 3DGS, in order to further enhance the overall efficacy of the attack. We conduct extensive experiments, and the results demonstrate the consistent superiority of our proposed poisoning method in comparison to several baselines. The contribution of our work can be summarized as follows: We are the first work to address data poisoning attacks upon 3D Gaussian Splatting for illusory objects injection. We identify and analyze the robustness of 3DGS against the prior poisoning attack techniques. We propose density-guided poisoning method tailored for 3DGS, introducing adaptive noise scheduling to disrupt the multi-view consistency of 3DGS and better realize the entire attack. 2.

In practice, forecasters face thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon, where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. general, domain-agnostic framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by leveraging multi-modal diagnostics (Zhang et al., 2024) and self-planning over the input; Forecaster performs model fitting and validation and based on the results to adaptively select the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into comprehensive, transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks.

A novel density-guided poisoning method for 3D Gaussian Splatting enhances attack effectiveness by strategically injecting Gaussian points and disrupting multi-view consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Project page: https://hentci.github.io/stealthattack/

"A novel density-guided poisoning method for 3D Gaussian Splatting enhances attack effectiveness by strategically injecting Gaussian points and disrupting multi-view consistency.  					AI-generated summary 				 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Project page: https://hentci.github.io/stealthattack/"

RewardMap, a multi-stage reinforcement learning framework, enhances multimodal large language models' visual understanding and reasoning skills through dense reward signals and a difficulty-aware reward design.  					AI-generated summary 				 Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover, models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.

A theoretical framework and algorithms for improving multi-subject fidelity in text-to-image models through control over sampling dynamics.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art multi-subject fidelity across models.

TimeSeriesScientist (TSci) is an LLM-driven framework that automates time series forecasting with minimal human intervention, outperforming statistical and LLM-based methods and providing transparent reports.  					AI-generated summary 				 Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon, where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive, transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks. Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more transparent and interpretable.

Research on large language models reveals an asymmetric spectral scaling law in feed-forward networks, indicating that increasing width primarily adds low-energy directions while dominant modes saturate early, leading to underutilized latent space.  					AI-generated summary 				 As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA, GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.
