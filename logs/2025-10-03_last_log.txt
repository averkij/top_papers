Text:"RLAD: Training LLMs to Discover Abstractions for Solving Reasoning Problems Yuxiao Qu*1, Anikait Singh*2, Yoonho Lee*2, Amrith Setlur1, Ruslan Salakhutdinov1, Chelsea Finn2, Aviral Kumar1 1Carnegie Mellon University, 2Stanford University, *Equal contribution 5 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 3 6 2 2 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r Figure 1: Reasoning abstractions illustrated in the solution-space graph for problem. We depict the solution space as graph of intermediate steps leading to correct or incorrect answers. (1) Standard reasoning explores this space along one sequential chain. (2) We generate textual abstractions by summarizing which intermediate steps led to which outcomes. (3) Such abstractions can be reused to guide reasoning more efficiently. Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions to identify and implement algorithmic procedures that can be used to deduce answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them. While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple abstractions given problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This results in two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly trains an abstraction generator and solution generator. This setup effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves genera"

[ 1 3 4 1 1 0 . 0 1 5 2 : r Generalized Parallel Scaling with Interdependent Generations Harry Dong1,2, David Brandfonbrener1, Eryk Helenowski1, Yun He1, Mrinal Kumar1, Han Fang1, Yuejie Chi1,3, Karthik Abinav Sankararaman1 1Meta, 2Carnegie Mellon University, 3Yale University Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling set of > 1 responses for single input prompt. However, these parallel responses tend to be generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others. This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50% and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations, unlocking more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation technique. Date: October 2, 2025 Correspondence: Harry Dong at harryd@andrew.cmu.edu Scaling inference-time compute has given large language models (LLMs) substantial leaps in performance on difficult tasks. Many scaling methods concentrate resources to generate single high-quality response such as with chains-of-thought (CoTs) (Wei et al., 2022) and decompositions of problem into parallel substeps (Rodionov et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025b). However, there are also instances where high-quality set of responses for each input is needed, such as in the case of output synthesis, best-of-N selection, and synthetic data generat"

Introducing reasoning abstractions in reinforcement learning improves structured exploration and generalization for complex problem-solving.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them. While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in guiding meaningful exploration.

Такая структура позволяет избежать многословных и неэффективных цепочек рассуждений, вместо этого направляя модель к алгоритмическому мышлению с переиспользованием процедур. Эксперименты показывают, что выделение дополнительного времени на генерацию абстракций при инференсе даёт больший прирост производительности, чем просто генерация большего числа решений."

Bridge enhances parallel LLM inference by generating interdependent responses, improving accuracy and consistency with minimal additional parameters.  					AI-generated summary 				 Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of N>1 responses for a single input prompt. However, these N parallel responses tend to be generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others. This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50% and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations, unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation technique.
