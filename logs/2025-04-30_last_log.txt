[ 1 9 6 7 0 2 . 4 0 5 2 : r Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption Wenxiao Wang 1 Parsa Hosseini 1 Soheil FeiziChain-of-thought prompting has demonstrated great success in facilitating the reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we explore how these enhanced reasoning abilities can be exploited to improve the robustness of large language models in tasks that are not necessarily reasoning-focused. In particular, we show how wide range of large language models exhibit significantly improved robustness against reference corruption using simple method called chain-of-defensive-thought, where only few exemplars with structured and defensive reasoning are provided as demonstrations. Empirically, the improvements can be astounding, especially given the simplicity and applicability of the method. For example, in the Natural Questions task, the accuracy of GPT-4o degrades from 60% to as low as 3% with standard prompting when 1 out of 10 references provided is corrupted with prompt injection attacks. In contrast, GPT4o using chain-of-defensive-thought prompting maintains an accuracy of 50%. 1. Introduction Large language models (Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) can, at least in principle, respond accordingly to external references provided to them, enabling the prosperity of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020) as means of addressing their inherent limitations with up-to-date or specialized knowledge. However, the performance of large language models can be greatly affected when any of the provided references are compromised (Zou et al., 2024; Greshake et al., 2023), raising reliability concerns. Partially inspired by the success of chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022) in facilitating reasoning of large language models, we explore how the robustness of large lan1Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA. Correspondence to: Wenxiao Wang <wwx@umd.edu>. Figure 1. Illustrative exemplars for standard prompting v.s. chainof-defensive-thought prompting. Chain-of-defensive-thought uses exemplars to prompt models to generate chain of defensive thought (e.g. Reason highlighted above) before answering. guage models against reference corruption can be unlocked through structured reasoning, even for tasks that are not necessarily reasoning-focused. In particular, we show how wide range of large language models exhibit significantly improved robustness against reference corruption with simple method called chain-of-defensive-thought. How can large language models be made more reliable when incorporating external references that could be potentially compromised and corrupted? Consider how humans would incorporate references from mixed and potentially unreliable information sources. It is generally advisable to 1 Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption Figure 2. Chain-of-defensive-thought unlocks the robustness in wide range of large language models against reference corruption. Here the robustness metric is the average robust accuracy over two benchmarks where for each benchmark the minimum accuracy obtained across attack types is accounted. Please refer to section 3 for evaluation details. first examine all relevant pieces and cross-check different sources before reaching conclusion. Chain-of-defensivethought uses few exemplars (as exemplified in Figure 1) to help large language models mimic such structured reasoning process and generate chain of defensive thought before giving the final answer. Empirically, our evaluations show that chain-of-defensivethought significantly boosts the robustness of wide range of models against reference corruption on Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and RealTime QA (Kasai et al., 2023) benchmarks, as summarized in Figure 2. In many cases, the improvements are astounding. For example, on Natural Questions, the accuracy of GPT-4o degrades from 60% to as low as 3% when 1 out of 10 references provided is corrupted with prompt injection attacks (Greshake et al., 2023), while GPT-4o with chain-of-defensive-thought prompting still maintains an accuracy of 50%. These gains are particularly remarkable given the fact that chain-of-defensive-thought is prompting only approach: prompting only approach requires no large dataset and is naturally applicable to open models as well as to black-box APIs, granting chain-of-defensive-thought the potential of becoming one of the de facto baselines for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), LLMs with web search, as well as any other applications incorporating external references. 2. Chain-of-Defensive-Thought How can language models be made more reliable when incorporating external references that could be potentially compromised and corrupted? Consider how we as humans would incorporate references from mixed and potentially unreliable information sources. Although people may have their own preferences, it is generally considered advisable to examine all relevant pieces and cross-check different sources before reaching final conclusion. Such structured reasoning plays an important role in the processing of complex and conflicting information. The key idea of chain-of-defensive-thought prompting is to guide language models to generate chain of defensive thought that mimics this reasoning process, and therefore making the eventual responses more reliable when potentially corrupted references are provided. Chain-of-defensive-thought achieves its goal through fewshow exemplars (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022), i.e. few examples in the prompt that demonstrate the task(s). Specifically, considering the following as typical template of exemplars used in standard prompting to instruct language models to incorporate external references (a.k.a. contexts): Context information is below. --------------------- <context 1> <context 2> ... 2 Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption <context n> --------------------- <instruction> Query: <a query> Answer: <a response to the query> Chain-of-defensive-thought prompting includes the following modifications to standard prompting: 1.

[30.04.2025 23:11] Abstract 18. We investigate reinforcement learning (RL) for privileged planning in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based, but these methods do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is scalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning....

Chain-of-thought prompting has demonstrated great success in facilitating the reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we explore how these enhanced reasoning abilities can be exploited to improve the robustness of large language models in tasks that are not necessarily reasoning-focused. In particular, we show how a wide range of large language models exhibit significantly improved robustness against reference corruption using a simple method called chain-of-defensive-thought, where only a few exemplars with structured and defensive reasoning are provided as demonstrations. Empirically, the improvements can be astounding, especially given the simplicity and applicability of the method. For example, in the Natural Questions task, the accuracy of GPT-4o degrades from 60% to as low as 3% with standard prompting when 1 out of 10 references provided is corrupted with prompt injection attacks. In contrast, GPT-4o using chain-of-defensive-thought prompting maintains an accuracy of 50%.

Эксперименты показывают впечатляющие результаты, особенно учитывая простоту метода.
