Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant challenges in multi-hop question answering (MHQA), where complex queries require synthesizing information across multiple document chunks. Existing approaches typically rely on iterative LLM-based query rewriting and routing, resulting in high computational costs due to repeated LLM invocations and multi-stage processes. To address these limitations, we propose TreeHop, an embedding-level framework without the need for LLMs in query refinement. TreeHop dynamically updates query embeddings by fusing semantic information from prior queries and retrieved documents, enabling iterative retrieval through embedding-space operations alone. This method replaces the traditional "Retrieve-Rewrite-Vectorize-Retrieve" cycle with a streamlined "Retrieve-Embed-Retrieve" loop, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, a rule-based stop criterion is introduced to further prune redundant retrievals, balancing efficiency and recall rate. Experimental results show that TreeHop rivals advanced RAG methods across three open-domain MHQA datasets, achieving comparable performance with only 5\%-0.4\% of the model parameter size and reducing the query latency by approximately 99\% compared to concurrent approaches. This makes TreeHop a faster and more cost-effective solution for deployment in a range of knowledge-intensive applications. For reproducibility purposes, codes and data are available here: https://github.com/allen-li1231/TreeHop.

Unlike traditional methods that rely on large language models (LLMs) for query rewriting, TreeHop operates at the embedding level, dynamically updating query embeddings by integrating information from previous queries and retrieved documents. This approach simplifies the retrieval process by replacing the complex cycle of retrieving, rewriting, and vectorizing with a more efficient 'Retrieve-Embed-Retrieve' loop. Experimental results demonstrate that TreeHop achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational costs and faster query processing times, making it a practical solution for knowledge-intensive applications.", title='Streamlining Multi-Hop Question Answering with TreeHop'))
