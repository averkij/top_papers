Text:"ISDrama: Immersive Spatial Drama Generation through Multimodal Prompting Yu Zhang * 1 Wenxiang Guo * 1 Changhao Pan * 1 Zhiyuan Zhu * 1 Tao Jin 1 Zhou ZhaoMultimodal immersive spatial drama generation focuses on creating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody based on multimodal prompts, with potential applications in AR, VR, and others. This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control.

Introduction Binaural hearing provides localization cues through sound fields, enhancing the human spatial perception of the environment. This capability is critical for applications requiring deep immersion, like movies, VR, and AR (Fitria, *Equal contribution Correspondence to: Zhou Zhao <zhaozhou@zju.edu.cn>, Tao Jin <jintao@zju.edu.cn>. 1Zhejiang Univeristy. Preprint. Under review. Figure 1. ISDrama uses scripts as content, prompt audio to guide timbre, and spatial information from multimodal prompts, to create continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody. 2023). Compared to non-linguistic binaural audio (Sun et al., 2024), generating binaural speech is more challenging yet promising. Specifically, based on multimodal prompts from diverse contexts, generating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody can create immersive spatial drama. This new task enhances storytelling, offering an immersive emotional and spatial engagement, and an integration of virtual and reality. With deep learning advancements, progress has been made in synthesizing speech with prosody modeling (Ju et al., 2024; Du et al., 2024) and generating binaural audio from monaural audio based on input multimodal prompts (Li et al., 2024d; Parida et al., 2022). Cascading these methods to generate continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with prosody modeling seems to be viable approach. However, this cascading method will disrupt the integration of prosody and spatial modeling, leading to mismatches and error accumulation. This highlights the need for unified multimodal immersive spatial drama generation framework. To date, one-stage multimodal immersive spatial drama generation remains an unexplored domain, focusing on creating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody. As shown in Figure 1, this task requires inputting ISDrama: Immersive Spatial Drama Generation through Multimodal Prompting scripts as content and prompt audio to guide timbre, along with extracting spatial information in pose (including position, orientation, and movement speed) and scene from multimodal prompts (e.g., silent video, textual prompts, geometric poses) to cover wider range of applications. Therefore, this task extends beyond video dubbing, enabling precise and flexible spatial control. Additionally, drama demands prosodic expressiveness that far exceeds normal speech. Not only does dramatic prosody require learning accent and articulation from prompt audio, but it also integrates semantics to enhance the modeling of semantically aligned emotion and rhythm. Currently, multimodal immersive spatial drama generation encounters three major challenges: 1) Lack of high-quality annotated recorded data. Simulated data fails to capture the complex, dramatic prosody and the precise effects of real-world spatial scenes, positions, and orientations. While some datasets (Richard et al., 2021) use binaural devices to simulate human interaural phase difference (IPD) and interaural level difference (ILD), they suffer from limitations in scale, dramatic prosody, and multimodal prompts. 2) Challenges in extracting unified pose representations from multimodal prompts. Silent video, geometric pose, and textual prompts provide spatial information, including positions, orientations, and movement speed for various scenarios. While some methods extract positional information from visual or positional inputs (Leng et al., 2022), they cannot learn unified pose representations across more diverse scenarios. 3) Difficulty in one-stage modeling dramatic prosody and spatial immersion. Existing monaural speech models (Du et al., 2024) struggle to simultaneously model dramatic prosody, which requires semantic alignment in the temporal-frequency domain, and spatial information, which spans the spatial-temporal dimensions. To address these challenges, we first introduce MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, comprising binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. The dataset includes 97.82 hours of speech data recorded by 21 speakers across three scenes. Next, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model based on multimodal prompting. ISDrama generates high-quality, continuous, multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody and spatial immersion, driven by multimodal prompts. To extract unified pose representation from multimodal prompts, we design the Multimodal Pose Encoder, contrastive learning-based framework that encodes not only position and head orientation but also radial velocity, accounting for the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers. Meanwhile, we develop the Immersive Drama Transformer, flow-based MambaTransformer model capable of generating immersive spatial drama effectively and stably. Within this model, we "

"Multimodal immersive spatial drama generation focuses on creating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody based on multimodal prompts, with potential applications in AR, VR, and others. This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos and dataset are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/ISDramaDemo."
