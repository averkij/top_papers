Yet, in this work we identify systematic issues that have resulted in distorted playing field.

Both these policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time. Providers like Google and OpenAI have received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the arena, respectively. In contrast, combined 83 open-weight models have only received an estimated 29.7% of the total data.
