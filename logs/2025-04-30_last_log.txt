ROUMELIOTIS, University of Peloponnese, Greece RAHUL HARSHA CHEPPALLY, Kansas State University, USA MARCO FLORES CALERO, Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas, Ecuador MANOJ KARKEE, Cornell University, USA 5 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 8 3 7 8 1 . 4 0 5 2 : r This paper presents groundbreaking and comprehensive review, the first of its kind, focused on 3D object detection with Vision-Language Models (VLMs), rapidly advancing frontier in multimodal AI. Using hybrid search strategy combining academic databases and AI-powered engines, we curated and analyzed over 100 state-of-the-art papers. Our study begins by contextualizing 3D object detection within traditional pipelines, examining methods like PointNet++, PV-RCNN, and VoteNet that utilize point clouds and voxel grids for geometric inference. We then trace the shift toward VLM-driven systems, where models such as CLIP, PaLM-E, and RoboFlamingo-Plus enhance spatial understanding through language-guided reasoning, zero-shot generalization, and instruction-based interaction. We investigate the architectural foundations enabling this transition, including pretraining techniques, spatial alignment modules, and cross-modal fusion strategies. Visualizations and benchmark comparisons reveal VLMs unique capabilities in semantic abstraction and open-vocabulary detection, despite trade-offs in speed and annotation cost. Our comparative synthesis highlights key challenges such as spatial misalignment, occlusion sensitivity, and limited real-time viability, alongside emerging solutions like 3D scene graphs, synthetic captioning, and multimodal reinforcement learning. This review not only consolidates the technical landscape of VLM-based 3D detection but also provides forward-looking roadmap, identifying promising innovations and deployment opportunities. It serves as foundational reference for researchers seeking to harness th"

Instruction-based image editing enables robust image modification via natural language prompts, yet current methods face a precision-efficiency tradeoff. Fine-tuning methods demand significant computational resources and large datasets, while training-free techniques struggle with instruction comprehension and edit quality. We resolve this dilemma by leveraging large-scale Diffusion Transformer (DiT)' enhanced generation capacity and native contextual awareness. Our solution introduces three contributions: (1) an in-context editing framework for zero-shot instruction compliance using in-context prompting, avoiding structural changes; (2) a LoRA-MoE hybrid tuning strategy that enhances flexibility with efficient adaptation and dynamic expert routing, without extensive retraining; and (3) an early filter inference-time scaling method using vision-language models (VLMs) to select better initial noise early, improving edit quality. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our method's superiority: it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while requiring only 0.5% training data and 1% trainable parameters compared to conventional baselines. This work establishes a new paradigm that enables high-precision yet efficient instruction-guided editing. Codes and demos can be found in https://river-zhang.github.io/ICEdit-gh-pages/.

"Instruction-based image editing enables robust image modification via natural language prompts, yet current methods face a precision-efficiency tradeoff. Fine-tuning methods demand significant computational resources and large datasets, while training-free techniques struggle with instruction comprehension and edit quality. We resolve this dilemma by leveraging large-scale Diffusion Transformer (DiT)' enhanced generation capacity and native contextual awareness. Our solution introduces three contributions: (1) an in-context editing framework for zero-shot instruction compliance using in-context prompting, avoiding structural changes; (2) a LoRA-MoE hybrid tuning strategy that enhances flexibility with efficient adaptation and dynamic expert routing, without extensive retraining; and (3) an early filter inference-time scaling method using vision-language models (VLMs) to select better initial noise early, improving edit quality. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our method's superiority: it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while requiring only 0.5% training data and 1% trainable parameters compared to conventional baselines. This work establishes a new paradigm that enables high-precision yet efficient instruction-guided editing. Codes and demos can be found in https://river-zhang.github.io/ICEdit-gh-pages/."

This review provides a systematic analysis of comprehensive survey of 3D object detection with vision-language models(VLMs) , a rapidly advancing area at the intersection of 3D vision and multimodal AI. By examining over 100 research papers, we provide the first systematic analysis dedicated to 3D object detection with vision-language models. We begin by outlining the unique challenges of 3D object detection with vision-language models, emphasizing differences from 2D detection in spatial reasoning and data complexity. Traditional approaches using point clouds and voxel grids are compared to modern vision-language frameworks like CLIP and 3D LLMs, which enable open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot generalization. We review key architectures, pretraining strategies, and prompt engineering methods that align textual and 3D features for effective 3D object detection with vision-language models. Visualization examples and evaluation benchmarks are discussed to illustrate performance and behavior. Finally, we highlight current challenges, such as limited 3D-language datasets and computational demands, and propose future research directions to advance 3D object detection with vision-language models. >Object Detection, Vision-Language Models, Agents, VLMs, LLMs, AI
