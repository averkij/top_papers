Introduction Humans explore and interact with the 3D physical world by perceiving their surroundings, taking actions, and engaging with others. Through these interactions, they form mental models that simulate the complexities of their environment. With just glimpse, humans can construct an internal 3D representation of their surroundings in their minds, enabling reasoning, navigation, and problem-solving. This remarkable ability has long been central challenge in the development of artificial intelligence. In this work, we introduce GenEx, platform designed to push this boundary by Generating an Explorable world and facilitating explorations in this generated world. GenEx combines two interconnected components: an imaginative world, which dynamically generates 3D environments for exploration, and an embodied agent, which interacts with this environment to refine its understanding and decision-making. Together, these components form symbiotic system that enables AI to simulate, explore, and learn in ways similar to human cognitive processes. We begin by constructing an imaginative world that captures 360, 3D environment grounded in the physical world, leveraging recent advancements in Generative AI. Starting from single image, the model generates new environments expansively and dynamically while maintaining coherence and 3D consistency, even during longdistance exploration. This boundless landscape provides endless opportunities for AI agents to explore and interact. The environment is brought into life in the form of diffusion video generation, conditioned on moving angle, distance, and single initial view to serve as starting point. To address fieldof-view constraints, we utilize panoramic representations and train our video diffusion models with spherical-consistent learning techniques. This ensures the generated environments maintain coherence and 3D consistency, even during long-distance exploration. To anchor our video generation model in the physical world, we curate training data from physics engines like Unreal En2024-12-13 gine, enabling realistic and immersive outputs. Within this imaginative landscape, embodied agents play crucial role. Enhanced by GPTs, these agents can explore unseen parts of the physical world with imagined observations to refine their understanding of surroundings, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. Furthermore, GenEx supports multi-agent scenarios, allowing agents to mentally navigate others positions, share imagined beliefs, and collaboratively refine their strategies. In summary, GenEx represents transformative step forward in the development of AI, offering platform that bridges the generative and physically grounded world. By enabling AI to explore, learn, and interact in boundless, dynamically generated environments, GenEx opens the door to applications ranging from real-world navigation, interactive gaming, and VR/AR to embodied AI. 2. Generating an Explorable World We define the explorable generative world and the problem in 2.1, present the world initialization in 2.2 and world transition in 2.3. 2.1. Problem Formulation Defining an explorable generative world. We define an explorable generative world as an AIgenerated virtual environment, constrained to the agents immediate surroundings. The generative world is both physically plausible and visually coherent. This environment is represented by the agents egocentric panoramic observations, denoted as x. While is synthesized, it remains grounded in intuitive physical principles and realistic appearance, akin to high-fidelity, physically realistic video game environment. Crucially, the explorable nature of our generative world ensures the agents experience is not limited to static scene. Instead, the environment dynamically evolves in response to the agents movements and actions, simulating continuous and coherent exploration. Formally, let 𝑎𝑡 be the agents action at step 𝑡, encompassGenEx: Generating an Explorable World 𝑡 , 𝑥1 𝑡 , . . . , 𝑥𝑆 ing both view rotation 𝛼 and forward distance 𝑑.

This evolution requires the transition from traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), which excel at generating textual responses, to Large Action Models (LAMs), designed for action generation and execution within dynamic environments. Enabled by agent systems, LAMs hold the potential to transform AI from passive language understanding to active task completion, marking significant milestone in the progression toward artificial general intelligence. In this paper, we present comprehensive framework for developing LAMs, offering systematic approach to their creation, from inception to deployment. We begin with an overview of LAMs, highlighting their unique characteristics and delineating their differences from LLMs. Using Windows OS-based agent as case study, we provide detailed, step-by-step guide on the key stages of LAM development, including data collection, model training, environment integration, grounding, and evaluation. This generalizable workflow can serve as blueprint for creating functional LAMs in various application domains. We conclude by identifying the current limitations of LAMs and discussing directions for future research and industrial deployment, emphasizing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in realizing the full potential of LAMs in real-world applications.

This solver achieves 3 runtime speedup compared to state-of-the-art ReFlow inversion and editing techniques, while delivering smaller reconstruction errors and superior editing results in training-free mode. The code is available at this URL. 1. Introduction The ability to accurately and efficiently invert generative models is critical for enabling applications such as semantic image editing, data reconstruction, and latent space manipulation. Inversion, which involves mapping observed data back to its latent representation, serves as the foundation for fine-grained control over generative processes. Achieving balance between computational efficiency and numerical accuracy in inversion is particularly challenging for diffusion FireFlow: Fast Inversion of Rectified Flow for Image Semantic Editing models, which rely on iterative processes to bridge data and latent spaces. Diffusion models have long been regarded as the gold standard for high-quality data generation (Ramesh et al., 2022; Rombach et al., 2022; Podell et al., 2024) and inversion due to their ability to capture complex distributions through stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Their success has often overshadowed deterministic approaches such as Rectified Flow (ReFlow) models (Liu et al., 2023), which replace stochastic sampling with ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for faster and more efficient transformations. Despite skepticism about their capabilities, ReFlow models have demonstrated competitive generative performance, with the FLUX model (Forest) emerging as leading opensource example. FLUX achieves remarkable instructionfollowing capabilities, challenging the assumption that diffusion models are inherently superior. These advances motivate closer investigation of ReFlow-based models, particularly in the context of inversion and editing, to develop simple and effective methods. ReFlow models possess an underutilized advantage: welltrained ReFlow model learns nearly constant velocity dynamics across the data distribution, ensuring stability and bounded velocity approximation errors. However, existing inversion methods for ReFlow models fail to fully exploit this property. Current approaches rely on generic Euler solvers that prioritize each steps computational efficiency at the expense of accuracy or incur additional costs to achieve higher precision. As result, the potential of ReFlow models to deliver fast and accurate inversion remains untapped. In this work, we introduce novel numerical solver for the ODEs underlying ReFlow models, addressing the challenges of inversion and editing. Our method achieves second-order precision while retaining the computational cost of firstorder solver. By reusing intermediate velocity approximations, our approach reduces redundant evaluations, stabilizes the inversion process, and fully leverages the constant velocity property of well-trained ReFlow models. As shown in Table 1, our approach is the first to provide solver that strikes an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, enabling ReFlow models to excel in inversion and editing tasks. By combining computational efficiency, numerical robustness, and simplicity, our method offers scalable solution for real-world tasks requiring high fidelity and realtime performance, advancing the utility of ReFlow-based generative models like FLUX. 2.

Understanding, navigating, and exploring the 3D physical real world has long been a central challenge in the development of artificial intelligence. In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.

"Understanding, navigating, and exploring the 3D physical real world has long been a central challenge in the development of artificial intelligence. In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration."

As AI continues to advance, there is a growing demand for systems that go beyond language-based assistance and move toward intelligent agents capable of performing real-world actions. This evolution requires the transition from traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), which excel at generating textual responses, to Large Action Models (LAMs), designed for action generation and execution within dynamic environments. Enabled by agent systems, LAMs hold the potential to transform AI from passive language understanding to active task completion, marking a significant milestone in the progression toward artificial general intelligence.   In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for developing LAMs, offering a systematic approach to their creation, from inception to deployment. We begin with an overview of LAMs, highlighting their unique characteristics and delineating their differences from LLMs. Using a Windows OS-based agent as a case study, we provide a detailed, step-by-step guide on the key stages of LAM development, including data collection, model training, environment integration, grounding, and evaluation. This generalizable workflow can serve as a blueprint for creating functional LAMs in various application domains. We conclude by identifying the current limitations of LAMs and discussing directions for future research and industrial deployment, emphasizing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in realizing the full potential of LAMs in real-world applications.

Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. To tackle this challenge, we propose FreeScale, a tuning-free inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation via scale fusion. Specifically, FreeScale processes information from different receptive scales and then fuses it by extracting desired frequency components. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models. Notably, compared with the previous best-performing method, FreeScale unlocks the generation of 8k-resolution images for the first time.

Long-context LLMs have enabled numerous downstream applications but also introduced significant challenges related to computational and memory efficiency. To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context inference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing benchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of the KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging 12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric analysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear RNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention, KV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression. The evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that sub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly. Dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong performance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in long-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench.

"Long-context LLMs have enabled numerous downstream applications but also introduced significant challenges related to computational and memory efficiency. To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context inference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing benchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of the KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading.

Though Rectified Flows (ReFlows) with distillation offers a promising way for fast sampling, its fast inversion transforms images back to structured noise for recovery and following editing remains unsolved. This paper introduces FireFlow, a simple yet effective zero-shot approach that inherits the startling capacity of ReFlow-based models (such as FLUX) in generation while extending its capabilities to accurate inversion and editing in 8 steps. We first demonstrate that a carefully designed numerical solver is pivotal for ReFlow inversion, enabling accurate inversion and reconstruction with the precision of a second-order solver while maintaining the practical efficiency of a first-order Euler method. This solver achieves a 3times runtime speedup compared to state-of-the-art ReFlow inversion and editing techniques, while delivering smaller reconstruction errors and superior editing results in a training-free mode. The code is available at https://github.com/HolmesShuan/FireFlow{this URL}.
