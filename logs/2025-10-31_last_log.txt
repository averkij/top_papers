Text:"5 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 1 7 0 0 6 2 . 0 1 5 2 : r a thra@di.ku.dk mm@di.ku.dk tr@di.ku.dk c.lioma@di.ku.dk Abstract The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including AI in Science (AIS), should be done following the principles of responsible AI. Progress in responsible AI is often quantified through evaluation metrics, yet there has been less work on assessing the robustness and reliability of the metrics themselves. We reflect on prior work that examines the robustness of fairness metrics for recommender systems as type of AI application and summarise their key takeaways into set of non-exhaustive guidelines for developing reliable metrics of responsible AI. Our guidelines apply to broad spectrum of AI applications, including AIS. Keywords: responsible AI, fairness evaluation, recommender systems Recent legislation, such as the EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act and the EU Digital Services Act, has increasingly emphasised the responsible development of AI applications [European Parliament and Council, 2022, 2024] to protect their users and minimise harms. One such AI application is Recommender Systems (RSs). RSs are highly useful in finding relevant items that match user needs, preferences, or interests [Aggarwal, 2016]. These systems are widely used for both highand low-stakes activities in professional and personal settings. In professional settings, among other use cases, RSs can be used to suggest scientific papers and citations for researchers [Kreutz and Schenkel, 2022, Färber and Jatowt, 2020], or job positions for jobseekers [Siting et al., 2012]. Prior work has investigated aspects of responsible AI in RSs, such as fairness and bias [Wang et al., 2023, Klimashevskaia et al., 2024]. Biases may exist in the data, the algorithm, or the evaluation pipeline of an RS; all these biases can contribute to unfairness. While there is no universal definition, fairness in RSs is commonly understood as providing equal treatment or equitable outcomes to the RS stakeh"

[31.10.2025 00:54] Abstract 7. Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image, while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged.
