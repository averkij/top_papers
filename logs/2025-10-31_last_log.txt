Figure 1: Surfer 2 state-of-the-art performance on WebVoyager, WebArena, OSWorld E2E, and AndroidWorld. Human performance is indicated when available.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) unlocked remarkable reasoning capabilities for agentic use cases [1]. However, turning these capabilities into reliable, generalpurpose agents that operate autonomously in Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) on complex, real-world tasks remains challenging. In recent years, one dominant path has been to train increasingly large models with minimal scaffolding like tool-call [2, 3] to improve agentic capabilities [4, 5, 6]. In contrast, this work presents an alternative perspective: with proper orchestration and system design, existing state-of-the-art models can achieve human-level performance and exceed prior systems across multiple benchmarks. Prior approaches require environment-specific adaptations, such as DOM parsers for web navigation, accessibility trees for mobile interfaces, or specialized APIs for desktop applications, limiting generalization across diverse digital environments. This work introduces Surfer 2, unified, hierarchical agent architecture designed for complex tasks across desktop, web, and mobile environments using purely visual interaction. Surfer 2 comprises three components: Orchestrator (optional high-level planner), Navigator (lowlevel GUI executor), and Validator (evaluation module). Surfer 2 integrates third-party frontier models and Companys Holo1.5 models [7] in design that separates long-term strategic planning from shortterm tactical execution. key design insight in Surfer 2 is architectural flexibility. It can enable or bypass the Orchestrator to match task complexity. For long-horizon problems, the Orchestrator runs as highlevel planner in the plan-and-act style [8], where it decomposes the user task into verifiable goals, plans ahead, and delegates targeted subtasks to the Navigator. For simple tasks, the Orchestrator is bypassed and the Navigator is invoked directly. Built on our previous SurferH agent [9], the Navigator follows ReAct (reason+act) loop [10]. It perceives the environment purely via screenshots, reasons about the next step, and executes constrained keyboard and mouse-level controls with pixel-accurate UI localization from Holo1.5. Upon subtask completion, Validator inspects the latest screenshots, the execution history, and the proposed answer to assess subtask success in one of two ways: (1) if the Orchestrator is enabled, it leverages the Validators report and either advances to the next subgoal or replans accordingly, or (2) if the Orchestrator is disabled, the Validators feedback is sent directly to the Navigator, which integrates it into its reasoning and continues the ReAct loop until the task is completed or termination condition is reached. Without task-specific fine-tuning, Surfer 2 attains state-of-the-art results on four major benchmarks spanning different Computer Use environments (web browser, desktop, mobile): WebVoyager [11] and WebArena [12], OSWorld [13], and AndroidWorld [14]. On OSWorld and AndroidWorld, Surfer 2 surpasses the human baseline, underscoring that expert agent design is as crucial as model capability.The development of Computer Use agents capable of controlling computers, web browsers, and mobile devices represents key frontier in AI. In many real-world scenarios, agents encounter tools and software for which no API or Model Context Protocol (MCP) is available, leaving GUIs as the only viable control surface. Consequently, recent research has focused on enabling general-purpose agents to perceive, reason about, and act within GUIs, transforming visual interaction into universal interface for autonomous computer use."

Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments remains an open challenge, as prior systems rely on environment-specific interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long task horizons. Our system achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2 exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal cost-efficiency.
