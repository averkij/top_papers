Text:"Agent-R: Training Language Model Agents to Reflect via Iterative Self-Training Siyu Yuan*1,2, Zehui Chen*2, Zhiheng Xi1,2, Junjie Ye1,2, Zhengyin Du2 and Jiecao Chen2 *Equal contributions, 1Fudan University, 2ByteDance Seed 5 2 0 2 0 2 ] A . [ 1 5 2 4 1 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) agents are increasingly pivotal for addressing complex tasks in interactive and agentic environments. Existing work primarily focuses on enhancing performance through behavior cloning from stronger experts, yet such approaches often falter in real-world applications, mainly due to the inability to recover from errors. However, step-level critique data is notoriously difficult and expensive to collect. Automating and dynamically constructing self-critique datasets is thus crucial to empowering models with intelligent agent capabilities. In this work, we propose an iterative self-training framework, Agent-R, that enables language Agent to Reflect on the fly. Unlike traditional methods that reward or penalize actions solely based on correctness, our approach leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct training samples that recover correct trajectories from erroneous ones. key challenge of agent task reflection lies in the necessity for timely revision rather than waiting until the end of rollout to revise errors. To address this, we introduce model-guided critique construction mechanism: the actor model identifies the first error step (within its current capability) in failed trajectory. Starting from it, we splice it with the adjacent correct path, which shares the same parent node in the tree. This strategy enables the model to learn reflection based on its current policy, therefore yielding better learning efficiency. To further explore the scalability of this self-improvement paradigm, we investigate iterative refinement of both error correction capabilities and dataset construction. Our findings demonstrate that this approach continuously improves the"

Recent advancements in large multimodal model (LMM)-based mobile agents have demonstrated the ability to perceive and act in mobile environments on behalf of users. However, current approaches face significant limitations: they fall short in addressing real-world human needs, struggle with reasoning-intensive and long-horizon tasks, and lack mechanisms to learn and improve from prior experiences. To overcome 1University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign 2Alibaba Group.

By hierarchical, we mean an explicit separation of highlevel planning and low-level action execution. The framework comprises Manager, responsible for devising overall plans by breaking down complex tasks into subgoals, and four subordinate agentsPerceptor, Operator, Action Reflector, and Notetakerwhich handle fine-grained visual perception, immediate action execution, error verification, and information aggregation, respectively. Mobile-Agent-E also features novel selfevolution module which maintains persistent long-term memory comprising Tips and Shortcuts.

Shortcuts are reusable, executable sequences of atomic operations tailored Mobile-Agent-E: Self-Evolving Mobile Assistant for Complex Tasks for specific subroutines.

Empirical results show that MobileAgent-E achieves 22% absolute improvement over previous state-of-the-art approaches across three foundation model backbones.

Code and data are publicly available for research purposes at https: //x-plug.github.io/MobileAgent. 1. Introduction Smartphones have become integral to our daily lives, transforming the way we connect, work, and find entertainment. Yet, the average 4.5 hours people spend on their phones daily* often includes moments of frustration. Tedious tasks, such as deal hunting across multiple apps or gathering scattered information from various websites, often make us wish for smart mobile assistant to ease these burdens. Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) (OpenAI, 2024; Anthropic, 2024; Team et al., 2024) have led to the emergence of LMM-based GUI agents (Wang et al., 2024c; Nguyen et al., 2024) capable of perceiving and acting in the Web, PC, and mobile environments on behalf of human users. Despite these initial successes, current research on mobile agents (Wang et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024) has yet to fully address the challenges of real-world mobile tasks. We identify two key limitations below. First, we observe significant gap between the capabilities of current mobile agents and the demands of real-world scenarios. While existing mobile agent tasks are typically short, straightforward, and goal-oriented, such as Navigate to nearby gas station (Wang et al., 2024a), tasks that better reflect actual human needs are far more complex. These tasks often require combination of (1) intensive reasoning to address multiple constraints, such as balancing various factors or criteria; (2) long-horizon planning, which may involve lengthy sequence of steps across multiple apps; and (3) exploration, where the instructions can be vague and require active information gathering rather than following fixed trajectory. For instance, as shown in Figure 1, online shopping often involves navigating across different apps to compare prices and find the best deal. Furthermore, the highly dynamic nature of mobile environments, charac- *https://explodingtopics.com/blog/ smartphone-usage-stats 2 terized by pop-up advertisements and frequently changing app layouts, poses additional challenges in tackling these complex real-world tasks. Second, unlike humans, who quickly adapt and become proficient with new devices or apps, current mobile agents lack the ability to learn from prior experiences. For example, when human user first opens an app like Maps, it may take some trial and error to understand the layout and successfully perform search. However, with each interaction, the user learns, becoming faster and more accurate the next time. In contrast, existing mobile agents treat every task as if it were their first attempt, allocating the same computational resources at each step and repeating the same mistakes, regardless of how many times they perform the same task. This inability to accumulate knowledge and refine actions from past experiences severely limits their ability to handle the aforementioned complex, long-horizon tasks, where subroutines such as searching and creating notes are often shared across different objectives. To address these limitations, we propose Mobile-AgentE, hierarchical multi-agent framework capable of selfevolution through past experiences. Mobile-Agent-E explicitly disentangles high-level planningsuch as decomposing task into smaller subgoalsfrom low-level actions, which involves determining specific actions and their parameters "

[ 1 7 8 6 0 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r Abstract In this paper, we propose novel audio-driven talking head method capable of simultaneously generating highly expressive facial expressions and hand gestures. Unlike existing methods that focus on generating full-body or half-body poses, we investigate the challenges of co-speech gesture generation and identify the weak correspondence between audio features and full-body gestures as key limitation. To address this, we redefine the task as two-stage process. In the first stage, we generate hand poses directly from audio input, leveraging the strong correlation between audio signals and hand movements. In the second stage, we employ diffusion model to synthesize video frames, incorporating the hand poses generated in the first stage to produce realistic facial expressions and body movements. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, such as CyberHost (Lin et al., 2024) and Vlogger (Corona et al., 2024), in terms of both visual quality and synchronization accuracy. This work provides new perspective on audio-driven gesture generation and robust framework for creating expressive and natural talking head animations. 1. Introduction Audio-driven human video generation, which aims to create synchronized facial expressions and body gestures, remains critical research area with wide range of applications. While there have been noteworthy achievements in generating synchronized facial expressions from audio (Tian et al., 2025) and human-centric videos (Kong et al., 2025), challenges persist in creating audio-synchronized human videos that exhibit richly vivid motions, part"

Text:"Hunyuan3D 2.0: Scaling Diffusion Models for High Resolution Textured 3D Assets Generation Living out everyones imagination on creating and manipulating 3D assets. Hunyuan3D TeamWe present Hunyuan3D 2.0, an advanced large-scale 3D synthesis system for generating high-resolution textured 3D assets. This system includes two foundation components: large-scale shape generation model Hunyuan3D-DiT, and largescale texture synthesis model Hunyuan3D-Paint. The shape generative model, built on scalable flow-based diffusion transformer, aims to create geometry that properly aligns with given condition image, laying solid foundation for downstream applications. The texture synthesis model, benefiting from strong geometric and diffusion priors, produces high-resolution and vibrant texture maps for either generated or hand-crafted meshes. Furthermore, we build Hunyuan3D-Studio versatile, user-friendly production platform that simplifies the re-creation process of 3D assets. It allows both professional and amateur users to manipulate or even animate their meshes efficiently. We systematically evaluate our models, showing that Hunyuan3D 2.0 outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including the open-source models and closed-source models in geometry details, condition alignment, texture quality, and etc. Hunyuan3D 2.0 is publicly released in order to fill the gaps in the open-source 3D community for large-scale foundation generative models. The code and pre-trained weights of our models are available at: https://github.com/Tencent/Hunyuan3D-2. 5 2 0 2 1 2 ] . [ 1 2 0 2 2 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r Hunyuan3D team contributors are listed in the end of report. Figure 1: An overall of Hunyuan3D 2.0 system.Digital 3D assets have woven themselves into the very fabric of modern life and production. In the realms of gaming and film, these assets are vibrant expressions of creators imaginations, spreading joy and crafting immersive experiences for players and audiences alike. In the fields of physical simulation and embodied AI, 3D assets serve as essential building blocks, enabling machines and robots to mimic and comprehend the real world. Yet, the journey of creating 3D assets is anything but straightforward; it is often complex, time-consuming, and costly endeavor. typical production pipeline may involve stages like sketch design, digital modeling, and 3D texture mapping, each demanding high expertise and proficiency in digital content creation software. As result, the automated generation of high-resolution digital 3D assets has emerged as one of the most exciting and sought-after topics in recent years. Despite the importance of automated 3D generation and rapid development in image and video generation fueled by the rise of diffusion models [33, 72, 24, 47, 42], the field of 3D generation appears to be relatively stagnant in the era of large models and big data, with only handful of works making gradual progress [109, 116, 46]. Building on the 3DShape2Vectset [109] and Michelangelo [116], CLAY [111] is the first work to demonstrate the unprecedented potential of diffusion models in the 3D asset generation. Nevertheless, progress in the 3D domain remains limited. As evidenced in other fields [112, 4, 3], the prosperity of domain in the era of large models usually relies on strong open-source foundational model, such as Stable Diffusion [72, 67, 24] for image generation, LLaMA [88, 89, 22] for language models, and HunyuanVideo [42] for video generation. To this end, we present Hunyuan3D 2.0, 3D asset creation system with two strong open-sourced 3D foundation models: Hunyuan3D-DiT for generative shape creation and Hunyuan3D-Paint for generative texture synthesis. Hunyuan3D 2.0 features two-stage generation pipeline, starting with the creation of bare mesh, followed by the synthesis of texture map for that mesh. This strategy is effective for decoupling the difficulties of shape and texture generation [104] and also provides flexibility for texturing either generated or handcrafted meshes. With this architecture, our shape creation model Hunyuan3DDiT, is designed as large-scale flow-based diffusion model. As prerequisite, we first train an autoencoder Hunyuan3D-ShapeVAE using advanced techniques such as mesh surface importance sampling and variational token length to capture fine-grained details on the meshes. Then, we build up dual-single stream transformer [44] on the latent space of our VAE with the flow-matching [50, 24] objective. Our texture generation model Hunyuan3D-Paint is made of novel mesh-conditioned multi-view generation pipeline and number of sophisticated techniques for preprocessing and baking multi-view images into high-resolution texture maps. We performed an in-depth comparison of Hunyuan3D 2.0 in relation to leading 3D generation models worldwide, including three commercial closed-source end-to-end products, an end-to-end opensourced model Trellis [98], and several separate models [9, 36, 96, 108, 52, 56] for shape and texture generation. We report visual and quantitative evaluation results across three dimensions: generated textured mesh, bare mesh, and texture map. We also provided user study results on 300 test cases involving 50 participants. The comparison shows the superiority of Hunyuan3D 2.0 in alignment between conditional images and generated meshes, generation of fine-grained details, and human preference ratings.In this section, we elaborate on the model architecture of Hunyuan3D 2.0, focusing on two main components: the shape generation model and the texture generation model. Fig. 2 illustrates the pipeline of Hunyuan3D 2.0 for creating high-resolution textured 3D asset. Given an input image, Hunyuan3D-DiT initially generates high-fidelity bare mesh via the shape generation model. This model comprises Hunyuan3D-ShapeVAE and Hunyuan3D-DiT, which will be discussed in Sec. 3. Subsequently, by leveraging strong geometric priors and the input image, we introduce Hunyuan3DPaint as our texture generation model in Sec. 4. This model produces self-consistent multi-view outputs, which are used for baking high-definition texture maps. 3 Figure 2: An overall of Hunyuan3D 2.0 architecture for 3D generation. It consists of two main components: Hunyuan3D-DiT for generating bare mesh from given input image and Hunyuan3DPaint for generating textured map for the generated bare mesh.

Arık1 1Google, 2The University of Hong Kong Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance human capabilities, assisting with digital tasks from sending emails to performing data analysis. The abilities of existing LLMs at such tasks are often hindered by the lack of high-quality agent data from the corresponding environments they interact with. We propose ar - by - e ac t, data-centric framework to adapt LLM agents to any given environments without human annotations. ar - by - e ac synthesizes trajectories of agent-environment interactions based on documentations, and constructs instructions by summarizing or abstracting the interaction histories, process called backward construction. We assess the quality of our synthetic data by using them in both training-based scenarios and training-free in-context learning (ICL), where we craft innovative retrieval approaches optimized for agents. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench, WebArena, OSWorld and Spider2-V spanning across realistic coding, web, and desktop environments show the effectiveness of ar - by - e ac in various downstream agentic tasks baseline results are improved by up to 12.2% for ICL with Claude3.5 and 19.5% for training with Codestral-22B. We further demonstrate the critical role of backward construction, which provides up to 14.0% improvement for training. Our ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency provided by our synthesized data in ICL and the superiority of our retrieval pipeline over alternative approaches like conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We expect that ar - by - e ac will serve as foundation for agent data synthesis as LLMs are increasingly deployed at real-world environments. Pre-trained large language models (LLMs)"

Large Language Models (LLMs) agents are increasingly pivotal for addressing complex tasks in interactive environments. Existing work mainly focuses on enhancing performance through behavior cloning from stronger experts, yet such approaches often falter in real-world applications, mainly due to the inability to recover from errors. However, step-level critique data is difficult and expensive to collect. Automating and dynamically constructing self-critique datasets is thus crucial to empowering models with intelligent agent capabilities. In this work, we propose an iterative self-training framework, Agent-R, that enables language Agent to Reflect on the fly. Unlike traditional methods that reward or penalize actions based on correctness, Agent-R leverages MCTS to construct training data that recover correct trajectories from erroneous ones. A key challenge of agent reflection lies in the necessity for timely revision rather than waiting until the end of a rollout. To address this, we introduce a model-guided critique construction mechanism: the actor model identifies the first error step (within its current capability) in a failed trajectory. Starting from it, we splice it with the adjacent correct path, which shares the same parent node in the tree. This strategy enables the model to learn reflection based on its current policy, therefore yielding better learning efficiency. To further explore the scalability of this self-improvement paradigm, we investigate iterative refinement of both error correction capabilities and dataset construction. Our findings demonstrate that Agent-R continuously improves the model's ability to recover from errors and enables timely error correction. Experiments on three interactive environments show that Agent-R effectively equips agents to correct erroneous actions while avoiding loops, achieving superior performance compared to baseline methods (+5.59%).

Smartphones have become indispensable in modern life, yet navigating complex tasks on mobile devices often remains frustrating. Recent advancements in large multimodal model (LMM)-based mobile agents have demonstrated the ability to perceive and act in mobile environments. However, current approaches face significant limitations: they fall short in addressing real-world human needs, struggle with reasoning-intensive and long-horizon tasks, and lack mechanisms to learn and improve from prior experiences. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Mobile-Agent-E, a hierarchical multi-agent framework capable of self-evolution through past experience. By hierarchical, we mean an explicit separation of high-level planning and low-level action execution. The framework comprises a Manager, responsible for devising overall plans by breaking down complex tasks into subgoals, and four subordinate agents--Perceptor, Operator, Action Reflector, and Notetaker--which handle fine-grained visual perception, immediate action execution, error verification, and information aggregation, respectively. Mobile-Agent-E also features a novel self-evolution module which maintains a persistent long-term memory comprising Tips and Shortcuts. Tips are general guidance and lessons learned from prior tasks on how to effectively interact with the environment. Shortcuts are reusable, executable sequences of atomic operations tailored for specific subroutines. The inclusion of Tips and Shortcuts facilitates continuous refinement in performance and efficiency. Alongside this framework, we introduce Mobile-Eval-E, a new benchmark featuring complex mobile tasks requiring long-horizon, multi-app interactions. Empirical results show that Mobile-Agent-E achieves a 22% absolute improvement over previous state-of-the-art approaches across three foundation model backbones.

"Smartphones have become indispensable in modern life, yet navigating complex tasks on mobile devices often remains frustrating. Recent advancements in large multimodal model (LMM)-based mobile agents have demonstrated the ability to perceive and act in mobile environments. However, current approaches face significant limitations: they fall short in addressing real-world human needs, struggle with reasoning-intensive and long-horizon tasks, and lack mechanisms to learn and improve from prior experiences. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Mobile-Agent-E, a hierarchical multi-agent framework capable of self-evolution through past experience. By hierarchical, we mean an explicit separation of high-level planning and low-level action execution. The framework comprises a Manager, responsible for devising overall plans by breaking down complex tasks into subgoals, and four subordinate agents--Perceptor, Operator, Action Reflector, and Notetaker--which handle fine-grained visual perception, immediate action execution, error verification, and information aggregation, respectively. Mobile-Agent-E also features a novel self-evolution module which maintains a persistent long-term memory comprising Tips and Shortcuts. Tips are general guidance and lessons learned from prior tasks on how to effectively interact with the environment. Shortcuts are reusable, executable sequences of atomic operations tailored for specific subroutines. The inclusion of Tips and Shortcuts facilitates continuous refinement in performance and efficiency. Alongside this framework, we introduce Mobile-Eval-E, a new benchmark featuring complex mobile tasks requiring long-horizon, multi-app interactions. Empirical results show that Mobile-Agent-E achieves a 22% absolute improvement over previous state-of-the-art approaches across three foundation model backbones.

In this paper, we propose a novel audio-driven talking head method capable of simultaneously generating highly expressive facial expressions and hand gestures. Unlike existing methods that focus on generating full-body or half-body poses, we investigate the challenges of co-speech gesture generation and identify the weak correspondence between audio features and full-body gestures as a key limitation. To address this, we redefine the task as a two-stage process. In the first stage, we generate hand poses directly from audio input, leveraging the strong correlation between audio signals and hand movements. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion model to synthesize video frames, incorporating the hand poses generated in the first stage to produce realistic facial expressions and body movements. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, such as CyberHost and Vlogger, in terms of both visual quality and synchronization accuracy. This work provides a new perspective on audio-driven gesture generation and a robust framework for creating expressive and natural talking head animations.

We present Hunyuan3D 2.0, an advanced large-scale 3D synthesis system for generating high-resolution textured 3D assets. This system includes two foundation components: a large-scale shape generation model -- Hunyuan3D-DiT, and a large-scale texture synthesis model -- Hunyuan3D-Paint. The shape generative model, built on a scalable flow-based diffusion transformer, aims to create geometry that properly aligns with a given condition image, laying a solid foundation for downstream applications. The texture synthesis model, benefiting from strong geometric and diffusion priors, produces high-resolution and vibrant texture maps for either generated or hand-crafted meshes. Furthermore, we build Hunyuan3D-Studio -- a versatile, user-friendly production platform that simplifies the re-creation process of 3D assets. It allows both professional and amateur users to manipulate or even animate their meshes efficiently. We systematically evaluate our models, showing that Hunyuan3D 2.0 outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including the open-source models and closed-source models in geometry details, condition alignment, texture quality, and etc. Hunyuan3D 2.0 is publicly released in order to fill the gaps in the open-source 3D community for large-scale foundation generative models.

Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance human capabilities, assisting with digital tasks from sending emails to performing data analysis. The abilities of existing LLMs at such tasks are often hindered by the lack of high-quality agent data from the corresponding environments they interact with. We propose Learn-by-interact, a data-centric framework to adapt LLM agents to any given environments without human annotations. Learn-by-interact synthesizes trajectories of agent-environment interactions based on documentations, and constructs instructions by summarizing or abstracting the interaction histories, a process called backward construction. We assess the quality of our synthetic data by using them in both training-based scenarios and training-free in-context learning (ICL), where we craft innovative retrieval approaches optimized for agents. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench, WebArena, OSWorld and Spider2-V spanning across realistic coding, web, and desktop environments show the effectiveness of Learn-by-interact in various downstream agentic tasks -- baseline results are improved by up to 12.2\% for ICL with Claude-3.5 and 19.5\% for training with Codestral-22B. We further demonstrate the critical role of backward construction, which provides up to 14.0\% improvement for training. Our ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency provided by our synthesized data in ICL and the superiority of our retrieval pipeline over alternative approaches like conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We expect that Learn-by-interact will serve as a foundation for agent data synthesis as LLMs are increasingly deployed at real-world environments.

"Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance human capabilities, assisting with digital tasks from sending emails to performing data analysis. The abilities of existing LLMs at such tasks are often hindered by the lack of high-quality agent data from the corresponding environments they interact with. We propose Learn-by-interact, a data-centric framework to adapt LLM agents to any given environments without human annotations. Learn-by-interact synthesizes trajectories of agent-environment interactions based on documentations, and constructs instructions by summarizing or abstracting the interaction histories, a process called backward construction. We assess the quality of our synthetic data by using them in both training-based scenarios and training-free in-context learning (ICL), where we craft innovative retrieval approaches optimized for agents. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench, WebArena, OSWorld and Spider2-V spanning across realistic coding, web, and desktop environments show the effectiveness of Learn-by-interact in various downstream agentic tasks -- baseline results are improved by up to 12.2\% for ICL with Claude-3.5 and 19.5\% for training with Codestral-22B. We further demonstrate the critical role of backward construction, which provides up to 14.0\% improvement for training. Our ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency provided by our synthesized data in ICL and the superiority of our retrieval pipeline over alternative approaches like conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We expect that Learn-by-interact will serve as a foundation for agent data synthesis as LLMs are increasingly deployed at real-world environments."

Generative modeling aims to transform random noise into structured outputs. In this work, we enhance video diffusion models by allowing motion control via structured latent noise sampling. This is achieved by just a change in data: we pre-process training videos to yield structured noise. Consequently, our method is agnostic to diffusion model design, requiring no changes to model architectures or training pipelines. Specifically, we propose a novel noise warping algorithm, fast enough to run in real time, that replaces random temporal Gaussianity with correlated warped noise derived from optical flow fields, while preserving the spatial Gaussianity. The efficiency of our algorithm enables us to fine-tune modern video diffusion base models using warped noise with minimal overhead, and provide a one-stop solution for a wide range of user-friendly motion control: local object motion control, global camera movement control, and motion transfer. The harmonization between temporal coherence and spatial Gaussianity in our warped noise leads to effective motion control while maintaining per-frame pixel quality. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the advantages of our method, making it a robust and scalable approach for controlling motion in video diffusion models. Video results are available on our webpage: https://vgenai-netflix-eyeline-research.github.io/Go-with-the-Flow.

Depth Anything has achieved remarkable success in monocular depth estimation with strong generalization ability. However, it suffers from temporal inconsistency in videos, hindering its practical applications. Various methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue by leveraging video generation models or introducing priors from optical flow and camera poses. Nonetheless, these methods are only applicable to short videos (< 10 seconds) and require a trade-off between quality and computational efficiency. We propose Video Depth Anything for high-quality, consistent depth estimation in super-long videos (over several minutes) without sacrificing efficiency. We base our model on Depth Anything V2 and replace its head with an efficient spatial-temporal head. We design a straightforward yet effective temporal consistency loss by constraining the temporal depth gradient, eliminating the need for additional geometric priors. The model is trained on a joint dataset of video depth and unlabeled images, similar to Depth Anything V2. Moreover, a novel key-frame-based strategy is developed for long video inference. Experiments show that our model can be applied to arbitrarily long videos without compromising quality, consistency, or generalization ability. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot video depth estimation. We offer models of different scales to support a range of scenarios, with our smallest model capable of real-time performance at 30 FPS.
