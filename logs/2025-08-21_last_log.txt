Introduction We introduce NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 2, hybrid Mamba-Transformer reasoning model (Waleffe et al., 2024; Lieber et al., 2024; DeepMind, 2025; NVIDIA, 2025) that achieves on-par or better benchmark accuracies at 36 higher throughput than Qwen3-8B (Yang et al., 2025) for generationheavy scenarios like 1k input / 8k output or 8k input / 16k output tokens (Figure 1). Nemotron Nano 2 builds on the architecture of Nemotron-H (NVIDIA, 2025), but utilizes key new datasets and recipes for pre-training, alignment, pruning and distillation. We share these recipes, the checkpoints, as well as the majority of the preand post-training datasets. The initial base model, Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, was pre-trained using FP8 precision (2.4) over 20 trillion tokens using Warmup-Stable-Decay (Hu et al., 2024) learning rate schedule (2.5). It then underwent continuous pre-training long-context extension phase to become 128k-capable without degrading other benchmarks (2.6). Overall, new and improved datasets led to significant accuracy improvements over Nemotron-H-8B on math, multilingual, MMLU-Pro and other benchmarks (2.2). Nemotron Nano 2 was then post-trained through combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Christiano et al., 2017). We applied multiple SFT stages across various domains, followed by targeted SFT on key areas such as tool use, long-context performance, and truncated (budgeted) training. GRPO and RLHF sharpened instruction-following and conversational ability, while additional DPO stages further strengthened tool use. Overall, post-training was performed on roughly 90 billion tokens, the majority in single-turn promptresponse format with reasoning 2025 NVIDIA. All rights reserved. NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 2: An Accurate and Efficient Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Reasoning Model Figure 1 Comparison of Nemotron Nano 2 and Qwen3-8B in terms of accuracy and throughput. Nemotron Nano 2 achieves comparable or better accuracies on complex reasoning benchmarks, while achieving up to 6.3 higher throughput for such workloads. We abbreviate input sequence length to ISL and output sequence length to OSL and measure throughput on single A10G GPU in bfloat16. traces. About 5% of the data contained deliberately truncated reasoning traces, enabling fine-grained thinking budget control at inference time (3.4). Finally, both the base model and aligned model were compressed so as to enable inference over context lengths of 128k tokens on single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22 GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision). This was done by extending compression strategy based on Minitron (Muralidharan et al., 2024; Sreenivas et al., 2024; Taghibakhshi et al., 2025) to compress reasoning models subject to constraints. We are releasing the following models on Hugging Face: NVIDIA-Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2: the aligned and pruned reasoning model, NVIDIA-Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base: pruned base model, NVIDIA-Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base: the base model before alignment or pruning. Additionally, we are releasing the majority of our pre-training dataset in the Nemotron-PreTraining-Dataset-v1 collection of more than 6 trillion tokens: Nemotron-CC-v2: Follow-up to Nemotron-CC (Su et al., 2025) with eight additional Common Crawl snapshots (20242025), synthetic rephrasing, deduplication, and synthetic Q&A data translated into 15 languages. Nemotron-CC-Math-v1: 133B-token math dataset from Common Crawl using Lynx + LLM pipeline (Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2025a). Preserves equations, standardizes to LaTeX, outperforms previous math datasets on benchmarks. Nemotron-Pretraining-Code-v1: Curated GitHub code references with multi-stage filtering, deduplication, and quality filters. Includes code Q&A data in 11 programming languages. Nemotron-Pretraining-SFT-v1: Synthetic SFT-style dataset covering STEM, multilingual, academic, and reasoning domains.

A deep equilibrium canonicalizer (DEC) enhances local scale equivariance in deep networks, improving performance and consistency on ImageNet.  					AI-generated summary 				 Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our code is available at https://github.com/ashiq24/local-scale-equivariance.

"A deep equilibrium canonicalizer (DEC) enhances local scale equivariance in deep networks, improving performance and consistency on ImageNet.  					AI-generated summary 				 Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our code is available at https://github.com/ashiq24/local-scale-equivariance."
