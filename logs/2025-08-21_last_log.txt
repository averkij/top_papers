[ 1 4 0 7 4 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r a2025-08-21 MCP-Universe: Benchmarking Large Language Models with MCP-Universe Real-World Model Context Protocol Servers Ziyang Luo Zhiqi Shen Wenzhuo Yang Zirui Zhaohttps://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/MCP-Universe (cid:128) https://mcp-universe.github.ioThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as transformative standard for connecting large language models (LLMs) to external data sources and tools, rapidly gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However, existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6 core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement executionbased evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static evaluators for timeinvariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks. Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even top-performing models such as GPT-5 (43.72% success rate), Grok-4 (33.33% success rate) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44% success rate) exhibit significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it introduces an unknowntools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks. Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem.The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic [1], represents major paradigm shift in how AI systems interface with external data sources and tools. Dubbed the USB-C of AI[2], MCP addresses the long-standing issue of fragmented, bespoke integrations that trap language models in isolated information silos[3]. Since its release, MCP has gained rapid traction: major AI providers, including OpenAI [4] and Google Gemini [5], have committed to adoption, while development platforms such as Cursor [6] and Cline [7] have begun integrating it to enhance their products. Despite the transformative potential of MCPs, current evaluations remain insufficient for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs operating within this new paradigm. Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on isolated aspects of LLM performance, such as instruction following [8], math reasoning [9], or function calling [10], without providing comprehensive assessment of how models interact with real-world MCP servers across diverse scenarios. Recently, MCP-RADAR [11] adapts existing benchmarks such as HumanEval [12] and GSM8k [9] to the MCP context. However, these adaptations are largely derivative of existing datasets, which neither capture the full breadth of real-world applications nor adequately address issues such as data leakage. MCPWorld [13], another recently proposed benchmark, continues to rely heavily on graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and exhibits insufficient coverage of MCP-enabled workflows, thereby limiting its utility for evaluating LLMs in real MCP-driven environments. To address these critical limitations, we introduce our MCP-Universe, benchmark aiming at evaluating LLMs in realistic, challenging use cases with real-world MCP servers. As shown in Figure 1, MCP-Universe captures realistic Equal Contributions.2025-08-21 Figure 1: Example from MCP-Universe illustrating realistic challenges, including real-world tool usage, long-horizon multi-turn tool calls, long context windows, scattered evidence, and large tool spaces. Unlike prior work, MCPUniverse is grounded in real-world MCP servers connected to actual data sources and environments. challenges: real-world tools usage, long-horizon multi-turn tool calls, long context windows, scattered evidence, and large tool spaces. Unlike existing works, MCP-Universe is grounded in real-world MCP servers that connect to actual data sources and environments. Our benchmark encompasses 6 core domains, with 11 MCP servers spanning diverse applications: Location Navigation, Repository Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web Searching, comprising total of 231 tasks. Each domain captures the operational complexities of real-world deployments, from handling authentic financial data and navigating complex geospatial information to managing version control workflows and executing real-time ticket price checks. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we carefully design execution-based evaluators rather than relying on LLM-as-ajudge [14] (e.g., MCPEval [15] and LiveMCPBench [16]), recognizing that many tasks involve real-time data that static LLM knowledge cannot properly assess. Our evaluation includes format evaluators for agent format compliance, static evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that automatically obtain real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks. Furthermore, for the evolving nature of MCP servers, we provide an extensible, userfriendly framework that enables researchers and the broader community to seamlessly integrate new agents and MCP servers into the evaluation pipeline. Our benchmark is also equipped with UI for intuitive, user-friendly access. We conducted extensive experiments using MCP-Universe across all 6 core domains and 11 different MCP servers. Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even top-performing models such as GPT5 (43.72% success rate), Grok-4 (33.33% success rate), and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44% success rate) exhibit significant performance limitations, revealing substantial gap between their impressive general capabilities and their effectiveness in real-world MCP environments.

Text:"Leuvenshtein: Efficient FHE-based Edit Distance Computation with Single Bootstrap per Cell Wouter Legiest1, Jan-Pieter DAnvers1, Bojan Spasic2, Nam-Luc Tran2 and Ingrid Verbauwhede1 1 COSIC, KU Leuven firstname.lastname@esat.kuleuven.be 2 Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) Abstract. This paper presents novel approach to calculating the Levenshtein (edit) distance within the framework of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), specifically targeting third-generation schemes like TFHE. Edit distance computations are essential in applications across finance and genomics, such as DNA sequence alignment. We introduce an optimised algorithm that significantly reduces the cost of edit distance calculations called Leuvenshtein. This algorithm specifically reduces the number of programmable bootstraps (PBS) needed per cell of the calculation, lowering it from approximately 94 operations required by the conventional Wagner-Fisher algorithm to just 1. Additionally, we propose an efficient method for performing equality checks on characters, reducing ASCII character comparisons to only 2 PBS operations. Finally, we explore the potential for further performance improvements by utilising preprocessing when one of the input strings is unencrypted. Our Leuvenshtein achieves up to 278 faster performance compared to the best available TFHE implementation and up to 39 faster than an optimised implementation of the Wagner-Fisher algorithm. Moreover, when offline preprocessing is possible due to the presence of one unencrypted input on the server side, an additional 3 speedup can be achieved. The past 20 years have seen major evolution of the global financial system. Financial crises, geopolitical events and economic growth have deeply impacted the direction that banking regulations have taken. One of the major policy shifts is in the direction of increasing transparency and sharing information between financial institutions. For instance, the G20 set target"

MCP-Universe is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large language models in realistic tasks through interaction with real-world MCP servers, addressing challenges like long-horizon reasoning and unfamiliar tool spaces.  					AI-generated summary 				 The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However, existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6 core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks. Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks. Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem.

An optimized algorithm reduces the computational cost of edit distance calculations within Fully Homomorphic Encryption, achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents a novel approach to calculating the Levenshtein (edit) distance within the framework of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), specifically targeting third-generation schemes like TFHE. Edit distance computations are essential in applications across finance and genomics, such as DNA sequence alignment. We introduce an optimised algorithm that significantly reduces the cost of edit distance calculations called Leuvenshtein. This algorithm specifically reduces the number of programmable bootstraps (PBS) needed per cell of the calculation, lowering it from approximately 94 operations -- required by the conventional Wagner-Fisher algorithm -- to just 1. Additionally, we propose an efficient method for performing equality checks on characters, reducing ASCII character comparisons to only 2 PBS operations. Finally, we explore the potential for further performance improvements by utilising preprocessing when one of the input strings is unencrypted. Our Leuvenshtein achieves up to 278times faster performance compared to the best available TFHE implementation and up to 39times faster than an optimised implementation of the Wagner-Fisher algorithm. Moreover, when offline preprocessing is possible due to the presence of one unencrypted input on the server side, an additional 3times speedup can be achieved.
