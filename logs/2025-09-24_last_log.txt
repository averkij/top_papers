Furthermore, they also show advantages in data efficiency and cross-embodiment adaptation, enhancing their practicality for real-world deployment. I. INTRODUCTION Imitation-learning-based visuomotor policies [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] have been widely used in robotic manipulation. Leveraging large-scale demonstration datasets [6, 7, 8, 9] and fine-tuning powerful pre-trained policies have enabled robots to achieve remarkable performance across diverse real-world tasks. For precise and reliable control, these visuomotor policies typically incorporate not only visual observations of the task environment but also proprioceptive state (hereafter referred to as state) inputs [3, 10, 11], such as end-effector poses and joint angles. The state inputs provide compact and the robots configuration, but accurate information about they also make the policy prone to overfitting by simply memorizing the training trajectories. Therefore it severely limits spatial generalization [12, 13, 14] if the training data lacks diversity [15]. In todays context, where collecting demonstration data with wide state coverage (i.e., diverse locations of task-relevant objects) is prohibitively spatial expensive, this has become critical bottleneck for the development of visuomotor policies. In this study, we propose to completely remove the state input in visuomotor policies to enhance their spatial generalization ability, hereafter referred to as State-free Policies. This design is built upon two conditions: Equal Contribution. This work was done during the internship at Spirit AI. Corresponding authors. Project leader. 1Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2Spirit AI, 3Tsinghua University, 4New York University Shanghai, 5Tongji University. Fig. 1: With relative EEF action space and full task observation, State-free Policies demonstrate significantly improved spatial generalization ability compared to state-based policies. To handle complex scenarios, the full task observation is implemented by dual wide-angle wrist-cameras. Relative end-effector (EEF) action space [16]: The visuomotor policies predict relative displacements of the end-effector based on the current observation. Among different action spaces, the relative EEF action space most naturally supports the generalization of policies. Full task observation: Another key condition for effective State-free Policies is to ensure sufficient taskrelevant visual information, which we term full task observation. This enables visuomotor policies to fully see the task-relevant objects in the task. As shown in Figure 1, under the relative EEF action space, we ensure full task observation with dual wide-angle wristcameras (field of view approximately 120 120) mounted on the top and bottom of the end-effector, which provides sufficient task-relevant visual information for State-free Policies even in some complex scenarios. This mechanism of State-free Policies forces the policy to develop deeper understanding of the task environment rather than simply memorizing the trajectories, thereby enabling State-free Policies to achieve advantages that statebased policies cannot provide: Spatial Generalization: Since State-free Policies do not rely on state inputs, they avoid overfitting to the training trajectories. Therefore, they exhibit strong height and horizontal generalization abilities, where height refers to variations of the task-relevant objects location in the vertical direction, and horizontal refers to variations of the objects location in the 2D plane. Data efficiency: Even in in-domain settings, state-based policies require diverse demonstrations to avoid overfitting to specific trajectories. In contrast, removing the state input eliminates this dependence on trajectory diversity, allowing State-free Policies to be fine-tuned with less demonstration data. This reduces the cost of data collection, which is often major bottleneck in deploying real-world robots. with limited gains [14]. While such methods can be effective, they introduce additional cost or require non-trivial algorithmic design, highlighting the need for simpler and more practical solution to spatial generalization. Cross-embodiment adaptation: Since State-free Policies rely only on visual inputs and predict actions in the relative EEF space, they exhibit stronger cross-embodiment adaptation ability than state-based policies. They do not require additional adaptation to different state spaces, so the same task can be easily adapted to new embodiments with fewer fine-tuning steps. We have conducted extensive experiments across diverse range of tasks, robot embodiments, and policy architectures. In both real-world and simulation environments, State-free Policies achieve comparably great in-domain performance to state-based policies. Most importantly, when trained on strictly collected real-world demonstration data (i.e., the taskrelevant object location has constrained initial distribution range), State-free Policies exhibit significantly stronger spatial generalization"

However, the amount of available robotics data in the wild is growing exponentially, creating new opportunities for large-scale data utilization. Reliable temporal task completion prediction could help automatically annotate and curate this data at scale. The Generative Value Learning (GVL) approach was recently proposed, leveraging the knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) to predict task progress from visual observations. Building upon GVL, we propose OpenGVL, comprehensive benchmark for estimating task progress across diverse challenging manipulation tasks involving both robotic and human embodiments. We evaluate the capabilities of publicly available opensource foundation models, showing that open-source model families significantly underperform closed-source counterparts, achieving only approximately 70% of their performance on temporal progress prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate how OpenGVL can serve as practical tool for automated data curation and filtering, enabling efficient quality assessment of large-scale robotics datasets. We release the benchmark along with the complete codebase at OpenGVL. Advancements in hardware and modeling have accelerated progress in robotics. Various embodiments have recently been proposed with decreasing bill-of-material costs, leading to wider availability [1, 2, 3]. variety of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are being created and opensourced [4, 5, 6].

While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced document understanding for high-resource languages, their performance on Arabic remains limited. In this work, we introduce Baseer, vision-language model finetuned specifically for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging large-scale dataset combining synthetic and real-world documents, Baseer is trained using decoder-only fine-tuning strategy to adapt pre-trained MLLM while preserving general visual features. We also present Misraj-DocOCR, high-quality, expert-verified benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of Arabic OCR systems. Our experiments show that Baseer significantly outperforms existing open-source and commercial solutions, achieving WER of 0.25 and establishing new state-of-the-art in the domain of Arabic document OCR. Our results highlight the benefits of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs and establish strong baseline for high-accuracy OCR on morphologically rich languages like Arabic. The recent and rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have fundamentally reshaped the landscape of how machines perceive and process complex visual and textual data Hurst et al. [2024]; Comanici et al. [2025]; Zhu et al. [2025]; Bai et al. [2025].

A state-free policy using only visual observations achieves better spatial generalization and data efficiency in robot manipulation tasks compared to state-based policies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Imitation-learning-based visuomotor policies have been widely used in robot manipulation, where both visual observations and proprioceptive states are typically adopted together for precise control. However, in this study, we find that this common practice makes the policy overly reliant on the proprioceptive state input, which causes overfitting to the training trajectories and results in poor spatial generalization. On the contrary, we propose the State-free Policy, removing the proprioceptive state input and predicting actions only conditioned on visual observations. The State-free Policy is built in the relative end-effector action space, and should ensure the full task-relevant visual observations, here provided by dual wide-angle wrist cameras. Empirical results demonstrate that the State-free policy achieves significantly stronger spatial generalization than the state-based policy: in real-world tasks such as pick-and-place, challenging shirt-folding, and complex whole-body manipulation, spanning multiple robot embodiments, the average success rate improves from 0\% to 85\% in height generalization and from 6\% to 64\% in horizontal generalization. Furthermore, they also show advantages in data efficiency and cross-embodiment adaptation, enhancing their practicality for real-world deployment.

OpenGVL is a benchmark for task progress prediction in robotics using vision-language models, showing open-source models underperform compared to closed-source ones and enabling automated data curation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Data scarcity remains one of the most limiting factors in driving progress in robotics. However, the amount of available robotics data in the wild is growing exponentially, creating new opportunities for large-scale data utilization. Reliable temporal task completion prediction could help automatically annotate and curate this data at scale. The Generative Value Learning (GVL) approach was recently proposed, leveraging the knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) to predict task progress from visual observations. Building upon GVL, we propose OpenGVL, a comprehensive benchmark for estimating task progress across diverse challenging manipulation tasks involving both robotic and human embodiments. We evaluate the capabilities of publicly available open-source foundation models, showing that open-source model families significantly underperform closed-source counterparts, achieving only approximately 70% of their performance on temporal progress prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate how OpenGVL can serve as a practical tool for automated data curation and filtering, enabling efficient quality assessment of large-scale robotics datasets. We release the benchmark along with the complete codebase at github.com/budzianowski/opengvl{OpenGVL}.

Baseer, a vision-language model fine-tuned for Arabic document OCR, achieves state-of-the-art performance using a decoder-only strategy and a large-scale dataset, outperforming existing solutions with a WER of 0.25.  					AI-generated summary 				 Arabic document OCR remains a challenging task due to the language's cursive script, diverse fonts, diacritics, and right-to-left orientation. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced document understanding for high-resource languages, their performance on Arabic remains limited. In this work, we introduce Baseer, a vision-language model fine- tuned specifically for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging a large-scale dataset combining synthetic and real-world documents, Baseer is trained using a decoder-only fine-tuning strategy to adapt a pre-trained MLLM while preserving general visual features. We also present Misraj-DocOCR, a high-quality, expert-verified benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of Arabic OCR systems. Our experiments show that Baseer significantly outperforms existing open-source and commercial solutions, achieving a WER of 0.25 and establishing a new state-of-the-art in the domain of Arabic document OCR. Our results highlight the benefits of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs and establish a strong baseline for high-accuracy OCR on morphologically rich languages like Arabic.

"Baseer, a vision-language model fine-tuned for Arabic document OCR, achieves state-of-the-art performance using a decoder-only strategy and a large-scale dataset, outperforming existing solutions with a WER of 0.25.  					AI-generated summary 				 Arabic document OCR remains a challenging task due to the language's cursive script, diverse fonts, diacritics, and right-to-left orientation. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced document understanding for high-resource languages, their performance on Arabic remains limited. In this work, we introduce Baseer, a vision-language model fine- tuned specifically for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging a large-scale dataset combining synthetic and real-world documents, Baseer is trained using a decoder-only fine-tuning strategy to adapt a pre-trained MLLM while preserving general visual features. We also present Misraj-DocOCR, a high-quality, expert-verified benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of Arabic OCR systems. Our experiments show that Baseer significantly outperforms existing open-source and commercial solutions, achieving a WER of 0.25 and establishing a new state-of-the-art in the domain of Arabic document OCR. Our results highlight the benefits of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs and establish a strong baseline for high-accuracy OCR on morphologically rich languages like Arabic."
