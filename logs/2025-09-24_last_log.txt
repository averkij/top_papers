Revisiting Length, Review, and Structure of CoT Yunzhen Feng1,2,, Julia Kempe1,2,, Cheng Zhang1,, Parag Jain1,, Anthony Hartshorn1, 1Meta Superintelligence Labs, 2New York University Work done during an internship at Meta, Joint advising Large reasoning models (LRMs) spend substantial test-time compute on long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, but what characterizes an effective CoT remains unclear. While prior work reports gains from lengthening CoTs and increasing review (revisiting earlier steps) via appended wait tokens, recent studies suggest that shorter thinking can outperform longer traces. We therefore conduct systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and scientific reasoning. Contrary to the longer-is-better narrative, we find that both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with lower accuracy. As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with process quality. We introduce graph view of CoT to extract structure and identify single statisticthe Failed-Step Fraction (FSF), the fraction of steps in abandoned branchesthat consistently outpredicts length and review ratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two interventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where FSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed branches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed branches bias subsequent reasoning. Taken together, these results characterize effective CoTs as those that fail less and support structure-aware test-time scaling over indiscriminately generating long CoT.

However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, unified acceleration framework designed to simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our approach uses divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for next-token prediction and multi-stage distillation process for diffusion denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting lossless 6-NFE model yields 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and 22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of the original model. We further develop highly efficient 1-NFE model that enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous. Correspondence: xiaoxuefeng.ailab@bytedance.com Project Page: https://hyper-bagel.github.io/The field of unified multimodal models has recently attracted considerable attention for their remarkable abilities in jointly understanding and generating diverse content, marking promising leap forward in nextgeneration Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) paradigms [1, 6, 7, 17, 21, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45, 55]. While prior scaling approaches predominantly relied on standard image-text pairs, the innovative training paradigm incorporating interleaved sequences from BAGEL [6] has achieved notable successes, outperforming models specialized solely in understanding or generation across multiple benchmarks. However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising [12, 24] and autoregressive decoding [1, 3] for next-token prediction impose significant computational overhead. To address this, carefully engineered acceleration framework is crucial, one that delivers lossless speedups for both tasks simultaneously, thereby maintaining seamless knowledge transfer between understanding and generation modalities. 1 Figure 1 Image generation samples produced by our 6-NFE accelerated BAGEL model. 2 Figure 2 Image editing samples produced by our 6-NFE accelerated BAGEL model. To realize this vision, we adopt divide-and-conquer strategy and validate it on BAGEL. For next-token prediction, we employ speculative decoding [4, 15, 18, 20] by training lightweight draft model with fewer parameters and lower computational requirements. This draft model iteratively predicts multiple consecutive tokens, with the speculative output then batch-validated by the target model in parallel. This approach preserves the understanding capabilities of target model intact, converting its memory access bottleneck during autoregressive decoding into computational one, resulting in over 2x speedup. For diffusion denoising, we develop multi-stage distillation process that decomposes objectives into three key dimensions to reduce sampling steps, i.e. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) [11] control, structural integrity, and image fidelity, each optimized with tailored algorithms. We successfully constrain sampling steps for text-to-image generation and image editing to within 6-NFE (Number of Function Evaluations), yielding speedups of 16.67x and 22x, respectively, while maintaining equivalent performance on GenEval [9] and GEdit-Bench [27] metrics compared to the baseline model. See figures 1 and 2 for examples of image generation and editing via our 6-NFE model. In adopting speculative decoding, we primarily adhere to the EAGLE-3 [20] training paradigm. Our initial reproduction experiments reveal that straightforward application of EAGLE-3 underperformed on BAGEL. Notably, community reproductions on the latest Vision-Language Model (VLM) Qwen3 [47] achieved only 1.7x speedup in Tokens Per Second (TPS), diverging sharply from the 4-5x accelerations typically observed in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Vicuna [53], LLaMA [10], and DeepSeek [25]. We assume that this disparity stems from the complex interleaving of image and text tokens in multimodal sequences, where embedding spaces vary considerably. Therefore, the draft models limited capacity fails to adequately model these variations, resulting in substantial prediction accuracy losses. Furthermore, BAGEL presents even greater challenges than standard VLMs because it must handle not only text and ViT image tokens but also the clean latent tokens prefilled after diffusion denoising. To validate our hypothesis and resolve the issue, we design an efficient intermediate layer architecture that bridges the target and draft models, aggregating representations to facilitate the draft models consecutive predictions more effectively. This led to TPS improvement from baseline of 98.3 to approximately 212.4 in the SGLang [54] environment with chain decoding on single A100 GPU, resulting in 2.16x speedup. Regarding diffusion distillation [22, 23, 28, 34, 36], our primary objective is to preserve the models full capabilities, including both control and quality perspectives. The capability in control refers to the ability to adjust the degree of instruction adherence and consistency maintenance with the original image in the editing scenario by text and image guidance scales, which is typically enabled through CFG. Meanwhile, the quality of generated images can be assessed through two key dimensions, i.e. structural integrity and image fidelity, which are the most easily perceived factors during human preference evaluation. Building on this foundation, we carried out distillation over three stages tailored for each capability. The first stage focuses on CFG distillation, which aims to embed the text and image guidance scales alongside timesteps into singl"

However, their training and inference efficiency have emerged as core bottleneck in making MLLMs more accessible and scalable. To address the challenges, we present MiniCPM-V 4.5, an 8B parameter model designed for high efficiency and strong performance. We introduce three core improvements in model architecture, data strategy and training method: unified 3D-Resampler model architecture for highly compact encoding over images and videos, unified learning paradigm for document knowledge and text recognition without heavy data engineering, and hybrid reinforcement learning strategy for proficiency in both short and long reasoning modes. Comprehensive experimental results in OpenCompass evaluation show that MiniCPM-V 4.5 surpasses widely used proprietary models such as GPT-4o-latest, and significantly larger open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL 72B. Notably, the strong performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency. For example, on the widely adopted VideoMME benchmark, MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models under 30B size, using just 46.7% GPU memory cost and 8.7% inference time of Qwen2.5-VL 7B.Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] are advancing rapidly the frontier of artificial intelligence, enabling machines to deeply understand and reason over different modalities such as text and images. However, as MLLMs evolve, the cost of data engineering, training, and inference also increases heavily. Addressing this efficiency challenge is now central focus of both research and industry [6, 8, 9, 10, 11], essential for making capable MLLMs more accessible and scalable. We decompose this efficiency problem into three core aspects: (1) Model Architecture. primary efficiency bottleneck in MLLMs comes from the large number of visual tokens for high-resolution image encoding, which brings heavy computation overhead for visual encoders and LLMs. The problem is even exacerbated in video understanding, where existing models can take thousands of Corresponding authors. tokens to encode short and low-resolution video, even when sampling at low frame rate. For example, processing 6-second, 2-fps video at resolution of just 448448 requires 1,536 tokens for Qwen2.5-VL [7], and 3,072 tokens for InternVL3 [9]. Such long visual token sequences lead to prohibitive training and inference costs in GPU memory and computation speed. (2) Training Data. As we quickly run out of new knowledge from traditional web page data, new cornerstone of modern MLLMs is harnessing high-quality multimodal knowledge from documents [1, 2], such as scientific papers and textbooks. These documents are often stored as PDFs, containing multi-disciplinary knowledge in various domains and organized in diverse layouts of interleaved texts, images, and tables. However, most methods depend on brittle external parsing tools to convert document files into interleaved image-text sequences for training. These tools often fail in complex layouts, leading to either errors in knowledge learning or heavy data engineering efforts to fix the failure cases. (3) Training Methods. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in improving complex reasoning capabilities by enabling step-by-step explicit thinking process before providing the final answer [12, 1]. However, this performance gain often comes at the expense of extreme verbosity. Even for simple tasks such as identifying obvious objects, most existing thinking models produce excessively long outputs, inducing poor efficiency in both training and inference. For example, on the comprehensive Opencompass benchmark, the hybrid strategy requires only 33.3% long reasoning samples to match the peak long reasoning performance of training exclusively in single mode. To address the challenges, MiniCPM-V 4.5 introduces three key improvements in model architecture, data strategy, and training method: (1) Unified 3D-Resampler for Compact Image and Video Encoding. Previous MiniCPM-V series models [6] exhibit high compression rates (e.g., 4 compared with most MLLMs) for high-resolution images via 2D-Resamplers [5, 13]. To further address the architectural inefficiency of video processing, we extend the 2D-Resampler to 3D-Resampler that jointly compresses spatial-temporal information for videos. This module can encode 6-second, 2-fps, 448448 resolution video into only 128 visual tokens, achieving 12-24 reduction in token cost compared to representative MLLMs [7, 9], enabling efficient high frame rate and long video understanding, and unified encoding for images as well. (2) Unified Learning Paradigm for Document Knowledge and OCR. We propose learning paradigm that enables the model to accurately acquire knowledge directly from document images, eliminating the need for fragile external parsers. By dynamically corrupting text regions in documents with varying noise levels and asking the model to reconstruct the text, the model learns to adaptively and properly switch between accurate text recognition (when text is roughly visible) and multimodal context-based knowledge reasoning (when text is heavily corrupted). (3) Hybrid Strategy for Post-Training. Unlike prior models that optimize for single long reasoning mode [2, 1], we develop hybrid RL post-training strategy to support both short reasoning mode for efficient usage and long reasoning mode for complex tasks. In RL training, we randomly alternate between the two modes during the rollout process for joint optimization. This approach not only enables flexible control over the short and long reasoning modes but also allows for mutual performance enhancement. In experiments, we can achieve better reasoning performance with fewer training samples for both modes. Comprehensive experimental "

A self-distillation framework converts implicit 3D knowledge from video diffusion models into an explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting representation, enabling 3D scene generation from text or images.  					AI-generated summary 				 The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications ranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.

Effective chain-of-thoughts in large reasoning models are characterized by fewer failed steps and better structural quality, not necessarily by length or review.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large reasoning models (LRMs) spend substantial test-time compute on long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, but what *characterizes* an effective CoT remains unclear. While prior work reports gains from lengthening CoTs and increasing review (revisiting earlier steps) via appended *wait* tokens, recent studies suggest that shorter thinking can outperform longer traces. We therefore conduct a systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and scientific reasoning. Contrary to the "longer-is-better" narrative, we find that both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with *lower* accuracy.   As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with process quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and identify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of steps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review ratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two interventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where FSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed branches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed branches bias subsequent reasoning. Taken together, these results characterize effective CoTs as those that *fail less* and support *structure-aware* test-time scaling over indiscriminately generating long CoT.

Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT) optimizes large language models by autonomously exploring meaningful trajectories in pre-training data, improving generalizable reasoning skills without human annotation.  					AI-generated summary 				 The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of 3.0, 5.1, 8.1, 6.0, 6.6, and 5.3 on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.

To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of 3.0, 5.1, 8.1, 6.0, 6.6, and 5.3 on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance."

A training-free method enables generalist multimodal models to process multi-spectral imagery in a zero-shot manner, enhancing performance on remote sensing tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing applications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and urban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional spectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such as ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification, and their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat, only adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is predominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for multi-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore, although providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs cannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are capable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand specialized multi-spectral signals.   To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new multi-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist multimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the multimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to inputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions into the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe strong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing benchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy adaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential for geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to easily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate their work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities, grounded in the specialized sensor data.

Hyper-Bagel accelerates multimodal understanding and generation tasks using speculative decoding and multi-stage distillation, achieving significant speedups while maintaining high-quality outputs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Unified multimodal models have recently attracted considerable attention for their remarkable abilities in jointly understanding and generating diverse content. However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a 22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.

MiniCPM-V 4.5, a 8B parameter multimodal large language model, achieves high performance and efficiency through a unified 3D-Resampler architecture, a unified learning paradigm, and a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are undergoing rapid progress and represent the frontier of AI development. However, their training and inference efficiency have emerged as a core bottleneck in making MLLMs more accessible and scalable. To address the challenges, we present MiniCPM-V 4.5, an 8B parameter model designed for high efficiency and strong performance. We introduce three core improvements in model architecture, data strategy and training method: a unified 3D-Resampler model architecture for highly compact encoding over images and videos, a unified learning paradigm for document knowledge and text recognition without heavy data engineering, and a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy for proficiency in both short and long reasoning modes. Comprehensive experimental results in OpenCompass evaluation show that MiniCPM-V 4.5 surpasses widely used proprietary models such as GPT-4o-latest, and significantly larger open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL 72B. Notably, the strong performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency. For example, on the widely adopted VideoMME benchmark, MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models under 30B size, using just 46.7\% GPU memory cost and 8.7\% inference time of Qwen2.5-VL 7B.

"MiniCPM-V 4.5, a 8B parameter multimodal large language model, achieves high performance and efficiency through a unified 3D-Resampler architecture, a unified learning paradigm, and a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are undergoing rapid progress and represent the frontier of AI development. However, their training and inference efficiency have emerged as a core bottleneck in making MLLMs more accessible and scalable. To address the challenges, we present MiniCPM-V 4.5, an 8B parameter model designed for high efficiency and strong performance. We introduce three core improvements in model architecture, data strategy and training method: a unified 3D-Resampler model architecture for highly compact encoding over images and videos, a unified learning paradigm for document knowledge and text recognition without heavy data engineering, and a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy for proficiency in both short and long reasoning modes. Comprehensive experimental results in OpenCompass evaluation show that MiniCPM-V 4.5 surpasses widely used proprietary models such as GPT-4o-latest, and significantly larger open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL 72B. Notably, the strong performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency. For example, on the widely adopted VideoMME benchmark, MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models under 30B size, using just 46.7\% GPU memory cost and 8.7\% inference time of Qwen2.5-VL 7B."
