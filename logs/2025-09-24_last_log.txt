Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens. This is the first work introducing scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use soft tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the soft models can be deployed in standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing softer touch to the base model.

Text:"COMMONFORMS: Large, Diverse Dataset for Form Field Detection Joe Barrow Independent Researcher joseph.d.barrow@gmail.com 5 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 6 0 5 6 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r aThis paper introduces CommonForms, web-scale dataset for form field detection. It casts the problem of form field detection as object detection: given an image of page, predict the location and type (Text Input, Choice Button, Signature) of form fields. The dataset is constructed by filtering Common Crawl to find PDFs that have fillable elements. Starting with 8 million documents, the filtering process is used to arrive at final dataset of roughly 55k documents that have more than 450k pages. Analysis shows that the dataset contains diverse mixture of languages and domains; one third of the pages are nonEnglish, and among the 14 classified domains, no domain makes up more than 25% of the dataset. In addition, this paper presents family of form field detectors, FFDNet-Small and FFDNet-Large, which attain very high average precision on the CommonForms test set. Each model cost less than $500 to train. Ablation results show that high-resolution inputs are crucial for highquality form field detection, and that the cleaning process improves data efficiency over using all PDFs that have fillable fields in Common Crawl. qualitative analysis shows that they outperform popular and commercially available PDF reader that can prepare forms. Unlike the most popular commercially available solutions, FFDNet can predict checkboxes in addition to text and signature fields. This is, to our knowledge, the first large-scale dataset released for form field detection, as well as the first open-source models. The dataset, models, and code will be released at https://github.com/jbarrow/commonforms. 1. Introduction Despite decades of digitalization, large volume of realworld transactions still center around paper forms: insurance claims, municipal paperwork, school permission slips, and many, many others. These documents are often distributed as scans or non-fillable (flat) PDFs, and require either printing, tedious software workarounds, or turning to proprietary solution like Adobe Acrobat or Apple Preview. In order to be digitally filled, flat form must be prepared by having interactive form fields inserted. Although proprietary solutions may employ machine learning to prepare forms, there is not yet high-quality open-source machine learning-based system that can automatically and reliably prepare fillable forms. Converting flat PDF to an accessible form one that can be understood by screen reader, or filled automatically typically requires two steps: 1. form field detection: detecting the locations and types (e.g. text or checkbox) of fillable elements; and 2. form enrichment: grouping the fillable elements and their labels based on the semantics of the form. Previous work has primarily focused on the second [1, 2]. In this work, we tackle the first problem by detecting where the fillable elements should go visually in PDF. To this end, we construct and release both large-scale dataset, COMMONFORMS, consisting of more than 480k pages from more than 59k document forms. We also train and release family of form field detection models trained on this dataset, FFDNet-Small and FFDNetLarge. Training each of these models costs roughly $500 of compute or less, and yet these models are capable of highquality form field detection. They achieve high average precision of more than 80 on the COMMONFORMS test set. We perform qualitative analysis of these models against Adobe Acrobat and show that FFDNet has better recall and precision than Acrobat. COMMONFORMS is drawn from large collection of interactive PDF forms scraped from the Internet. The core insight of this paper is that quantity has quality all its own, and that we can leverage existing fillable forms as training signal. We use Common Crawl as wellspring of PDFs and apply rigorous cleaning process. This cleaning process results in improved data efficiency compared to using every PDF with form field. To train the FFDNet family of models, we cast the problem of form field detection as pure object detection problem. Given page image, the goal is to predict the location and types of each form element. The types are drawn from teh following set: {Choice Button, Text Figure 1. Overview of form field detection and preparation. Input, Signature}. This means that, unlike Adobe Acrobat and Apple Preview, FFDNet can predict the location of choice buttons (i.e. checkboxes and radio buttons). As of the time of publication, these tools only predict text form fields. The FFDNet models are high-resolution (1216px) YOLO11 [11] object detectors. Our ablation results show that high-resolution inputs are crucial to quality; models trained on 10k pages at varying resolutions show range of roughly 20 mean average precision points. Our contributions are as follows: we prepare release COMMONFORMS, large, diverse, and high quality dataset for form field detection; we train and release family of form field detection models on COMMONFORMS, FFDNet-Small and FFDNet-Large1; we provide an in depth analysis of COMMONFORMS to identify the represented languages and domains; and we compare the FFDNet models against the most popular commercial system, Adobe Acrobat, and show that they produce substantially higher quality forms. 2. Related Work Machine-learning-based work on document forms can be viewed as two broad categories: form preparation and form understanding. Form preparation is the task of making form fillable, whether that is detecting widgets or building semantic model of the form. Form understanding, also 1supported by LambdaLabs compute grant known as key information extraction (KIE), is an information extraction task on filled-out document forms. This paper is an instance of form preparation, which is the smaller of the two subfields. Form Preparation and Understanding Representative work on form preparation includes the line of work on Form2Seq [1, 2] and FormA11y [18]. Form2Seq formalizes semantic form model, treating it as joint classification and grouping task. Lower-level elements like widgets and text blocks are first classified into, e.g. ChoiceButton or TextField, and then grouped into higher-order categories like ChoiceGroup. However, it is assumed that the interactive form widgets have already been correctly detected. FormA11y takes human-in-the-loop approach in which users match labels to widgets to c"

By letting VLMs absorb semantic and visual complexity, PEEK equips manipulation policies with the minimal cues they needwhere, what, and how. Website at https://peek-robot.github.io. I. INTRODUCTION Imagine walking through crowded store when your child suddenly cries out, want the Labubu! Though youve never heard the word before, context clues guide your eyes to the fuzzy toy on the shelf, and you effortlessly weave through the crowd to grab it. What makes this possible is not raw perception ability, but the ability to interpret ambiguous instructions and distill them into just the right cueswhere to focus, what actions to take, and how to perform these actions at the low level. Similarly, if given where to focus and what motions to take, robot manipulation policy should be able to achieve the visual robustness and semantic generalization necessary for open-world deployment by focusing only on how to perform actions.training manipulation policies is through imitation learning of human-collected robotics data [1][4], which attempts to learn the where, what, and how all at the same time. Yet their performance degrades on novel objects, clutter, or semantic variations [5], [6], since the policy alone bears the burden of handling task, semantic, and visual complexity. Such failures often entangle the axes of where, what, and howfor example, grasping distractor simultaneously reflects misplaced attention, an incorrect object choice, and wrong motion. Co-first authors, Equal Advising, 1University of Washington, 2NVIDIA, 3University of Southern California, 4Allen Institute for AI Fig. 1: PEEK enables policy generalization by modulating minimal representations of where to focus and what to do for robust policy learning. Our key idea is to offload high-level reasoning to visionlanguage models (VLMs), which can excel at semantic and visual generalization [7], [8], leaving the policy to determine how low-level behavior should be executed. Instead of forcing the policy to directly parse raw images and instructions, high-level VLM modulates the input representation to the low-level policy by providing: (1) path that encodes what the policy should do, and (2) masks showing where to attend. By absorbing semantic and visual variation, the VLM provides the policy simplified, annotated peek of the scene that gives the what and the where, while the policy only needs to learn how to perform the low-level actions. This intermediate representation helps policy execution inherit many of the VLMs semantic and visual generalization capabilities. Our VLM-modulated representation is naturally policy-agnostic, allowing it to be applied to arbitrary imageinput robot manipulation policies, including state-of-the-art RGB and 3D manipulation policies [1], [3], [9]. To concretely instantiate this insight into practical algorithm, we introduce PEEK (Policy-agnostic Extraction of Essential Keypoints), which proposes unified, pointbased intermediate representation that trains VLMs to predict what policies should do and where to focus on. Specifically, we propose to finetune pretrained VLMs [10] to predict sequence of points corresponding to (1) path that guides the robot end-effector in what actions to take and (2) set of task-relevant masking points that show the policy where to focus on (see Figure 1). During low-level visuomotor policy training and inference, we modulate the policys image observations by directly drawing these VLMpredicted paths and masks onto the image, allowing the policy to simply focus on how to act, rather than learning all three simultaneously. Doing so significantly bolsters policy generalization, combining the generality of high-level VLM predictions with the precision of low-level policy learning. In this paper, we instantiate full-stack implementation of PEEK, from devising scalable data annotation scheme that enables large-scale VLM finetuning on robotic datasets to representation-modulated training of low-level robot policies from simulation and real world data. In 535 real-world evaluations across 17 task variations, we demonstrate that PEEK consistently boosts zero-shot policy generalization: 3D policy (3DDA [9]) trained only in simulation achieves 41.4 higher success in the real world when guided by PEEK, and both large-scale vision-languageaction models (π0 [3]) and small transformer-based policies [1] see 23.5 success rate improvements. These results demonstrate the power of using high-level VLMs to absorb task complexity, providing low-level policies with exactly the minimal cues they need for generalizable manipulation. II. RELATED WORKS Object-Centric Representations. One approach to improving the visual generalization of imitation learning (IL) policies is to build object-centric representations [11][17]. Earlier works relied on human-selected abstractions or manual annotation [11], while more recent methods leverage pretrained, open-vocabulary segmentation models to visually isolate task-relevant objects [12][15], [17]. Among these, to our work, proposing policyARRO [13] is closest agnostic masking scheme using"

A scalable reinforcement learning method for learning continuous chain-of-thought tokens in large language models improves performance and diversity over discrete tokens while preserving out-of-domain predictions.  					AI-generated summary 				 The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens.   This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.

PEEK fine-tunes vision-language models to predict essential keypoints for robotic manipulation, enhancing zero-shot generalization across different policies and robot embodiments.  					AI-generated summary 				 Robotic manipulation policies often fail to generalize because they must simultaneously learn where to attend, what actions to take, and how to execute them. We argue that high-level reasoning about where and what can be offloaded to vision-language models (VLMs), leaving policies to specialize in how to act. We present PEEK (Policy-agnostic Extraction of Essential Keypoints), which fine-tunes VLMs to predict a unified point-based intermediate representation: 1. end-effector paths specifying what actions to take, and 2. task-relevant masks indicating where to focus. These annotations are directly overlaid onto robot observations, making the representation policy-agnostic and transferable across architectures. To enable scalable training, we introduce an automatic annotation pipeline, generating labeled data across 20+ robot datasets spanning 9 embodiments. In real-world evaluations, PEEK consistently boosts zero-shot generalization, including a 41.4x real-world improvement for a 3D policy trained only in simulation, and 2-3.5x gains for both large VLAs and small manipulation policies. By letting VLMs absorb semantic and visual complexity, PEEK equips manipulation policies with the minimal cues they need--where, what, and how. Website at https://peek-robot.github.io/.
