Text:"COMMONFORMS: Large, Diverse Dataset for Form Field Detection Joe Barrow Independent Researcher joseph.d.barrow@gmail.com 5 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 6 0 5 6 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r aThis paper introduces CommonForms, web-scale dataset for form field detection. It casts the problem of form field detection as object detection: given an image of page, predict the location and type (Text Input, Choice Button, Signature) of form fields. The dataset is constructed by filtering Common Crawl to find PDFs that have fillable elements. Starting with 8 million documents, the filtering process is used to arrive at final dataset of roughly 55k documents that have more than 450k pages. Analysis shows that the dataset contains diverse mixture of languages and domains; one third of the pages are nonEnglish, and among the 14 classified domains, no domain makes up more than 25% of the dataset. In addition, this paper presents family of form field detectors, FFDNet-Small and FFDNet-Large, which attain very high average precision on the CommonForms test set. Each model cost less than $500 to train. Ablation results show that high-resolution inputs are crucial for highquality form field detection, and that the cleaning process improves data efficiency over using all PDFs that have fillable fields in Common Crawl. qualitative analysis shows that they outperform popular and commercially available PDF reader that can prepare forms. Unlike the most popular commercially available solutions, FFDNet can predict checkboxes in addition to text and signature fields. This is, to our knowledge, the first large-scale dataset released for form field detection, as well as the first open-source models. The dataset, models, and code will be released at https://github.com/jbarrow/commonforms. 1. Introduction Despite decades of digitalization, large volume of realworld transactions still center around paper forms: insurance claims, municipal paperwork, school permission slips, and many, many others. These documents are often distributed as scans or non-fillable (flat) PDFs, and require either printing, tedious software workarounds, or turning to proprietary solution like Adobe Acrobat or Apple Preview. In order to be digitally filled, flat form must be prepared by having interactive form fields inserted. Although proprietary solutions may employ machine learning to prepare forms, there is not yet high-quality open-source machine learning-based system that can automatically and reliably prepare fillable forms. Converting flat PDF to an accessible form one that can be understood by screen reader, or filled automatically typically requires two steps: 1. form field detection: detecting the locations and types (e.g. text or checkbox) of fillable elements; and 2. form enrichment: grouping the fillable elements and their labels based on the semantics of the form. Previous work has primarily focused on the second [1, 2]. In this work, we tackle the first problem by detecting where the fillable elements should go visually in PDF. To this end, we construct and release both large-scale dataset, COMMONFORMS, consisting of more than 480k pages from more than 59k document forms. We also train and release family of form field detection models trained on this dataset, FFDNet-Small and FFDNetLarge. Training each of these models costs roughly $500 of compute or less, and yet these models are capable of highquality form field detection. They achieve high average precision of more than 80 on the COMMONFORMS test set. We perform qualitative analysis of these models against Adobe Acrobat and show that FFDNet has better recall and precision than Acrobat. COMMONFORMS is drawn from large collection of interactive PDF forms scraped from the Internet. The core insight of this paper is that quantity has quality all its own, and that we can leverage existing fillable forms as training signal. We use Common Crawl as wellspring of PDFs and apply rigorous cleaning process. This cleaning process results in improved data efficiency compared to using every PDF with form field. To train the FFDNet family of models, we cast the problem of form field detection as pure object detection problem. Given page image, the goal is to predict the location and types of each form element. The types are drawn from teh following set: {Choice Button, Text Figure 1. Overview of form field detection and preparation. Input, Signature}. This means that, unlike Adobe Acrobat and Apple Preview, FFDNet can predict the location of choice buttons (i.e. checkboxes and radio buttons). As of the time of publication, these tools only predict text form fields. The FFDNet models are high-resolution (1216px) YOLO11 [11] object detectors. Our ablation results show that high-resolution inputs are crucial to quality; models trained on 10k pages at varying resolutions show range of roughly 20 mean average precision points. Our contributions are as follows: we prepare release COMMONFORMS, large, diverse, and high quality dataset for form field detection; we train and release family of form field detection models on COMMONFORMS, FFDNet-Small and FFDNet-Large1; we provide an in depth analysis of COMMONFORMS to identify the represented languages and domains; and we compare the FFDNet models against the most popular commercial system, Adobe Acrobat, and show that they produce substantially higher quality forms. 2. Related Work Machine-learning-based work on document forms can be viewed as two broad categories: form preparation and form understanding. Form preparation is the task of making form fillable, whether that is detecting widgets or building semantic model of the form. Form understanding, also 1supported by LambdaLabs compute grant known as key information extraction (KIE), is an information extraction task on filled-out document forms. This paper is an instance of form preparation, which is the smaller of the two subfields. Form Preparation and Understanding Representative work on form preparation includes the line of work on Form2Seq [1, 2] and FormA11y [18]. Form2Seq formalizes semantic form model, treating it as joint classification and grouping task. Lower-level elements like widgets and text blocks are first classified into, e.g. ChoiceButton or TextField, and then grouped into higher-order categories like ChoiceGroup. However, it is assumed that the interactive form widgets have already been correctly detected. FormA11y takes human-in-the-loop approach in which users match labels to widgets to c"

A web-scale dataset and models for form field detection are introduced, achieving high precision and supporting diverse languages and domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper introduces CommonForms, a web-scale dataset for form field detection. It casts the problem of form field detection as object detection: given an image of a page, predict the location and type (Text Input, Choice Button, Signature) of form fields. The dataset is constructed by filtering Common Crawl to find PDFs that have fillable elements. Starting with 8 million documents, the filtering process is used to arrive at a final dataset of roughly 55k documents that have over 450k pages. Analysis shows that the dataset contains a diverse mixture of languages and domains; one third of the pages are non-English, and among the 14 classified domains, no domain makes up more than 25% of the dataset.   In addition, this paper presents a family of form field detectors, FFDNet-Small and FFDNet-Large, which attain a very high average precision on the CommonForms test set. Each model cost less than $500 to train. Ablation results show that high-resolution inputs are crucial for high-quality form field detection, and that the cleaning process improves data efficiency over using all PDFs that have fillable fields in Common Crawl. A qualitative analysis shows that they outperform a popular, commercially available PDF reader that can prepare forms. Unlike the most popular commercially available solutions, FFDNet can predict checkboxes in addition to text and signature fields. This is, to our knowledge, the first large scale dataset released for form field detection, as well as the first open source models. The dataset, models, and code will be released at https://github.com/jbarrow/commonforms

Задача формулируется как object detection: по изображению страницы нужно предсказать расположение и тип полей (текстовые поля, кнопки выбора, поля для подписи). Авторы обучили семейство моделей FFDNet-Small и FFDNet-Large, которые показывают высокую точность при стоимости обучения менее 500 долларов каждая.
