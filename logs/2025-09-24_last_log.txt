Existing methods predominantly rely on pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to 3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, new multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from predicted 3D voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignments reliance on error-prone 2D feature matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and enhanced novelview rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent Gaussian reconstructions.

Text:"5 2 0 2 3 2 ] . [ 2 3 8 0 7 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r HyRF: Hybrid Radiance Fields for Memory-efficient and High-quality Novel View Synthesis Zipeng Wang zwang253@cse.ust.hk Dan Xu danxu@cse.ust.hkRecently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as powerful alternative to NeRF-based approaches, enabling real-time, high-quality novel view synthesis through explicit, optimizable 3D Gaussians. However, 3DGS suffers from significant memory overhead due to its reliance on per-Gaussian parameters to model view-dependent effects and anisotropic shapes. While recent works propose compressing 3DGS with neural fields, these methods struggle to capture high-frequency spatial variations in Gaussian properties, leading to degraded reconstruction of fine details. We present Hybrid Radiance Fields (HyRF), novel scene representation that combines the strengths of explicit Gaussians and neural fields. HyRF decomposes the scene into (1) compact set of explicit Gaussians storing only critical high-frequency parameters and (2) grid-based neural fields that predict remaining properties. To enhance representational capacity, we introduce decoupled neural field architecture, separately modeling geometry (scale, opacity, rotation) and view-dependent color. Additionally, we propose hybrid rendering scheme that composites Gaussian splatting with neural field-predicted background, addressing limitations in distant scene representation. Experiments demonstrate that HyRF achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while reducing model size by over 20 compared to 3DGS and maintaining real-time performance. Our project page is available at https://wzpscott.github.io/hyrf/.Novel view synthesis is critical area in computer vision, with applications in scene manipulation [31, 44, 46, 32], autonomous driving [33, 42], virtual fly-throughs [43, 56, 24], and 3D generation models [19, 14, 12, 35]. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [25] have emerged as leading technology, leveraging implicit scene representations through neural networks and volume rendering to generate novel views. While NeRF-based methods excel in producing high-quality renderings with compact model sizes, they are hindered by slow rendering speeds. In recent advancements, the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [15] method has emerged as compelling alternative to NeRF-based approaches, enabling real-time rendering of high-resolution novel views. Unlike NeRF, which relies on continuous neural networks, 3DGS employs set of explicit, optimizable 3D Gaussians to represent scenes. This approach is able to bypass the computational overhead of volume rendering by leveraging an efficient differentiable point-based splatting process [57, 51], achieving real-time performance while enhancing rendering quality. However, 3DGS suffers from significant memory overhead due to its parameter-intensive representation of view-dependent colors and anisotropic shapes. Each 3D Gaussian requires 59 parameters, with 48 parameters dedicated to view-dependent color representation via spherical harmonics and 7 parameters encoding anisotropic scale and rotation. This stands in stark contrast to NeRF-based 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025). Figure 1: Mip-NeRF360 [3] struggles with inaccuracies in fine details and slow rendering speeds, while 3DGS [15] face challenges of large model sizes and blurry background. naive combination of neural fields and 3DGS leads to loss of high-frequency information. Our method overcomes these challenges through an innovative hybrid architecture. By synergistically combining neural fields, explicit Gaussians, and neural background map, we achieve competitive or superior performance in both visual quality and model compactness, while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. methods, which efficiently model view-dependent effects through neural network conditioning with minimal parameter growth. natural approach to reducing 3DGS storage costs is to encode 3D Gaussian properties in grid-based neural fields [48, 41]. However, this method faces fundamental limitation: the fixed resolution of grid-based representations struggles to capture the high-frequency spatial variations in 3D Gaussian properties. This issue is particularly pronounced when modeling scenes with rapid opacity and scale changes at object boundaries or high-frequency view-dependent effects. As result, naively fitting 3D Gaussians to neural fields often fails to reconstruct fine details, such as thin geometric structures and high-frequency color variations. In this paper, we present Hybrid Radiance Fields (HyRF), novel scene representation that effectively addresses the frequency limitations of neural Gaussian approaches while maintaining low memory overhead. Our key insight is to decompose the representation into two complementary components: grid-based neural fields that capture low-frequency variations, and sparse set of explicit compact Gaussians that preserve high-frequency details. Our neural component employs decoupled architecture with two specialized neural fields: geometry network dedicated to modeling geometric Gaussian properties (scale, opacity, and rotation), and separate appearance network for view-dependent color prediction. This explicit disentanglement of geometric and photometric learning objectives significantly enhances representational capacity of neural fields while maintaining parameter efficiency. Meanwhile, our explicit Gaussian component stores only essential properties, i.e., 3D positions, isotropic scales, opacity values, and diffuse colors, in order to minimize memory overhead while preserving critical scene details. To achieve both efficiency and rendering quality, we propose hybrid rendering pipeline that operates in three stages. First, our visibility pre-culling module eliminates Gaussians outside the current view frustum, significantly reducing computational overhead of querying neural fields. Next, we process the remaining visible Gaussians by querying their positions through our neural field to predict neural Gaussian properties, which are then combined with the stored explicit parameters to recover high-frequency details. To address the insufficient background modeling of Gaussian representations, we implement learnable solution where the neural field generates background map projected onto background sphere. This background map is composited with the foreground Gaussian rendering through alpha blending, therefore achieves "

Furthermore, it enables adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in wider communities.

"VolSplat, a voxel-aligned Gaussian prediction method, improves novel view synthesis by overcoming pixel alignment limitations and enhancing 3D reconstruction quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a 3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency.

Hybrid Radiance Fields combine explicit Gaussians and neural fields to achieve high-quality rendering with reduced memory usage and real-time performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful alternative to NeRF-based approaches, enabling real-time, high-quality novel view synthesis through explicit, optimizable 3D Gaussians. However, 3DGS suffers from significant memory overhead due to its reliance on per-Gaussian parameters to model view-dependent effects and anisotropic shapes. While recent works propose compressing 3DGS with neural fields, these methods struggle to capture high-frequency spatial variations in Gaussian properties, leading to degraded reconstruction of fine details. We present Hybrid Radiance Fields (HyRF), a novel scene representation that combines the strengths of explicit Gaussians and neural fields. HyRF decomposes the scene into (1) a compact set of explicit Gaussians storing only critical high-frequency parameters and (2) grid-based neural fields that predict remaining properties. To enhance representational capacity, we introduce a decoupled neural field architecture, separately modeling geometry (scale, opacity, rotation) and view-dependent color. Additionally, we propose a hybrid rendering scheme that composites Gaussian splatting with a neural field-predicted background, addressing limitations in distant scene representation. Experiments demonstrate that HyRF achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while reducing model size by over 20 times compared to 3DGS and maintaining real-time performance.

Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization (MAPO) dynamically reweights the advantage function to improve trajectory ranking in reinforcement learning for foundation models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in reinforcement learning for foundation models, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have significantly improved the performance of foundation models on reasoning tasks. Notably, the advantage function serves as a central mechanism in GRPO for ranking the trajectory importance. However, existing explorations encounter both advantage reversion and advantage mirror problems, which hinder the reasonable advantage allocation across different query samples. In this work, we propose an easy but effective GRPO strategy, Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization (MAPO). We reveal that the trajectory appears with different certainty and propose the advantage percent deviation for samples with high-certainty trajectories. Furthermore, we dynamically reweight the advantage function for samples with varying trajectory certainty, thereby adaptively configuring the advantage function to account for sample-specific characteristics. Comparison with related state-of-the-art methods, along with ablation studies on different advantage variants, validates the effectiveness of our approach.
