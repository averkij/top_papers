The paper analyzes SimulST latency metrics, identifies segmentation bias, and introduces YAAL and LongYAAL for more accurate latency evaluation, along with SoftSegmenter for improved alignment quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Simultaneous speech-to-text translation (SimulST) systems have to balance translation quality with latency--the delay between speech input and the translated output. While quality evaluation is well established, accurate latency measurement remains a challenge. Existing metrics often produce inconsistent or misleading results, especially in the widely used short-form setting, where speech is artificially presegmented. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of SimulST latency metrics across language pairs, systems, and both short- and long-form regimes. We uncover a structural bias in current metrics related to segmentation that undermines fair and meaningful comparisons. To address this, we introduce YAAL (Yet Another Average Lagging), a refined latency metric that delivers more accurate evaluations in the short-form regime. We extend YAAL to LongYAAL for unsegmented audio and propose SoftSegmenter, a novel resegmentation tool based on word-level alignment. Our experiments show that YAAL and LongYAAL outperform popular latency metrics, while SoftSegmenter enhances alignment quality in long-form evaluation, together enabling more reliable assessments of SimulST systems.

Авторы выявили структурную предвзятость в существующих метриках, связанную с сегментацией речи, что приводит к некорректным сравнениям систем. Для решения проблемы предложены новые метрики YAAL и LongYAAL, обеспечивающие более точную оценку задержки для коротких и длинных аудиофрагментов соответственно. Также представлен инструмент SoftSegmenter для улучшения качества выравнивания на уровне слов в длинных аудиозаписях.",
