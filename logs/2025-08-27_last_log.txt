Optogenetics [57] has revolutionized neuroscience by introducing lightmediated modulation in neural cells.; CRISPR-Cas9 [810] has changed the landscape of biological research by reinterpreting the bacterial immune system as platform for genome editing. Thomas Kuhn characterized such moments as paradigm shifts, arguing that these fundamental reorientations of scientific understanding cannot emerge through incremental progress. Over the last few decades, academia has witnessed an unprecedented surge in the sheer volume of scholarly publications [11, 12]; despite this, innovations on par with Kuhns portrayal have been rare [13]. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered traction as potential galvanizers of creativity. Supporting this sentiment is the notable performance of LLMs in various benchmarks that measure capabilities in science, programming, and reasoning [1418]. There have already been several attempts to capitalize on these advancements by creating agentic frameworks for scientific discovery [1925]. AlphaEvolve [26] finds solutions for local optimization problems, and multi-agent Virtual Lab [27] uncovers molecule-level candidates for SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies. However, we remain skeptical about whether systems that rely solely on LLMs can initiate artificial paradigm shifts. Transformer-based architectures optimize contextual coherence and penalize outputs that deviate from established patterns. Skewed evaluation metrics and human feedback further reinforce this behavior, leading to complementary systematic bias that favors soundness over novelty [28, 29]. The problem is that while building upon patterns, attempts at creative thinking easily degrade into regressions. For instance, the term CRISPR-Cas9 often recurs when prompted to generate research ideas, due to the overrepresentation of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology as novel research in training datasets. As result, LLM outputs tend to slant toward the precursory prompt context and the training data, implying that an automated ideation system powered by LLMs must overcome the limitations introduced by contextualization. To this end, we decompose"

Text:"UltraMemV2: Memory Networks Scaling to 120B Parameters with Superior Long-Context Learning Zihao Huang, Yu Bao, Qiyang Min, Siyan Chen, Ran Guo, Hongzhi Huang, Defa Zhu, Yutao Zeng, Banggu Wu, Xun Zhou, Siyuan QiaoMain authors and Corresponding authorsWhile Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections, adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6 points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization, and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting compelling alternative for efficient sparse computation.

[ 1 6 5 7 8 1 . 8 0 5 2 : rLarge language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across NLP tasks, but their exponential growth in parameters and computational complexity presents significant challenges for resource-constrained deployment. Mixture of Experts (MoE)[10, 11, 27, 29, 40] have emerged as promising solution by selectively activating expert subsets, effectively decoupling parameter count from computational cost. Recent works [25, 29] show that MoE with 8 activated experts achieves optimal performance-efficiency trade-offs, significantly outperforming configurations with fewer experts. However, MoE inference suffers from high memory access 1 costs due to expert routing overhead, particularly problematic when only small fraction of tokens activate all experts. Memory-layer architectures[2, 18, 26] offer an alternative sparse model with significantly less memory access. Unlike MoEs FFN-type expert, memory layers activate embeddings from large parameter table, enabling extremely slowly linear scaling of memory access with sequence length. The Over-tokenized Transformer [16] can also be viewed as memory-layer architecture, where an n-gram router activates embeddings from memory table that are subsequently added to the word embeddings. While architectures like UltraMem[18] demonstrate promising inference characteristics, they have only matched the performance of MoE with 2 activated experts, falling short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations by substantial margin. This performance gap motivates our work. We introduce UltraMemV2, redesigned memory-layer architecture that bridges the performance divide between embedding-based and expert-based sparse models. Our approach incorporates five key innovations: (1) architectural integration: tighter coupling between memory layers and Transformer blocks with memory layers in every block; (2) simplified value expansion: streamlined Implicit Value Expansion (IVE) using single linear projections; (3) expert-like value processing: adoption of PEERs FFN-based value computation [12]; (4) optimized initialization: principled parameter initialization preventing training divergence; and (5) computational rebalancing: adjusted memory-to-FFN computation ratios. Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves performance parity with 8-expert MoE models while maintaining memory layer advantages. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows superior performance on memory-intensive tasks including long-context memorization (+1.6 points), multi-round memorization (+6.2 points), and in-context learning (+7.9 points). We validate scalability up to 2.5B activated parameters with 120B total parameters, and establish that activation density (top-m values) has greater impact on performance than total sparse parameter count. In summary, our work makes three primary contributions: (1) Architectural advancement: We present the first memory-layer architecture competitive with state-of-the-art 8-expert MoE models, closing significant performance gap in sparse model research. (2) Comprehensive analysis: We provide detailed ablation studies and comparative analysis revealing when and why UltraMemV2 outperforms MoE, particularly on memory-intensive tasks, while identifying trade-offs in different training phases. (3) Scalability validation: We demonstrate UltraMemV2s effectiveness at scale and establish design principles for activation density versus parameter count trade-offs, providing guidance for future memory-layer architectures.MoE Architecture The concept of MoE was first introduced by Shazeer et al. [34]. Since then, numerous studies [8, 10, 21, 31] have been conducted to improve its performance and efficiency. During this period, the general perception is that appropriately using smaller experts but activating greater number can enhance the performance of MoE, typically activating two experts. Krajewski et al. [25] systematically studied the influence of expert size and the number of activations, which is called granularity. They found that when the granularity was 8, MoE achieved the best performance and was significantly better than 2. The same conclusion was also discovered by OLMoE[29]. Resent MOEs in the industrial sector (DeepSeek-V3[27], Qwen3[39], dots.llm1[19]) have all adopted this structure. However, they still face challenges in inference, s"

Index TermsDiffusion Models, Image Generation, Video Generation, High ResolutionDiffusion models have revolutionized visual generation [1] [6], empowering individuals without any artistic expertise to effortlessly create distinctive and personalized designs, graphics, and short films using specific textual descriptions. Nonetheless, current visual diffusion models are generally trained on data with limited resolution, such as 5122 for SD 1.5 [7], 10242 for SDXL [1], and 320 512 for VideoCrafter2 [4], hampering their ability to generate highfidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Given the scarcity of high-resolution visual data and the substantially greater model capacity required for modeling such *This work was done during an internship at Netflix Eyeline Studios, (cid:66)corresponding authors H. Qiu, Z. Huang, and Z. Liu are with Nanyang Technological University. Email: {HAONAN002, ZIQI002}@e.ntu.edu.sg, ziwei.liu@ntu.edu.sg H. Qiu, N. Yu, and P. Debevec are with Netflix Eyeline Studios. Email: {ning.yu, debevec}@scanlinevfx.com data, recent efforts have focused on employing tuning-free strategies for high-resolution visual generation to inherit the strong generation capacities of existing pre-trained diffusion models. Despite the advances achieved by existing methods, they are still prone to producing low-quality images or videos, particularly manifesting as repetitive object occurrences and unreasonable object structures. ScaleCrafter [8] puts forward that the primary cause of the object repetition issue is the limited convolutional receptive field and uses dilated convolutional layers to achieve tuning-free higher-resolution sampling. But the generated results of ScaleCrafter still suffer from the problem of local repetition. Inspired by MultiDiffusion [9] fusing the local patches of the whole images, DemoFusion [10] designed mechanism by fusing the local patches and global patches, almost eliminating the local repetition. Essentially, this solution just transfers the extra signal of the object to the background, leading to small object repetition generation. FouriScale [11] reduces those extra signals by removing the high-frequency signals of the latent before the convolution operation. Although FouriScale completely eliminates all types of repetition, the generated results always have weird colors and textures due to its violent editing on the frequency domain. To generate satisfactory visual contents without any unexpected repetition, we propose FreeScale, tuning-free inference paradigm that enables pre-trained image and video diffusion models to generate vivid higher-resolution results. Building on past effective modules [8], [12], we first propose tailored self-cascade upscaling and restrained dilated convolution to gain the basic visual structure and maintain the quality in higher-resolution generation. To further eliminate all kinds of unexpected object repetitions, FreeScale processes information from different receptive scales and then fuses it by extracting desired frequency components, ensuring both the structures overall rationality and the objects local quality. This fusion is smoothly integrated into the original self-attention layers, thereby bringing only minimal additional time overhead. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both the text-to-image model and the text-to-video model, pushing the boundaries of image generation even up to an 8k resolution. Benefiting from the exceptional scalability, DiT has become the dominant architecture in the development of recent foundational diffusion models. Nevertheless, FreeScale and the majority of existing works are built upon the UNet 00000000/00$00.00 2021 IEEE JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST architecture. Due to the architectural gap, these methods exhibit limited effectiveness on DiT-based models. Specifically, the major challenge faced by DiT-based models in highresolution generation is the substantial increase in token count, which results in untrained positional embeddings and overly diluted attention, ultimately hindering generation quality. Indeed, these challenges have been thoroughly explored in large language models for long-text generation [13], [14], providing valuable empirical knowledge like NTK-aware interpolation and attention reweighting. Combining those technologies, we extend the original FreeScale framework by tailoring it to the architectural properties of DiT, yielding new variant that supports high-resolution generation on DiT-based models.

A framework using Multimodal Large Language Models and a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture generates semantically coherent and expressive character animations from multimodal inputs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or context. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework designed to generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also semantically coherent and expressive. Our model, OmniHuman-1.5, is built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions that provides high-level semantic guidance.

"A framework using Multimodal Large Language Models and a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture generates semantically coherent and expressive character animations from multimodal inputs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's authentic essence.

UltraMemV2, a redesigned memory-layer architecture, achieves performance parity with 8-expert MoE models while significantly reducing memory access costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections, adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6 points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization, and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting a compelling alternative for efficient sparse computation.

PIXIE, a neural network method, predicts physical properties of 3D scenes from visual features, enabling fast and realistic physics simulation using supervised learning and pretrained visual features.  					AI-generated summary 				 Inferring the physical properties of 3D scenes from visual information is a critical yet challenging task for creating interactive and realistic virtual worlds. While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever been trained on synthetic data. https://pixie-3d.github.io/

ThinkDial is an open-source framework that implements controllable reasoning in large language models through discrete operational modes, achieving performance while reducing computational effort.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment. Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50 percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode (75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

Wan-S2V, an audio-driven model built on Wan, enhances expressiveness and fidelity in cinematic character animation compared to existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan. Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions. Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

CTF-Dojo, a large-scale executable runtime with 658 CTF challenges, enables rapid training of LLM-based agents with verifiable feedback, achieving state-of-the-art performance in competitive benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality, execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1, establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary systems.

"CTF-Dojo, a large-scale executable runtime with 658 CTF challenges, enables rapid training of LLM-based agents with verifiable feedback, achieving state-of-the-art performance in competitive benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality, execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1, establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary systems."

CineScale is a novel inference paradigm that enables high-resolution visual generation for both images and videos without extensive fine-tuning, addressing issues of repetitive patterns and high-frequency information accumulation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models. Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning, and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning.

A framework for efficient artistic mesh generation reduces redundancy by separating vertex and face generation, using an autoregressive model for vertices and a bidirectional transformer for faces, and includes a fidelity enhancer and post-processing to improve quality and speed.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer. Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality, we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than 8times faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

A network-based framework links cognitive skills, LLM architectures, and datasets, revealing unique emergent skill patterns in LLMs that benefit from dynamic, cross-regional interactions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots. Despite their ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.

We address this gap by adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions."
