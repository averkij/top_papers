Optogenetics [57] has revolutionized neuroscience by introducing lightmediated modulation in neural cells.; CRISPR-Cas9 [810] has changed the landscape of biological research by reinterpreting the bacterial immune system as platform for genome editing. Thomas Kuhn characterized such moments as paradigm shifts, arguing that these fundamental reorientations of scientific understanding cannot emerge through incremental progress. Over the last few decades, academia has witnessed an unprecedented surge in the sheer volume of scholarly publications [11, 12]; despite this, innovations on par with Kuhns portrayal have been rare [13]. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered traction as potential galvanizers of creativity. Supporting this sentiment is the notable performance of LLMs in various benchmarks that measure capabilities in science, programming, and reasoning [1418]. There have already been several attempts to capitalize on these advancements by creating agentic frameworks for scientific discovery [1925]. AlphaEvolve [26] finds solutions for local optimization problems, and multi-agent Virtual Lab [27] uncovers molecule-level candidates for SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies. However, we remain skeptical about whether systems that rely solely on LLMs can initiate artificial paradigm shifts. Transformer-based architectures optimize contextual coherence and penalize outputs that deviate from established patterns. Skewed evaluation metrics and human feedback further reinforce this behavior, leading to complementary systematic bias that favors soundness over novelty [28, 29]. The problem is that while building upon patterns, attempts at creative thinking easily degrade into regressions. For instance, the term CRISPR-Cas9 often recurs when prompted to generate research ideas, due to the overrepresentation of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology as novel research in training datasets. As result, LLM outputs tend to slant toward the precursory prompt context and the training data, implying that an automated ideation system powered by LLMs must overcome the limitations introduced by contextualization. To this end, we decompose"

Index TermsDiffusion Models, Image Generation, Video Generation, High ResolutionDiffusion models have revolutionized visual generation [1] [6], empowering individuals without any artistic expertise to effortlessly create distinctive and personalized designs, graphics, and short films using specific textual descriptions. Nonetheless, current visual diffusion models are generally trained on data with limited resolution, such as 5122 for SD 1.5 [7], 10242 for SDXL [1], and 320 512 for VideoCrafter2 [4], hampering their ability to generate highfidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Given the scarcity of high-resolution visual data and the substantially greater model capacity required for modeling such *This work was done during an internship at Netflix Eyeline Studios, (cid:66)corresponding authors H.

Email: {ning.yu, debevec}@scanlinevfx.com data, recent efforts have focused on employing tuning-free strategies for high-resolution visual generation to inherit the strong generation capacities of existing pre-trained diffusion models. Despite the advances achieved by existing methods, they are still prone to producing low-quality images or videos, particularly manifesting as repetitive object occurrences and unreasonable object structures. ScaleCrafter [8] puts forward that the primary cause of the object repetition issue is the limited convolutional receptive field and uses dilated convolutional layers to achieve tuning-free higher-resolution sampling. But the generated results of ScaleCrafter still suffer from the problem of local repetition. Inspired by MultiDiffusion [9] fusing the local patches of the whole images, DemoFusion [10] designed mechanism by fusing the local patches and global patches, almost eliminating the local repetition. Essentially, this solution just transfers the extra signal of the object to the background, leading to small object repetition generation. FouriScale [11] reduces those extra signals by removing the high-frequency signals of the latent before the convolution operation. Although FouriScale completely eliminates all types of repetition, the generated results always have weird colors and textures due to its violent editing on the frequency domain. To generate satisfactory visual contents without any unexpected repetition, we propose FreeScale, tuning-free inference paradigm that enables pre-trained image and video diffusion models to generate vivid higher-resolution results. Building on past effective modules [8], [12], we first propose tailored self-cascade upscaling and restrained dilated convolution to gain the basic visual structure and maintain the quality in higher-resolution generation. To further eliminate all kinds of unexpected object repetitions, FreeScale processes information from different receptive scales and then fuses it by extracting desired frequency components, ensuring both the structures overall rationality and the objects local quality. This fusion is smoothly integrated into the original self-attention layers, thereby bringing only minimal additional time overhead. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both the text-to-image model and the text-to-video model, pushing the boundaries of image generation even up to an 8k resolution. Benefiting from the exceptional scalability, DiT has become the dominant architecture in the development of recent foundational diffusion models. Nevertheless, FreeScale and the majority of existing works are built upon the UNet 00000000/00$00.00 2021 IEEE JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST architecture. Due to the architectural gap, these methods exhibit limited effectiveness on DiT-based models. Specifically, the major challenge faced by DiT-based models in highresolution generation is the substantial increase in token count, which results in untrained positional embeddings and overly diluted attention, ultimately hindering generation quality. Indeed, these challenges have been thoroughly explored in large language models for long-text generation [13], [14], providing valuable empirical knowledge like NTK-aware interpolation and attention reweighting. Combining those technologies, we extend the original FreeScale framework by tailoring it to the architectural properties of DiT, yielding new variant that supports high-resolution generation on DiT-based models.

ObjFiller-3D uses video editing models to achieve high-quality and consistent 3D object completion, outperforming previous methods in terms of reconstruction fidelity and practical deployment.  					AI-generated summary 				 3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition, we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of 0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications.
