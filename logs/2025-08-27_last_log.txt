[ 1 5 5 2 8 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r Ryan Teknium* X: @Teknium1 Roger Jin X: @rogershijin Jai Suphavadeeprasit X: @JSupa15 Dakota Mahan X: @dmayhem93 Jeffrey Quesnelle X: @theemozilla Joe Li X: @JoeLi Chen Guang X: @nullvaluetensor Shannon Sands X: @max_paperclips Karan Malhotra X: @karan4dWe present Hermes 4, family of hybrid reasoning models that combine structured, multi-step reasoning with broad instruction-following ability. We describe the challenges encountered during data curation, synthesis, training, and evaluation, and outline the solutions employed to address these challenges at scale. We comprehensively evaluate across mathematical reasoning, coding, knowledge, comprehension, and alignment benchmarks, and we report both quantitative performance and qualitative behavioral analysis. To support open research, all model weights are published publicly at https://huggingface.co/NousResearch2.LLMs, at this point, need no introduction. Their effectiveness at approximating aspects of human cognition despite comparatively simple training objectives has made them subject of both academic investigation and practical deployment. In recent years, growing body of work has explored inference-time scaling mechanisms (often described as reasoner" models) which dynamically adjust the amount of computation devoted to solving task [35, 15]. Initially, reasoner models were available only from proprietary providers. More recently, number of open-weight reasoning systems have been released, enabling the community to study, evaluate, and improve upon these methods in an open setting [57, 15, 48]. In this report we introduce Hermes 4, family of neutrally-aligned generalist models trained to integrate self-reflective reasoning with broad instructional competence. The contributions of this work are threefold: data synthesis and curation strategy that produces large-scale hybrid dataset consisting of both reasoning-focused and general purpose instruction examples (Section2); training methodology that incorporates loss-masking, length-control fine-tuning, and efficient packing strategies for large-scale heterogeneous data (Section 3); Correspondence to teknium@nousresearch.com. 2https://huggingface.co/collections/NousResearch/hermes-4-collection-68a731bfd452e20816725728 Hermes 4 Technical Report comprehensive evaluation across reasoning, code, knowledge, alignment, and qualitative benchmarks (Section 4, 5). Together, these contributions demonstrate how open-weight reasoning models can be effectively trained and rigorously evaluated, yielding models that are comparable to frontier systems while remaining transparent and reproducible.The Hermes 4 dataset consists primarily of newly synthesized reasoning and non-reasoning data, totaling approximately 5 million samples and 19 billion tokens. It was designed to imbue the model with advanced reasoning capabilities while maintaining broad base of general knowledge and instruction-following proficiency. The data strategy focused on hybrid approach, combining substantial volume of reasoning-focused data with diverse set of non-reasoning instructions. The dataset is composite of 3.5 million reasoning samples and 1.6 million non-reasoning samples. significant portion of the Hermes 3 [51] dataset3 was retained to ensure continuity in the models capabilities. The reasoning samples were intentionally token-heavy, with an average of five times more tokens per sample than their non-reasoning counterparts, accommodating thinking traces up to 16 thousand tokens long.We process pre-training seed data through graph-based synthetic data generator called DataForge. Inspired by AgentInstruct [31] , DataForge generates conversational data across wide variety of tasks. Each datapoint is generated via random walk through directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node implements struct struct map. Specifically, each node implements the PDDL [9] action interface, defining preconditions and postconditions which determine data flow. The edges in this DAG are thus implicit, i.e. directed edge exists from node to node if and only if the postconditions guaranteed by satisfy the preconditions of B. This design enables declarative construction of agent graphs, facilitating the specification of large and complex structures. We show an example graph in Figure 1 for single-turn QA data."
