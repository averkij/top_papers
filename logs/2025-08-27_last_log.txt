Optogenetics [57] has revolutionized neuroscience by introducing lightmediated modulation in neural cells.; CRISPR-Cas9 [810] has changed the landscape of biological research by reinterpreting the bacterial immune system as platform for genome editing. Thomas Kuhn characterized such moments as paradigm shifts, arguing that these fundamental reorientations of scientific understanding cannot emerge through incremental progress. Over the last few decades, academia has witnessed an unprecedented surge in the sheer volume of scholarly publications [11, 12]; despite this, innovations on par with Kuhns portrayal have been rare [13]. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered traction as potential galvanizers of creativity. Supporting this sentiment is the notable performance of LLMs in various benchmarks that measure capabilities in science, programming, and reasoning [1418]. There have already been several attempts to capitalize on these advancements by creating agentic frameworks for scientific discovery [1925]. AlphaEvolve [26] finds solutions for local optimization problems, and multi-agent Virtual Lab [27] uncovers molecule-level candidates for SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies. However, we remain skeptical about whether systems that rely solely on LLMs can initiate artificial paradigm shifts. Transformer-based architectures optimize contextual coherence and penalize outputs that deviate from established patterns. Skewed evaluation metrics and human feedback further reinforce this behavior, leading to complementary systematic bias that favors soundness over novelty [28, 29]. The problem is that while building upon patterns, attempts at creative thinking easily degrade into regressions. For instance, the term CRISPR-Cas9 often recurs when prompted to generate research ideas, due to the overrepresentation of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology as novel research in training datasets. As result, LLM outputs tend to slant toward the precursory prompt context and the training data, implying that an automated ideation system powered by LLMs must overcome the limitations introduced by contextualization. To this end, we decompose"

Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections, adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6 points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization, and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting compelling alternative for efficient sparse computation.

[ 1 6 5 7 8 1 . 8 0 5 2 : rLarge language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across NLP tasks, but their exponential growth in parameters and computational complexity presents significant challenges for resource-constrained deployment. Mixture of Experts (MoE)[10, 11, 27, 29, 40] have emerged as promising solution by selectively activating expert subsets, effectively decoupling parameter count from computational cost. Recent works [25, 29] show that MoE with 8 activated experts achieves optimal performance-efficiency trade-offs, significantly outperforming configurations with fewer experts. However, MoE inference suffers from high memory access 1 costs due to expert routing overhead, particularly problematic when only small fraction of tokens activate all experts. Memory-layer architectures[2, 18, 26] offer an alternative sparse model with significantly less memory access. Unlike MoEs FFN-type expert, memory layers activate embeddings from large parameter table, enabling extremely slowly linear scaling of memory access with sequence length. The Over-tokenized Transformer [16] can also be viewed as memory-layer architecture, where an n-gram router activates embeddings from memory table that are subsequently added to the word embeddings. While architectures like UltraMem[18] demonstrate promising inference characteristics, they have only matched the performance of MoE with 2 activated experts, falling short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations by substantial margin. This performance gap motivates our work. We introduce UltraMemV2, redesigned memory-layer architecture that bridges the performance divide between embedding-based and expert-based sparse models. Our approach incorporates five key innovations: (1) architectural integration: tighter coupling between memory layers and Transformer blocks with memory layers in every block; (2) simplified value expansion: streamlined Implicit Value Expansion (IVE) using single linear projections; (3) expert-like value processing: adoption of PEERs FFN-based value computation [12]; (4) optimized initialization: principled parameter initialization preventing training divergence; and (5) computational rebalancing: adjusted memory-to-FFN computation ratios. Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves performance parity with 8-expert MoE models while maintaining memory layer advantages. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows superior performance on memory-intensive tasks including long-context memorization (+1.6 points), multi-round memorization (+6.2 points), and in-context learning (+7.9 points). We validate scalability up to 2.5B activated parameters with 120B total parameters, and establish that activation density (top-m values) has greater impact on performance than total sparse parameter count. In summary, our work makes three primary contributions: (1) Architectural advancement: We present the first memory-layer architecture competitive with state-of-the-art 8-expert MoE models, closing significant performance gap in sparse model research. (2) Comprehensive analysis: We provide detailed ablation studies and comparative analysis revealing when and why UltraMemV2 outperforms MoE, particularly on memory-intensive tasks, while identifying trade-offs in different training phases. (3) Scalability validation: We demonstrate UltraMemV2s effectiveness at scale and establish design principles for activation density versus parameter count trade-offs, providing guidance for future memory-layer architectures.MoE Architecture The concept of MoE was first introduced by Shazeer et al. [34]. Since then, numerous studies [8, 10, 21, 31] have been conducted to improve its performance and efficiency. During this period, the general perception is that appropriately using smaller experts but activating greater number can enhance the performance of MoE, typically activating two experts. Krajewski et al. [25] systematically studied the influence of expert size and the number of activations, which is called granularity. They found that when the granularity was 8, MoE achieved the best performance and was significantly better than 2. The same conclusion was also discovered by OLMoE[29]. Resent MOEs in the industrial sector (DeepSeek-V3[27], Qwen3[39], dots.llm1[19]) have all adopted this structure. However, they still face challenges in inference, s"

Text:"TreePO: Bridging the Gap of Policy Optimization and Efficacy and Inference Efficiency with Heuristic Tree-based Modeling ByteDance Seed, M-A-P, UoM Full author list in Contributions Abstract Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems, but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key contributions include: (1) segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along with an early-stop mechanism; (2) tree-based segment-level advantage estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization. and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain of TreePO on set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours from 22% up to 43% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile showing up to 40% reduction at trajectory-level and 35% at token-level sampling compute for the existing models. While offering free lunch of inference efficiency, TreePO reveals practical path toward scaling RL-based post-training with fewer samples and less compute.

Index TermsDiffusion Models, Image Generation, Video Generation, High ResolutionDiffusion models have revolutionized visual generation [1] [6], empowering individuals without any artistic expertise to effortlessly create distinctive and personalized designs, graphics, and short films using specific textual descriptions. Nonetheless, current visual diffusion models are generally trained on data with limited resolution, such as 5122 for SD 1.5 [7], 10242 for SDXL [1], and 320 512 for VideoCrafter2 [4], hampering their ability to generate highfidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Given the scarcity of high-resolution visual data and the substantially greater model capacity required for modeling such *This work was done during an internship at Netflix Eyeline Studios, (cid:66)corresponding authors H. Qiu, Z. Huang, and Z. Liu are with Nanyang Technological University. Email: {HAONAN002, ZIQI002}@e.ntu.edu.sg, ziwei.liu@ntu.edu.sg H. Qiu, N. Yu, and P. Debevec are with Netflix Eyeline Studios. Email: {ning.yu, debevec}@scanlinevfx.com data, recent efforts have focused on employing tuning-free strategies for high-resolution visual generation to inherit the strong generation capacities of existing pre-trained diffusion models. Despite the advances achieved by existing methods, they are still prone to producing low-quality images or videos, particularly manifesting as repetitive object occurrences and unreasonable object structures. ScaleCrafter [8] puts forward that the primary cause of the object repetition issue is the limited convolutional receptive field and uses dilated convolutional layers to achieve tuning-free higher-resolution sampling. But the generated results of ScaleCrafter still suffer from the problem of local repetition. Inspired by MultiDiffusion [9] fusing the local patches of the whole images, DemoFusion [10] designed mechanism by fusing the local patches and global patches, almost eliminating the local repetition. Essentially, this solution just transfers the extra signal of the object to the background, leading to small object repetition generation. FouriScale [11] reduces those extra signals by removing the high-frequency signals of the latent before the convolution operation. Although FouriScale completely eliminates all types of repetition, the generated results always have weird colors and textures due to its violent editing on the frequency domain. To generate satisfactory visual contents without any unexpected repetition, we propose FreeScale, tuning-free inference paradigm that enables pre-trained image and video diffusion models to generate vivid higher-resolution results. Building on past effective modules [8], [12], we first propose tailored self-cascade upscaling and restrained dilated convolution to gain the basic visual structure and maintain the quality in higher-resolution generation. To further eliminate all kinds of unexpected object repetitions, FreeScale processes information from different receptive scales and then fuses it by extracting desired frequency components, ensuring both the structures overall rationality and the objects local quality. This fusion is smoothly integrated into the original self-attention layers, thereby bringing only minimal additional time overhead. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both the text-to-image model and the text-to-video model, pushing the boundaries of image generation even up to an 8k resolution. Benefiting from the exceptional scalability, DiT has become the dominant architecture in the development of recent foundational diffusion models. Nevertheless, FreeScale and the majority of existing works are built upon the UNet 00000000/00$00.00 2021 IEEE JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST architecture. Due to the architectural gap, these methods exhibit limited effectiveness on DiT-based models. Specifically, the major challenge faced by DiT-based models in highresolution generation is the substantial increase in token count, which results in untrained positional embeddings and overly diluted attention, ultimately hindering generation quality. Indeed, these challenges have been thoroughly explored in large language models for long-text generation [13], [14], providing valuable empirical knowledge like NTK-aware interpolation and attention reweighting. Combining those technologies, we extend the original FreeScale framework by tailoring it to the architectural properties of DiT, yielding new variant that supports high-resolution generation on DiT-based models.

CMPhysBench evaluates LLMs in condensed matter physics using calculation problems and a new SEED score for partial credit assessment, revealing significant capability gaps.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce CMPhysBench, designed to assess the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Condensed Matter Physics, as a novel Benchmark. CMPhysBench is composed of more than 520 graduate-level meticulously curated questions covering both representative subfields and foundational theoretical frameworks of condensed matter physics, such as magnetism, superconductivity, strongly correlated systems, etc. To ensure a deep understanding of the problem-solving process,we focus exclusively on calculation problems, requiring LLMs to independently generate comprehensive solutions. Meanwhile, leveraging tree-based representations of expressions, we introduce the Scalable Expression Edit Distance (SEED) score, which provides fine-grained (non-binary) partial credit and yields a more accurate assessment of similarity between prediction and ground-truth. Our results show that even the best models, Grok-4, reach only 36 average SEED score and 28% accuracy on CMPhysBench, underscoring a significant capability gap, especially for this practical and frontier domain relative to traditional physics. The code anddataset are publicly available at https://github.com/CMPhysBench/CMPhysBench.

TreePO, a self-guided rollout algorithm for sequence generation, reduces computational cost and enhances exploration diversity in reinforcement learning for large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems, but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key contributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along with an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization. and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain of TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours from 22\% up to 43\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile showing up to 40\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\% at token-level sampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of inference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based post-training with fewer samples and less compute.

QueryBandits, a bandit framework, effectively mitigates hallucinations in LLMs by proactively rewriting queries based on linguistic features, outperforming static prompting strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused higher hallucination prevalence; yet most mitigation work focuses on after-the-fact filtering rather than shaping the queries that trigger them. We introduce QueryBandits, a bandit framework that designs rewrite strategies to maximize a reward model, that encapsulates hallucination propensity based upon the sensitivities of 17 linguistic features of the input query-and therefore, proactively steer LLMs away from generating hallucinations. Across 13 diverse QA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top contextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a no-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting ("paraphrase" or "expand") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively. Therefore, we empirically substantiate the effectiveness of QueryBandits in mitigating hallucination via the intervention that takes the form of a query rewrite. Interestingly, certain static prompting strategies, which constitute a considerable number of current query rewriting literature, have a higher cumulative regret than the no-rewrite baseline, signifying that static rewrites can worsen hallucination. Moreover, we discover that the converged per-arm regression feature weight vectors substantiate that there is no single rewrite strategy optimal for all queries. In this context, guided rewriting via exploiting semantic features with QueryBandits can induce significant shifts in output behavior through forward-pass mechanisms, bypassing the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation.

AUSM, an autoregressive universal segmentation model, unifies prompted and unprompted video segmentation by treating it as sequential mask prediction, achieving superior performance and faster training on standard benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation. Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS 2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster training on 16-frame sequences.

MovieCORE is a video question answering dataset that uses multiple large language models to generate deep cognitive questions, and introduces an agentic enhancement module to improve VQA model performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA) dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content. Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach, utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with more challenging, nuanced questions about cinematic content.
