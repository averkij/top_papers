Text:"DASH: Faster Shampoo via Batched Block Preconditioning and Efficient Inverse-Root Solvers Ionut-Vlad Modoranu 1 Philip Zmushko 1 Erik Schultheis 1 Mher Safaryan 2 Dan AlistarhShampoo is one of the leading approximate second-order optimizers: variant of it has won the MLCommons AlgoPerf competition, and it has been shown to produce models with lower activation outliers that are easier to compress. Yet, applying Shampoo currently comes at the cost of significant computational slowdown, due to its expensive internal operations. In this paper, we take significant step to address this shortcoming by proposing DASH (for Distributed Accelerated SHampoo), faster implementation of Distributed Shampoo based on two main new techniques: First, we show that preconditioner blocks can be stacked into 3D tensors to significantly improve GPU utilization; second, we introduce the Newton-DB iteration and the Chebyshev polynomial approximations as novel and faster approaches for computing the inverse matrix roots required by Shampoo. Along with these algorithmic contributions, we provide first in-depth analysis of how matrix scaling critically affects Shampoo convergence. On the practical side, our GPU-aware implementation achieves up to 4.83 faster optimizer steps compared to the well-optimized Distributed Shampoo, while Newton-DB attains the lowest validation perplexity per iteration among all tested methods.

Introduction The promise of faster adaptive gradient optimization methods has led to full spectrum of methods inspired by the full-matrix AdaGrad optimizer (Duchi et al., 2011). At one end, the full-matrix approach offers theoretical guarantees but is computationally prohibitive for large models due to 1Institute of Science and Technology Austria 2Lancaster University 3Red Hat AI. Correspondence to: Ionut-Vlad Modoranu <ionut-vlad.modoranu@ista.ac.at>. Preprint. February 3, 2026. 1 its O(m2n2) memory complexity for an layer. At the other end, diagonal approximations such as Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) and AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) reduce this complexity to O(mn), and have become standard for deep learning. Yet, diagonal methods fail to capture complex parameter correlations, leading to significant work on efficiently incorporating non-diagonal information into optimizers, without incurring the prohibitive costs of fullmatrix methods. One such instance is the Shampoo optimizer (Gupta et al., 2018; Anil et al., 2020), which captures layer-wise second-order information, while maintaining manageable memory complexity of O(m2 + n2), making higher-order optimization feasible for large-scale models. Historically, Shampoo has remained in the shadow of standard diagonal optimizers like AdamW. Recently, however, Shampoo has gained significant traction, highlighted by its leading performance in the AlgoPerf benchmarking competition (Dahl et al., 2023), where it proved to be the best in terms of wall-clock time required to reach target training performance. Further, recent studies suggest that converged solutions found by Shampoo possess desirable properties, such as improved generalization (Pascanu et al., 2025) and robustness to quantization (Vlassis et al., 2025). While Shampoos memory complexity is manageable, the optimizer still incurs substantial computational overhead per optimizer step, relative to AdamW. Specifically, the algorithm requires computing inverse matrix roots, an operation that typically scales as Θ(n3) for an preconditioner matrix. To amortize this cost, standard implementations update the preconditioners infrequently (e.g., every 10100 steps). However, this creates trade-off between runtime speed and optimization quality: for example, evidence from Vyas et al. (2024) (see Figure 1 therein) indicates that more frequent preconditioner updates directly lead to better performance. The Distributed Shampoo implementation (Shi et al., 2023) addresses some of these computational bottlenecks by splitting preconditioners into blocks of the size with < n, effectively reducing the complexity to O(Bn2). Yet, the underlying algorithms still have critical efficiency gaps: for instance, the default implementation still relies DASH: Faster Shampoo via Batched Block Preconditioning and Efficient Inverse-Root Solvers on EVD1, an operation that is notoriously difficult to parallelize on GPUs. Although Distributed Shampoo introduced more GPU-friendly, matrix-multiplication-based alternative relying on the Coupled-Newton (CN) iteration, this is not enabled by default, likely due to concerns regarding numerical stability2. Motivated by this efficiency gap for Shampoo, in this paper we aim to significantly reduce the computational overhead of Shampoo while preserving its numerical precision. We focus on accelerating the inverse matrix root computation, which is the algorithms primary bottleneck, by making high-quality preconditioning practical for widespread use. To this end, we propose DASH (Distributed Accelerated SHampoo), high-performance implementation designed to fully leverage modern GPU architectures. By bridging the gap between theoretical efficiency and hardware support, DASH empowers researchers to investigate the optimizers properties in diverse settings without prohibitive runtimes. Our contributions are as follows: 1. We introduce DASH, novel GPU-efficient approach for block preconditioners. The sequential loops used in prior Distributed Shampoo implementation are replaced with independent blocks stacked into 3-D tensors and processed in parallel, to significantly increase GPU utilization. This architectural change, combined with halfprecision support (FP16), reduces the running time of the optimizer step by up to 5 compared to the standard Distributed Shampoo. 2. We investigate two new advanced linear algebraic approaches for computing matrix powers in the context of deep learning optimizers: the Newton-Denman-Beavers (Newton-DB) iteration (Higham, 2008) and Chebyshev polynomial approximation using Clenshaws algorithm (Cody, 1970; Boyd, 2001). Motivated by the design of recent optimizers like Muon (Jordan et al., 2024), we explicitly aim to minimize the number of iterations required for these methods without degrading model performance. We show that our implementation of Newton-DB achieves lower validation perplexity than Coupled-Newton and standard Eigen-Value Decomposition when"
