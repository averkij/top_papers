However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because tokenspace similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of policy model and reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives. Experiments across multiple model architectures and tasks show consistent improvements from latent-space regularization. Further, by comparing GANPO-induced inferential biases with those from token-level regularization, we find that GANPO provides more robust structural feedback under distributional shift and noise while maintaining comparable downstream performance with minor computational overhead. 1. Introduction Learning from human feedback is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences (Leike et al., 2018; Ouyang et al., 2022). Most modern methods are done via pairwise preference optimization (PO): given pairwise preference data, we update policy model πθ while constraining it to remain close to reference model πref. This regularization constraint is crucial for improving 1Department of Computer Science, Stanford University 2Siebel School of Computing and Data Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Correspondence to: Enyi Jiang <enyij2@illinois.edu, enyij@stanford.edu>. Preprint. January 30, 2026. generalization and reducing reward hacking, and it is most commonly implemented via KL regularizer (Ouyang et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2024). Recent work has also explored alternative divergence measures, e.g., χ2-divergence and other -divergences (Wang et al., 2023a; Huang et al., 2025). However, limitation of these regularizers is that they operate purely in token space. Two sentences, for example, may be distant under token-level divergences while remaining semantically very similar (Hi there vs Good morning to you) and vice versa (Hi there vs Hit there), as illustrated in Figure 2. As result, token-space divergences can be coarse proxy for the actual behavioral similarity. Motivated by the limitation of token space optimization, recent work begun to explore the use of latent spaces instead of token spaces. For example, studies on continuous latent reasoning suggest that optimization in latent representations can lead to improved reasoning capabilities (Hao et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025) compared to methods that purely operate in token space. This paper investigates regularization performed in the latent space: we show that latent regularization can provide structural alignment feedback, which is absent from tokenlevel constraints. Concretely, given preference dataset, we consider the distributions of internal representations produced by the policy model and the reference model, and penalize their divergence. Latent representations are lowerdimensional than token distributions and often encode dense, structured information about semantics and reasoning state. This makes latent regularization potentially better way for semantic alignment than explicit token-level constraints. The immediate challenge is that, unlike token probabilities, latent representations do not admit an explicit probability density, making standard divergence measures computational challenge. To address this, we adopt technique inspired by GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014): we introduce discriminators that distinguish representations generated by the policy from those generated by the reference model. We show that optimizing the policy against such discriminators is equivalent to minimizing latent-space divergence, yielding an efficient adversarial regularizer that can be added to existing preference optimization objectives. To fully leverage paired preference signals, we move beyond the standard Latent Adversarial Regularization for Offline Preference Optimization Figure 1. Comparison between DPO and GANPO. Offline preference optimization methods (e.g., DPO) optimize an implicit reward defined by preference data. GANPO augments this objective with latent-space discriminator, whose adversarial interaction induces regularization between the latent representation distributions of the policy model and the reference model. models internal representation space, yielding improved robustness to stochastic sampling noise and distributional shifts. Moreover, GANPO maintains comparable performance on downstream tasks with modest additional computational overhead. 2. Preliminaries 2.1. Preference Optimization In modern language-model alignment, preference learning is commonly instantiated through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022) by optimizing KL-regularized reward objective. For parameter β > 0, this objective is given by max πθ r(πθ) β DKL(πθ πref ), (1) where r(πθ) := ExD,yπθ(x)[r(x, y)] denotes the expected reward of the policy over the data distribution D, and DKL(πθ πref ) := ExD[DKL(πθ(x) πref (x))] is the expected KL between the policy and reference distribution. In many practical settings, the available supervision is offline and pairwise: dataset consisting of preference triplets (x, yw, yl), representing prompt x, chosen response yw, and rejected response yl. Preference optimization methods working with such offline datasets are referred to as offline preference optimization (OPO). standard approach of OPO is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023b). DPO uses the analytical solution to the KL-regularized RLHF objective (equation 1) to remove the explicit reward function. Instead, the reward r(x, y) is implicitly reparameterized in terms of the optimal policy πθ and the reference policy πref. To model human preferences, DPO incorporates this formulation into the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley & Terry, 19"

Researchers developed a method to overcome sink-collapse in autoregressive video generation by addressing the conflict between Rotary Position Embedding and multi-head attention mechanisms, enabling real-time streaming of videos up to 12 hours long.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent research in long-form video generation has shifted from bidirectional to autoregressive models, yet these methods commonly suffer from error accumulation and a loss of long-term coherence. While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation.

GANPO uses latent-space regularization through adversarial divergence minimization to improve language model preference optimization, offering more robust structural feedback than token-level methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Learning from human feedback typically relies on preference optimization that constrains policy updates through token-level regularization. However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because token-space similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives. Experiments across multiple model architectures and tasks show consistent improvements from latent-space regularization. Further, by comparing GANPO-induced inferential biases with those from token-level regularization, we find that GANPO provides more robust structural feedback under distributional shift and noise while maintaining comparable downstream performance with minor computational overhead.

"GANPO uses latent-space regularization through adversarial divergence minimization to improve language model preference optimization, offering more robust structural feedback than token-level methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Learning from human feedback typically relies on preference optimization that constrains policy updates through token-level regularization. However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because token-space similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives. Experiments across multiple model architectures and tasks show consistent improvements from latent-space regularization. Further, by comparing GANPO-induced inferential biases with those from token-level regularization, we find that GANPO provides more robust structural feedback under distributional shift and noise while maintaining comparable downstream performance with minor computational overhead."
