Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation particularly in safety-critical domains.Since the industrial revolution, skills in the labor market have continually shifted in response to the introduction of new technology; the role of workers often shifts from performing the task to supervising the task [Autor et al., 2001]. For example, the automation of factory robots has enabled humans to move from manual labor to supervision, and accounting software has enabled professionals to move from performing raw calculations to identifying better bookkeeping and tax strategies. In both scenarios, humans are responsible for the quality of the final product and are liable for any errors [Bleher and Braun, 2022]. Even as automation changes the process of completing tasks, technical knowledge to identify and fix errors remains extremely important. As AI promises to be catalyst for automation and productivity in wide range of applications, from software engineering to entrepreneurship [DellAcqua et al., 2023, Peng et al., 2023, Cui et al., 2024, Otis et al., 2024, Brynjolfsson et al., 2025], the impacts of AI on the labor force are not yet fully understood. Although more workers rely on AI to improve their productivity, it is unclear whether the use of AI assistance in the workplace might hinder core understanding of concepts or prevent the development of skills necessary to supervise automated tasks. Although most studies have focused on the end product of AI assistance (e.g., lines of code written, quality of ideas proposed), an equally important, if not more crucial question is how process of receiving AI assistance impacts workers. As humans rely on AI for skills such as brainstorming, writing, and general critical thinking, the development of these skills may be significantly altered depending on how AI assistance is used. Software engineering, in particular, has been identified as profession in which AI tools can be readily applied and AI assistance significantly improves productivity in daily tasks [Peng et al., 2023, Cui et al., 2024]. Junior or novice workers, in particicular, benefit most from AI assistance when writing code. In high-stakes applications, AI written code may be debugged and tested by humans before piece of software is ready for deployment. This additional verification that enhances safety is only possible when human engineers themselves have the skills to understand code and identify errors. As AI development progresses, the problem of supervising more and more capable AI systems becomes more difficult if humans have weaker abilities Work done as part of the Anthropic Fellows Program, judy@anthropic.com Anthropic, atamkin@anthropic.com 1 Figure 1: Overview of results: (Left) We find significant decrease in library-specific skills (conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging) among workers using AI assistance for completing tasks with new python library. (Right) We categorize AI usage patterns and found three high skill development patterns where participants stay cognitively engaged when using AI assistance. to understand code [Bowman et al., 2022]. When complex software tasks require human-AI collaboration, humans still need to understand the basic concepts of code development even if their software skills are complementary to the strengths of AI [Wang et al., 2020]. The combination of persistent competency requirements in high-stakes settings and demonstrated productivity gains from AI assistance makes software engineering an ideal testbed for studying how AI affects skill formation. We investigate whether using and relying on AI affects the development of software engineering skills [Handa et al., 2025]. Based on the rapid adoption of AI for software engineering, we are motivated by the scenario of engineers acquiring new skills on the job. Although the use of AI tools may improve productivity for these engineers, would they also inhibit skill formation? More specifically, does an AI-assisted task completion workflow prevent engineers from gaining in-depth knowledge about the tools used to complete these tasks? We run randomized experiments that measure skill formation by asking participants to complete coding tasks with new library that they have not used before. This represents one way in which engineers acquire and learn new skills, since new libraries are frequently introduced in languages such as Python. We then evaluate their competency with the new library. Our main research questions are (1) whether AI improves productivity for coding task requiring new concepts and skills, and (2) whether this use of AI reduces the level of understanding of these new concepts and skills.Motivated by the salient setting of AI and software skills, we design coding task and evaluation around relatively new asynchronous Python library and conduct randomized experiments to understand the impact of AI assistance on task completion time and skill development. We find that using AI assistance to complete tasks that involve this new library resulted in reduction in the evaluation score by 17% or two grade points (Cohens = 0.738, = 0.010). Meanwhile, we did not find statistically significant acceleration in completion time with AI assistance (Figure 6). Through an in-depth qualitative analysis where we watch th"

AI assistance produces significant productivity gains across professional domains, particularly for novice workers. Yet how this assistance affects the development of skills required to effectively supervise AI remains unclear. Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains.

FP8 quantization techniques for reinforcement learning with large language models address computational and memory bottlenecks through optimized rollout processes and mismatch mitigation strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly bottlenecked by rollout (generation), where long output sequence lengths make attention and KV-cache memory dominate end-to-end step time. FP8 offers an attractive lever for accelerating RL by reducing compute cost and memory traffic during rollout, but applying FP8 in RL introduces unique engineering and algorithmic challenges: policy weights change every step (requiring repeated quantization and weight synchronization into the inference engine) and low-precision rollouts can deviate from the higher-precision policy assumed by the trainer, causing train-inference mismatch and potential instability. This report presents a practical FP8 rollout stack for LLM RL, implemented in the veRL ecosystem with support for common training backends (e.g., FSDP/Megatron-LM) and inference engines (e.g., vLLM/SGLang). We (i) enable FP8 W8A8 linear-layer rollout using blockwise FP8 quantization, (ii) extend FP8 to KV-cache to remove long-context memory bottlenecks via per-step QKV scale recalibration, and (iii) mitigate mismatch using importance-sampling-based rollout correction (token-level TIS/MIS variants). Across dense and MoE models, these techniques deliver up to 44% rollout throughput gains while preserving learning behavior comparable to BF16 baselines.

"FP8 quantization techniques for reinforcement learning with large language models address computational and memory bottlenecks through optimized rollout processes and mismatch mitigation strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly bottlenecked by rollout (generation), where long output sequence lengths make attention and KV-cache memory dominate end-to-end step time. FP8 offers an attractive lever for accelerating RL by reducing compute cost and memory traffic during rollout, but applying FP8 in RL introduces unique engineering and algorithmic challenges: policy weights change every step (requiring repeated quantization and weight synchronization into the inference engine) and low-precision rollouts can deviate from the higher-precision policy assumed by the trainer, causing train-inference mismatch and potential instability. This report presents a practical FP8 rollout stack for LLM RL, implemented in the veRL ecosystem with support for common training backends (e.g., FSDP/Megatron-LM) and inference engines (e.g., vLLM/SGLang). We (i) enable FP8 W8A8 linear-layer rollout using blockwise FP8 quantization, (ii) extend FP8 to KV-cache to remove long-context memory bottlenecks via per-step QKV scale recalibration, and (iii) mitigate mismatch using importance-sampling-based rollout correction (token-level TIS/MIS variants). Across dense and MoE models, these techniques deliver up to 44% rollout throughput gains while preserving learning behavior comparable to BF16 baselines."

Persona prompting affects large language model rationales in socially sensitive tasks by improving classification accuracy but reducing explanation quality while failing to eliminate demographic biases.  					AI-generated summary 				 For socially sensitive tasks like hate speech detection, the quality of explanations from Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for factors like user trust and model alignment. While Persona prompting (PP) is increasingly used as a way to steer model towards user-specific generation, its effect on model rationales remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-generated rationales vary when conditioned on different simulated demographic personas. Using datasets annotated with word-level rationales, we measure agreement with human annotations from different demographic groups, and assess the impact of PP on model bias and human alignment. Our evaluation across three LLMs results reveals three key findings: (1) PP improving classification on the most subjective task (hate speech) but degrading rationale quality. (2) Simulated personas fail to align with their real-world demographic counterparts, and high inter-persona agreement shows models are resistant to significant steering. (3) Models exhibit consistent demographic biases and a strong tendency to over-flag content as harmful, regardless of PP. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: while PP can improve classification in socially-sensitive tasks, it often comes at the cost of rationale quality and fails to mitigate underlying biases, urging caution in its application.
