Text:"JUST-DUB-IT : Video Dubbing via Joint Audio-Visual Diffusion ANTHONY CHEN, Tel Aviv University, Israel and Lightricks, Israel NAOMI KEN KOREM, Lightricks, Israel TAVI HALPERIN, Lightricks, Israel MATAN BEN YOSEF, Lightricks, Israel URSKA JELERCIC, Lightricks, Israel OFIR BIBI, Lightricks, Israel OR PATASHNIK, Tel Aviv University, Israel DANIEL COHEN-OR, Tel Aviv University, Israel 6 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 1 3 4 1 2 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r Audio-Visual Foundation Models, which are pretrained to jointly generate sound and visual content, have recently shown an unprecedented ability to model multi-modal generation and editing, opening new opportunities for downstream tasks. Among these tasks, video dubbing could greatly benefit from such priors, yet most existing solutions still rely on complex, task-specific pipelines that struggle in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce single-model approach that adapts foundational audio-video diffusion model for video-to-video dubbing via lightweight LoRA. The LoRA enables the model to condition on an input audio-video while jointly generating translated audio and synchronized facial motion. To train this LoRA, we leverage the generative model itself to synthesize paired multilingual videos of the same speaker. Specifically, we generate multilingual videos with language switches within single clip, and then inpaint the face and audio in each half to match the language of the other half. By leveraging the rich generative prior of the audio-visual model, our approach preserves speaker identity and lip synchronization while remaining robust to complex motion and real-world dynamics. We demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality dubbed videos with improved visual fidelity, lip synchronization, and robustness compared to existing dubbing pipelines.

Text:"KromHC: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections with Kronecker-Product Residual Matrices Wuyang Zhou 1 Yuxuan Gu 1 Giorgos Iacovides 1 Danilo MandicThe success of Hyper-Connections (HC) in neural networks (NN) has also highlighted issues related to its training instability and restricted scalability. The Manifold-Constrained HyperConnections (mHC) mitigate these challenges by projecting the residual connection space onto Birkhoff polytope, however, it faces two issues: 1) its iterative Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) algorithm does not always yield exact doubly stochastic residual matrices; 2) mHC incurs prohibitive O(n3C) parameter complexity with as the width of the residual stream and as the feature dimension. The recently proposed mHClite reparametrizes the residual matrix via the Birkhoff-von-Neumann theorem to guarantee double stochasticity, but also faces factorial explosion in its parameter complexity, (nC n!). To address both challenges, we propose KromHC, which uses the Kronecker products of smaller doubly stochastic matrices to parametrize the residual matrix in mHC. By enforcing manifold constraints across the factor residual matrices along each mode of the tensorized residual stream, KromHC guarantees exact double stochasticity of the residual matrices while reducing parameter complexity to O(n2C). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that KromHC matches or even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) mHC variants, while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters.

Introduction Hyper-Connections (HC) (Zhu et al., 2025) have emerged as powerful alternative to the ubiquitous residual connections (He et al., 2016). This is achieved by expanding the residual 1Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom. Preprint. January 30, 2026. Table 1.

Our proposed KromHC is the only method that simultaneously achieves exact doubly stochastic residual matrices, parameter efficiency, and requires no specialized kernel optimization. Criterion mHC mHC-lite Doubly Stochastic Parameter Efficient PyTorch Native . . KromHC (Ours) stream width to enhance topological complexity. Unlike the standard residual mapping xl+1 = xl + F(xl) (He et al., 2016), HC increases the stream width by an expansion rate, n, without incurring computational overhead regarding FLOPs. By introducing learnable mixing across the multiple residual streams, HC allows for more expressive feature propagation. More specifically, single layer of HC is defined as Xl+1 = Hres Xl + Hpost (cid:0)Hpre Xl (cid:1) , (1) R1n, and Hpost where Xl RnC and Xl+1 RnC are the expanded Rnn, input and output at the l-th HC layer; Hres Hpre R1n are learnable mappings that, respectively, mix the residual streams, aggregate features from streams into one, and map the layer output back onto the streams; F() is learned residual function such as the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017). }L Recent work (Xie et al., 2025) has suggested that the unconstrained residual matrices ({Hres l=1) in HC can lead to numerical instabilities when training large-scale neural networks (NNs) such as large language models (LLMs). In particular, HC cannot preserve the identity mapping property of the standard residual connections (He et al., 2016) when stacked across multiple layers, as (cid:81)Ll Li fails to preserve the global mean of the features in i=1 Hres (cid:32)Ll (cid:89) (cid:33) Hres Li Xl XL = i=1 L1 (cid:88) + L1i (cid:89) Hpost Hres Lj F(Hpre Xi) , (2) i=l j=1 1 KromHC: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections with Kronecker-Product Residual Matrices Figure 1. Illustration of variants of manifold-constrained hyper-connections with residual stream width = 8. (a) mHC: utilizes iterative Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) algorithm to approximate doubly stochastic residual matrix; (b) mHC-lite: builds the residual matrix as convex combinations of n! permutation matrices, but becomes infeasible for large n; (c) KromHC (Ours): constructs the residual matrix as the Kronecker products of smaller (e.g., 2 2) doubly stochastic matrices, thus guaranteeing double stochasticity while remaining parameter efficient. where and represent deeper and shallower layer, respectively (Xie et al., 2025). To address the training instability issue of HC, authors in Xie et al. (2025) have proposed the Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections, which applies the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm (Sinkhorn & Knopp, 1967) to iteratively project the residual matrices, {Hres l=1, onto the Birkhoff polytope (i.e. the set of doubly stochastic matrices). Since the sum of the individual rows and columns of doubly stochastic matrices is always equal to 1, the residual mixing mapping, Hres Xl, becomes convex combination of the input features, preserving feature mean across layers and regularizing the norm of the residual matrices. }L However, the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm (Sinkhorn & Knopp, 1967) in mHC can fail to achieve double stochasticity when employed over finite number of iterations (e.g., 20 iterations in mHC). This leads to error accumulation across layers and undermines training stability (Xie et al., 2025; Yang & Gao, 2026) (See Figure 2). To this end, Yang & Gao (2026) proposed mHC-lite, which guarantees exact double stochasticity by using the Birkhoff-von-Neumann theorem (Birkhoff, 1946) to parametrize the residual matrices as the convex combinations of permutation matrices. Despite achieving exact doubly stochastic residual matrices, mHC-lite suffers from an explosion in parameter complexity, as it requires n! unique permutation matrices of size nn to be stored. Furthermore, the generic mHC (Xie et al., 2025) has parameter complexity of O(n3C), thus preventing effective scaling of the residual stream width (See Figure 3). Therefore, the following question naturally arises: Can we achieve exact double stochasticity of the residual matrices without incurring an explosion in parameter count as the width of the residual stream, n, increases? 2 KromHC: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections with Kronecker-Product Residual Matrices In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows: Based on the Kronecker product, we propose KromHC, novel manifold-constrained hyper-connection framework, providing link to tensorized residual mixing. We resolve the conflict between exact double stochasticity and parameter"

A lightweight LoRA adaptation of an audio-video diffusion model enables high-quality video dubbing with preserved speaker identity and improved lip synchronization through synthetic multilingual video training.  					AI-generated summary 				 Audio-Visual Foundation Models, which are pretrained to jointly generate sound and visual content, have recently shown an unprecedented ability to model multi-modal generation and editing, opening new opportunities for downstream tasks. Among these tasks, video dubbing could greatly benefit from such priors, yet most existing solutions still rely on complex, task-specific pipelines that struggle in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a single-model approach that adapts a foundational audio-video diffusion model for video-to-video dubbing via a lightweight LoRA. The LoRA enables the model to condition on an input audio-video while jointly generating translated audio and synchronized facial motion. To train this LoRA, we leverage the generative model itself to synthesize paired multilingual videos of the same speaker. Specifically, we generate multilingual videos with language switches within a single clip, and then inpaint the face and audio in each half to match the language of the other half. By leveraging the rich generative prior of the audio-visual model, our approach preserves speaker identity and lip synchronization while remaining robust to complex motion and real-world dynamics. We demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality dubbed videos with improved visual fidelity, lip synchronization, and robustness compared to existing dubbing pipelines.

KromHC addresses training instability and scalability issues in hyper-connections by using Kronecker products to parametrize residual matrices with reduced parameter complexity.  					AI-generated summary 				 The success of Hyper-Connections (HC) in neural networks (NN) has also highlighted issues related to its training instability and restricted scalability. The Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) mitigate these challenges by projecting the residual connection space onto a Birkhoff polytope, however, it faces two issues: 1) its iterative Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) algorithm does not always yield exact doubly stochastic residual matrices; 2) mHC incurs a prohibitive O(n^3C) parameter complexity with n as the width of the residual stream and C as the feature dimension. The recently proposed mHC-lite reparametrizes the residual matrix via the Birkhoff-von-Neumann theorem to guarantee double stochasticity, but also faces a factorial explosion in its parameter complexity, O left( nC cdot n! right). To address both challenges, we propose KromHC, which uses the Kronecker products of smaller doubly stochastic matrices to parametrize the residual matrix in mHC. By enforcing manifold constraints across the factor residual matrices along each mode of the tensorized residual stream, KromHC guarantees exact double stochasticity of the residual matrices while reducing parameter complexity to O(n^2C). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that KromHC matches or even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) mHC variants, while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters.
