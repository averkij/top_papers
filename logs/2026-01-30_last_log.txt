Text:"2026-01-30 Qwen3-ASR Technical Report Qwen Team https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen3-asr https://modelscope.cn/collections/Qwen/Qwen3-ASR https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-ASRIn this report, we introduce Qwen3-ASR family, which includes two powerful all-in-one speech recognition models and novel non-autoregressive speech forced alignment model. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the opensourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracyefficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average time-to-first-token as low as 92ms and transcribe 2,000 seconds speech in 1 second at concurrency of 128. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B is an LLM based NAR timestamp predictor that is able to align text-speech pairs in 11 languages. Timestamp accuracy experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the three strongest force alignment models and takes more advantages in efficiency and versatility. To further accelerate the community research of ASR and audio understanding, we release these models under the Apache 2.0 license.6 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 1 7 3 3 1 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r Figure 1: Qwen3-ASR family includes all-in-one ASR models with advantages in multilingual, noisy speech recognition, singing voice recognition and inference efficiency, so as to novel multilingual speech forced alignment model for predicting timestamps of words or sentences in ASR results. In recent years, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has transitioned from traditional end-to-end (E2E) paradigms, e.g., Transducer (Graves, 2012) and AED (Chan et al., 2016; Radford et al., 2023) to the 1 Large Audio-Language Model (LALM) paradigm. Compared with traditional ASR, this paradigm can take advantage of the language modeling capabilities and world knowledge of large language models. The model first forms high-level understanding of the audio signal and then generates transcription conditioned on this understanding, rather than relying solely on bottom-up acoustic pattern matching. Under this paradigm, issues that are relatively challenging for conventional ASR modelssuch as long-form transcription, robustness to noise, world-knowledge and named-entity recognition, as well as multilingual and dialectal coverage, can be addressed more naturally. In real-world deployments, ASR systems are often required to output timestamps alongside transcripts (e.g., for subtitle generation). Prior work typically performs timestamping as post-processing step using techniques such as CTC or CIF (Kürzinger et al., 2020; Rastorgueva et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023). We would like to highlight that an LALM-based approach can yield more accurate and faster timestamp prediction at arbitrary temporal granularities, and that, by leveraging the multilingual capacity of LALMs, single unified model can provide timestamp alignment across diverse languages. In this report, we present the Qwen3-ASR family, including Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B - two all-in-one ASR models with language identification (LID) ability for 52 languages and dialects, and Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B - the first lightweight LALM-based multilingual forced aligner supporting 11 languages and flexible timestamp prediction granularities. These model are posttrained from the strong foundation model of Qwen3-Omni (Xu et al., 2025a). For evaluating the performance of ASR models on benchmarks out of the open-sourced ones (ASR models at present have reached the limit of annotation errors on several test sets), we build series of internal benchmarks covering more than complex acoustic environment, dialects, elders and kids speech and multilingual. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary commercial APIs. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B offers the best accuracy-model-size trade-off, making it strong choice for on-device deployment. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B delivers highly accurate forced-alignment timestamps and inherits the key capabilities of Qwen3-ASR, including multilingual and long-form speech support, enabling scalable labeling of speech-transcript pairs. The key features and contributions of the proposed Qwen3-ASR family models can be summarized as: Achieves state-of-the-art all-in-one ASR and LID performance. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3ASR-0.6B finely support 30 languages, 22 Chinese dialects ASR, and English from countries and regions worldwide. These two models also conduct robust speech recognition under complex environment, including but not limited to singing voice and song recognition, noise environment recognition and complex text patterns recognition. Presents novel speech force alignment architecture. To the best of our knowledge, we introduce the first Large Language Model based speech forced aligner that produces accurate timestamps at flexible granularities, including word, sentence, and paragraph levels. Compared with forcedalignment models at present including Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) and NeMo Forced Aligner (NFA), Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B fills the gap of an all-in-one, multilingual speech forced alignment solution, and completes an essential function of the Qwen3-ASR family. Open-sourced weights, powerful inference and finetune framework. Except weights of the 3 released models, we also open-source complete and easy-using code base for inference with multiple features as well as finetuning recipe. We hope this unified toolkit facilitates the research and development of the ASR community.2.1 Architecture Qwen3-ASR famliy models leverage Qwen3-Omni as foundation model, which proved to obtain strong audio understanding ability Xu et al. (2025b). Speech to recognize is first fed to AuT encoder, which is pretrained separately from Qwen3-Omni and Qwen3-ASR. As illustrated in Figure 2(left), AuT is an attention-encoder-decoder (AED) based ASR model which conducts 8 times downsampling to Fbank feature "

Text:"6 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 1 0 2 4 1 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r ConceptMoE: Adaptive Token-to-Concept Compression for Implicit Compute Allocation Zihao Huang, Jundong Zhou, Xingwei Qu, Qiyang Min, Ge ZhangMain authors, Corresponding authorsLarge language models allocate uniform computation across all tokens, ignoring that some sequences are trivially predictable while others require deep reasoning. We introduce ConceptMoE, which dynamically merges semantically similar tokens into concept representations, performing implicit token-level compute allocation. learnable chunk module identifies optimal boundaries by measuring inter-token similarity, compressing sequences by target ratio before they enter the compute-intensive concept model. Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: we reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs (excluding attention map computation) and total parameters, isolating genuine architectural benefits. Under these conditions, ConceptMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE across language and vision-language tasks, achieving +0.9 points on language pretraining, +2.3 points on long context understanding, and +0.6 points on multimodal benchmarks. When converting pretrained MoE during continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points, demonstrating practical applicability. Beyond performance, ConceptMoE reduces attention computation by up to R2 and KV cache by R. At = 2, empirical measurements show prefill speedups reaching 175% and decoding speedups up to 117% on long sequences. The minimal architectural modifications enable straightforward integration into existing MoE, demonstrating that adaptive concept-level processing fundamentally improves both effectiveness and efficiency of large language models. Date: January 30, 2026 Correspondence: huangzihao.notabot@bytedance.com Code Page: https://github.com/ZihaoHuang-notabot/ConceptMoELarge language models (LLMs) process text uniformly at the token level, allocating equal computation to every position in the sequence. Yet not all tokens carry equal semantic weight: while some represent pivotal concepts requiring deep reasoning, others are trivially predictable from context. This one-size-fits-all approach wastes substantial computation on routine predictions while potentially under-resourcing semantically dense content. The natural question emerges: can we move beyond fixed token-level processing toward adaptive concept-level computation? Traditional approaches to enriching semantic content while reducing token count focus on vocabulary expansion. Recent work [33] shows that larger vocabularies consistently improve LLM performance by compressing text into fewer, information-denser tokens. However, the gains are limited: 100 vocabulary expansion yields 1 only 1.3 compression. The computational cost of massive vocabularies during training and inference makes further scaling impractical. An alternative paradigm is dynamic token merging within the model. Several studies [7, 30] merge consecutive tokens into higher-level concepts without vocabulary expansion, but use fixed-length or rule-based strategies that cannot adapt to varying information density. Byte-level transformers [31, 36, 40] explore adaptive chunking [19, 26], yet lack precise parameter control and introduce confounding factors through input representation changes. Moreover, most evaluations on dense models compensate reduced token count by scaling depth or width, conflating architectural benefits with parameter increases. We introduce ConceptMoE, which elevates LLM processing from the token level to the concept level through learnable adaptive chunking. The core insight is straightforward: consecutive tokens with high semantic similarity merge into unified concept representations, while semantically distinct tokens maintain fine-grained granularity. learnable chunk module identifies optimal boundaries by measuring inter-token similarity, compressing sequences before they enter the compute-intensive concept model. This naturally performs implicit compute allocation - predictable token sequences merge and process efficiently, while complex tokens preserve detailed computation. Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: by reallocating saved computation to match baseline FLOPs while maintaining identical total parameters, we isolate genuine architectural benefits from concept-level processing. Our key contributions are: Fair architectural comparison under controlled conditions. Unlike dense models, MoE allows adjusting activated parameters independently of total parameters. By reallocating computation saved from token reduction, we compare ConceptMoE against standard MoE under identical total parameters and average per-token FLOPs, isolating genuine architectural benefits. We explore three compute reallocation strategies and demonstrate consistent improvements across all configurations. Versatile application across training paradigms. We demonstrate ConceptMoEs effectiveness across diverse settings: small-scale language model pretraining (Section 4.1), vision-language model training with dual-modality compression (Section 4.2), and lossless conversion from pretrained MoE during continual training (Section 4.3). The CT conversion achieves +5.5 points improvement while enabling direct inference speedup, with from-scratch training reaching +6.4 points overall. Inherent efficiency advantages under compute matching. Even after reallocating saved FLOPs, given compression ratio R, ConceptMoE reduces attention map computation by up to R2 and KV cache by up to  (Table 1)  . Empirical results show prefill speedups up to 175% and decoding speedups up to 117% on long sequences under = 2, validating both superior performance and efficiency. Minimal architectural intrusion for practical adoption. ConceptMoE requires only lightweight chunk module and minor decoder modifications (additional QKV projectors in the last 4 layers), making it straightforward to integrate into existing MoE architectures for both pretraining and continual training scenarios. ConceptMoE demonstrates paradigm shift from uniform token-level to adaptive concept-level processing, fundamentally improving both effectiveness and efficiency of LLMs.Vocabulary size determines the information capacity of each token in LLMs, typically ranging from 32K to 256K. Larger vocabularies enable higher compression efficiency and fewer tokens per sequence. Tao e"

Text:"Self-Improving Pretraining: using post-trained models to pretrain better models Ellen Xiaoqing Tan, Shehzaad Dhuliawala, Jing Xu, Ping Yu, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Jason Weston, Olga Golovneva Ensuring safety, factuality and overall quality in the generations of large language models is critical challenge, especially as these models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes models core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next generated tokens at each step. strong, post-trained model judges candidate generationsincluding model rollouts, the original suffix, and rewritten suffixfor quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.

Text:"Segment Length Matters: Study of Segment Lengths on Audio Fingerprinting Performance Ziling Gong Data Science Institute Columbia University New York, USA zg2532@columbia.edu Yunyan Ouyang Data Science Institute Columbia University New York, USA yo2384@columbia.edu Iram Kamdar Data Science Institute Columbia University New York, USA ik2594@columbia.edu Melody Ma Data Science Institute Columbia University New York, USA ym3065@columbia.edu Hongjie Chen Dolby Laboratories Atlanta, USA 0000-0002-8755Franck Dernoncourt* Adobe Research Seattle, USA dernonco@adobe.com Ryan A. Rossi* Adobe Research San Jose, USA ryrossi@adobe.com Nesreen K. Ahmed Cisco Research San Jose, USA nesahmed@cisco.com AbstractAudio fingerprinting provides an identifiable representation of acoustic signals, which can be later used for identification and retrieval systems. To obtain discriminative representation, the input audio is usually segmented into shorter time intervals, allowing local acoustic features to be extracted and analyzed. Modern neural approaches typically operate on short, fixed-duration audio segments, yet the choice of segment duration is often made heuristically and rarely examined in depth. In this paper, we study how segment length affects audio fingerprinting performance. We extend an existing neural fingerprinting architecture to adopt various segment lengths and evaluate retrieval accuracy across different segment lengths and query durations. Our results show that short segment lengths (0.5-second) generally achieve better performance. Moreover, we evaluate LLM capacity in recommending the best segment length, which shows that GPT-5-mini consistently gives the best suggestions across five considerations among three studied LLMs. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting segment duration in large-scale neural audio retrieval systems.

The Qwen3-ASR family introduces speech recognition models with language identification capabilities and a non-autoregressive forced alignment model, achieving state-of-the-art performance and efficient processing.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this report, we introduce Qwen3-ASR family, which includes two powerful all-in-one speech recognition models and a novel non-autoregressive speech forced alignment model. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B is an LLM based NAR timestamp predictor that is able to align text-speech pairs in 11 languages. Timestamp accuracy experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the three strongest force alignment models and takes more advantages in efficiency and versatility. To further accelerate the community research of ASR and audio understanding, we release these models under the Apache 2.0 license.

ConceptMoE dynamically allocates computation by merging similar tokens into concept representations, improving both performance and efficiency in large language models through adaptive processing and reduced attention computation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models allocate uniform computation across all tokens, ignoring that some sequences are trivially predictable while others require deep reasoning. We introduce ConceptMoE, which dynamically merges semantically similar tokens into concept representations, performing implicit token-level compute allocation. A learnable chunk module identifies optimal boundaries by measuring inter-token similarity, compressing sequences by a target ratio R before they enter the compute-intensive concept model. Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: we reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs (excluding attention map computation) and total parameters, isolating genuine architectural benefits. Under these conditions, ConceptMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE across language and vision-language tasks, achieving +0.9 points on language pretraining, +2.3 points on long context understanding, and +0.6 points on multimodal benchmarks. When converting pretrained MoE during continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points, demonstrating practical applicability. Beyond performance, ConceptMoE reduces attention computation by up to R^2times and KV cache by Rtimes. At R=2, empirical measurements show prefill speedups reaching 175\% and decoding speedups up to 117\% on long sequences. The minimal architectural modifications enable straightforward integration into existing MoE, demonstrating that adaptive concept-level processing fundamentally improves both effectiveness and efficiency of large language models.

A reinforcement learning-based pretraining method improves language model safety, factuality, and quality by evaluating generations through a combination of model rollouts, original suffixes, and rewritten suffixes.  					AI-generated summary 				 Ensuring safety, factuality and overall quality in the generations of large language models is a critical challenge, especially as these models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.

Embedding scaling offers superior sparsity scaling compared to expert scaling in large language models, enabling efficient inference through system optimizations and speculative decoding.  					AI-generated summary 				 While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the standard for sparsity scaling in large language models, they increasingly face diminishing returns and system-level bottlenecks. In this work, we explore embedding scaling as a potent, orthogonal dimension for scaling sparsity. Through a comprehensive analysis and experiments, we identify specific regimes where embedding scaling achieves a superior Pareto frontier compared to expert scaling. We systematically characterize the critical architectural factors governing this efficacy -- ranging from parameter budgeting to the interplay with model width and depth. Moreover, by integrating tailored system optimizations and speculative decoding, we effectively convert this sparsity into tangible inference speedups. Guided by these insights, we introduce LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model with ~3B activated trained from scratch. Despite allocating over 30B parameters to embeddings, LongCat-Flash-Lite not only surpasses parameter-equivalent MoE baselines but also exhibits exceptional competitiveness against existing models of comparable scale, particularly in agentic and coding domains.

"Embedding scaling offers superior sparsity scaling compared to expert scaling in large language models, enabling efficient inference through system optimizations and speculative decoding.  					AI-generated summary 				 While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the standard for sparsity scaling in large language models, they increasingly face diminishing returns and system-level bottlenecks. In this work, we explore embedding scaling as a potent, orthogonal dimension for scaling sparsity. Through a comprehensive analysis and experiments, we identify specific regimes where embedding scaling achieves a superior Pareto frontier compared to expert scaling. We systematically characterize the critical architectural factors governing this efficacy -- ranging from parameter budgeting to the interplay with model width and depth. Moreover, by integrating tailored system optimizations and speculative decoding, we effectively convert this sparsity into tangible inference speedups. Guided by these insights, we introduce LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model with ~3B activated trained from scratch. Despite allocating over 30B parameters to embeddings, LongCat-Flash-Lite not only surpasses parameter-equivalent MoE baselines but also exhibits exceptional competitiveness against existing models of comparable scale, particularly in agentic and coding domains."

Neural audio fingerprinting performance varies with segment length, with short segments (0.5-second) generally providing better retrieval accuracy, and large language models showing promise in recommending optimal segment durations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Audio fingerprinting provides an identifiable representation of acoustic signals, which can be later used for identification and retrieval systems. To obtain a discriminative representation, the input audio is usually segmented into shorter time intervals, allowing local acoustic features to be extracted and analyzed. Modern neural approaches typically operate on short, fixed-duration audio segments, yet the choice of segment duration is often made heuristically and rarely examined in depth. In this paper, we study how segment length affects audio fingerprinting performance. We extend an existing neural fingerprinting architecture to adopt various segment lengths and evaluate retrieval accuracy across different segment lengths and query durations. Our results show that short segment lengths (0.5-second) generally achieve better performance. Moreover, we evaluate LLM capacity in recommending the best segment length, which shows that GPT-5-mini consistently gives the best suggestions across five considerations among three studied LLMs. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting segment duration in large-scale neural audio retrieval systems.

PRISM leverages design data to create a knowledge base for improving graphic designs based on natural language instructions, achieving superior style alignment compared to existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Graphic design often involves exploring different stylistic directions, which can be time-consuming for non-experts. We address this problem of stylistically improving designs based on natural language instructions. While VLMs have shown initial success in graphic design, their pretrained knowledge on styles is often too general and misaligned with specific domain data. For example, VLMs may associate minimalism with abstract designs, whereas designers emphasize shape and color choices. Our key insight is to leverage design data -- a collection of real-world designs that implicitly capture designer's principles -- to learn design knowledge and guide stylistic improvement. We propose PRISM (PRior-Informed Stylistic Modification) that constructs and applies a design knowledge base through three stages: (1) clustering high-variance designs to capture diversity within a style, (2) summarizing each cluster into actionable design knowledge, and (3) retrieving relevant knowledge during inference to enable style-aware improvement. Experiments on the Crello dataset show that PRISM achieves the highest average rank of 1.49 (closer to 1 is better) over baselines in style alignment. User studies further validate these results, showing that PRISM is consistently preferred by designers.
