Text:"6 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 1 1 0 1 2 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r ECO: Quantized Training without Full-Precision Master Weights Mahdi Nikdan1,2, Amir Zandieh1, Dan Alistarh2 and Vahab Mirrokni1 1Google Research, 2ISTA Quantization has significantly improved the compute and memory efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) training. However, existing approaches still rely on accumulating their updates in high-precision: concretely, gradient updates must be applied to high-precision weight buffer, known as master weights. This buffer introduces substantial memory overhead, particularly for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) models, where model parameters and optimizer states dominate memory usage. To address this, we introduce the Error-Compensating Optimizer (ECO), which eliminates master weights by applying updates directly to quantized parameters. ECO quantizes weights after each step and carefully injects the resulting quantization error into the optimizer momentum, forming an error-feedback loop with no additional memory. We prove that, under standard assumptions and decaying learning rate, ECO converges to constant-radius neighborhood of the optimum, while naive master-weight removal can incur an error that is inversely proportional to the learning rate. We show empirical results for pretraining small Transformers (30800M), Gemma-3 1B model, and 2.1B parameter Sparse MoE model with FP8 quantization, and fine-tuning DeepSeek-MoE-16B in INT4 precision. Throughout, ECO matches baselines with master weights up to near-lossless accuracy, significantly shifting the static memory vs validation loss Pareto frontier. 1. Introduction Scaling Large Language Model (LLM) training comes with substantial computational and memory costs. As models have grown from billions to trillions of parameters, training memory has become central bottleneck. Low-precision training has therefore emerged as practical direction: recent FP8 (Liu et al., 2024a; Peng et al., 2023), and even lower precision (Panferov et al."

AgentLongBench evaluates large language models as autonomous agents through dynamic environment interactions, revealing challenges in handling high-information-density tool responses compared to memory fragmentation in long conversations.  					AI-generated summary 				 The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents necessitates the management of extensive, dynamic contexts. Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce AgentLongBench, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues.

Error-compensating optimizer eliminates memory overhead from master weights in quantized LLM training while maintaining near-lossless accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Quantization has significantly improved the compute and memory efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) training. However, existing approaches still rely on accumulating their updates in high-precision: concretely, gradient updates must be applied to a high-precision weight buffer, known as master weights. This buffer introduces substantial memory overhead, particularly for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) models, where model parameters and optimizer states dominate memory usage. To address this, we introduce the Error-Compensating Optimizer (ECO), which eliminates master weights by applying updates directly to quantized parameters. ECO quantizes weights after each step and carefully injects the resulting quantization error into the optimizer momentum, forming an error-feedback loop with no additional memory. We prove that, under standard assumptions and a decaying learning rate, ECO converges to a constant-radius neighborhood of the optimum, while naive master-weight removal can incur an error that is inversely proportional to the learning rate. We show empirical results for pretraining small Transformers (30-800M), a Gemma-3 1B model, and a 2.1B parameter Sparse MoE model with FP8 quantization, and fine-tuning DeepSeek-MoE-16B in INT4 precision. Throughout, ECO matches baselines with master weights up to near-lossless accuracy, significantly shifting the static memory vs validation loss Pareto frontier.

  "desc": "В статье предлагается Error-Compensating Optimizer (ECO) — новый оптимизатор, который решает проблему высокого потребления памяти при обучении квантованных больших языковых моделей. Ключевое нововведение заключается в том, что ECO избавляется от буфера высокоточных весов (master weights) и применяет обновления градиентов непосредственно к квантованным параметрам. Алгоритм компенсирует ошибки квантизации, внедряя их в импульс оптимизатора, создавая замкнутый цикл обратной связи без дополнительных затрат памяти. Авторы доказали, что ECO сходится к оптимуму с гарантированной точностью и продемонстрировали результаты на моделях размером от 30М до 16B параметров с квантизацией FP8 и INT4.",
