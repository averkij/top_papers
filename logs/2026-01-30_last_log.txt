Text:"Darshan Deshpande 1 Anand Kannappan 1 Rebecca Qian 1 6 2 0 2 7 2 ] . [ 1 3 0 1 0 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r aRecent advances in reinforcement learning for code generation have made robust environments essential to prevent reward hacking. As LLMs increasingly serve as evaluators in code-based RL, their ability to detect reward hacking remains understudied. In this paper, we propose novel taxonomy of reward exploits spanning across 54 categories and introduce TRACE (Testing Reward Anomalies in Code Environments), synthetically curated and human-verified benchmark containing 517 testing trajectories. Unlike prior work that evaluates reward hack detection in isolated classification scenarios, we contrast these evaluations with more realistic, contrastive anomaly detection setup on TRACE. Our experiments reveal that models capture reward hacks more effectively in contrastive settings than in isolated classification settings, with GPT-5.2 with highest reasoning mode achieving the best Detection Rate at 63%, up from 45% in isolated settings on TRACE. Building on this insight, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art models struggle significantly more with semantically contextualized reward hacks compared to syntactically contextualized ones. We further conduct qualitative analyses of model behaviors, as well as ablation studies showing that the ratio of benign to hacked trajectories and analysis cluster sizes substantially impact detection performance. We release the benchmark and evaluation harness to enable the community to expand TRACE and evaluate their models 1. 1. Introduction Recent works showcasing RL techniques have shown multifold improvements in the reasoning (Guo et al., 2025), 1Patronus AI, California, USA. Correspondence to: Darshan Deshpande <darshan@patronus.ai>. Copyright 2026 by the author(s). 1https://huggingface.co/datasets/ PatronusAI/trace-dataset 1 math (Shao et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2023), coding (Wang et al., 2024) and model safety (Li et al., 2025) domains when supplemented with verifiable rewards. This type of training frequently uses specially curated environments (Zeng et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025) that might be susceptible to reward hacking. Reward hacking arises when agents exploit flaws in their reward function to achieve high scores without fulfilling the underlying objective (Skalse et al., 2022; Pan et al., 2022). Studying reward hacking has become increasingly urgent as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the dominant alignment technique for large language models (Casper et al., 2023), and as agentic AI systems have begun exhibiting sophisticated gaming behaviors, including reward tampering, sycophancy and misleading (Zhong et al., 2025a; Shihab et al., 2025). Specifically in the coding domain, reward hacking has been observed in several cases modifying unit tests, tampering with evaluation code, and exploiting loopholes in task environments (Taylor et al., 2025; Gabor et al., 2025; Zhong et al., 2025b). The severity and downstream impact of such behaviors makes reward hacking in the coding domain an important topic. Recent developments in using LLMs as training orchestrators and dynamic reward function generators (Bhambri et al., 2024) display that scalable training using synthetic reward functions is feasible and promising. However, the lack of human supervision for such techniques necessitates an automatic but careful vetting of reward functions and thorough benchmarking of models for reliable detection of hacking behaviors. In this paper, we propose scalable method to generate high quality, domain specific synthetic reward hack trajectories to help solve this issue. On similar lines, since human supervision is not scalable, several attempts have been made to automate the detection of such hacks. Recent works from Gabor et al. (2025); Zhong et al. (2025b) have focused on small subset of hacks such as test case modification and have been limited by the ability to obtain or induce hacking patterns in naturally occurring model trajectories. Furthermore, these works treat reward hacking as an isolated binary detection problem which differs from the more human-like anomaly detection treatment (Pan et al., 2022). Benchmarking Reward Hack Detection in Code Environments via Contrastive Analysis Figure 1. Three shortened examples showcasing typical reward-hacked trajectories alongside agent and user behaviors in TRACE. The trajectory summaries display Test Targeting, Timeout Manipulation and Interrupt Handling reward hack types respectively. For reliably benchmarking fine grained code-based reward hack trajectories, we propose TRACE, dataset that covers 54 fine grained subcategories spanning across major categories such as test suite exploitation, solution quality degradation, context exploitation and execution environment hacks. Through this dataset, we aim to study the following research questions: 1. How do state-of-the-art open and closed source LLMs perform at detecting reward hacks in the domaindiverse coding trajectories in TRACE? How does this performance compare to humans? 2. Do state-of-the-art models struggle more with detection of semantically contextualized or syntactically contextualized reward hacks? 3. How does contrastive noise in trajectory cluster influence reward detectability? Through our experimentation, we find that the best performing model, GPT-5.2 (OpenAI, 2025) with high reasoning is only able to detect 63% of all hacks present in TRACE. State-of-the-art LLMs struggle significantly more at semantically contextualized reward hacks in the coding domain than syntactic hacks. This pattern is dissimilar to humans and we find that humans show strong performance at grounding hacks both semantically and syntactically. Additionally, we observe that increasing contrasting examples in the analyzed cluster improves this grounding in LLMs. Finally, we perform careful ablations to show that the frequency of reward hacks in cluster strongly impact model performance. We observe that the presence of more benign trajectories in cluster helps the model disentangle reward hack patterns from benign patterns and thereby improves detection performance. 2.

Researchers developed a comprehensive benchmark for detecting reward hacking in code generation environments, demonstrating that contrastive anomaly detection outperforms isolated classification approaches and revealing challenges with semantically contextualized reward hacks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in reinforcement learning for code generation have made robust environments essential to prevent reward hacking. As LLMs increasingly serve as evaluators in code-based RL, their ability to detect reward hacking remains understudied. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy of reward exploits spanning across 54 categories and introduce TRACE (Testing Reward Anomalies in Code Environments), a synthetically curated and human-verified benchmark containing 517 testing trajectories. Unlike prior work that evaluates reward hack detection in isolated classification scenarios, we contrast these evaluations with a more realistic, contrastive anomaly detection setup on TRACE. Our experiments reveal that models capture reward hacks more effectively in contrastive settings than in isolated classification settings, with GPT-5.2 with highest reasoning mode achieving the best detection rate at 63%, up from 45% in isolated settings on TRACE. Building on this insight, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art models struggle significantly more with semantically contextualized reward hacks compared to syntactically contextualized ones. We further conduct qualitative analyses of model behaviors, as well as ablation studies showing that the ratio of benign to hacked trajectories and analysis cluster sizes substantially impact detection performance. We release the benchmark and evaluation harness to enable the community to expand TRACE and evaluate their models.

Исследование показало, что современные LLM-модели намного хуже справляются с семантически контекстуализированными манипуляциями по сравнению с синтаксическими аналогами.
