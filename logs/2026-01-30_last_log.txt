PLANING introduces loosely coupled triangle-Gaussian representation for streaming 3D reconstruction, balancing geometric accuracy, high-fidelity rendering, and computational efficiency. Building upon this hybrid representation, we further adapt it to an efficient streaming reconstruction framework for monocular image sequences, enabling effective modeling of both scene geometry and appearance in streaming setting. Leveraging the inherent edge-preserving property of triangle primitives, our method allows for the explicit extraction of compact planar structures, which can serve as high-performance simulation environment for locomotion training in embodied AI.

[ 1 8 5 1 2 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r Figure 1. The pixel MeanFlow (pMF) formulation, driven by the manifold hypothesis. (Left): Following MeanFlow (Geng et al., 2025a), pMF aims to approximate the average velocity field u(zt, r, t) induced by the underlying ODE trajectory (black). We define new field x(zt, r, t) zt u(zt, r, t), which behaves like denoised images. We hypothesize that approximately lies on low-dimensional data manifold (orange curve) and can therefore be more accurately approximated by neural network. (Right): Visualization of the quantities zt, u, obtained by tracking an ODE trajectory via simulation. The average velocity field corresponds to noisy images and is inevitably higher-dimensional; the induced field corresponds to approximately clean or blurred images, which can be easier to model by neural network. Abstract Modern diffusion/flow-based models for image generation typically exhibit two core characteristics: (i) using multi-step sampling, and (ii) operating in latent space. Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take further step towards this goal and propose pixel MeanFlow (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling key missing piece in this regime.

PLANING presents an efficient streaming reconstruction framework that combines explicit geometric primitives with neural Gaussians to achieve high-quality rendering and accurate geometry simultaneously through decoupled optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Streaming reconstruction from monocular image sequences remains challenging, as existing methods typically favor either high-quality rendering or accurate geometry, but rarely both. We present PLANING, an efficient on-the-fly reconstruction framework built on a hybrid representation that loosely couples explicit geometric primitives with neural Gaussians, enabling geometry and appearance to be modeled in a decoupled manner. This decoupling supports an online initialization and optimization strategy that separates geometry and appearance updates, yielding stable streaming reconstruction with substantially reduced structural redundancy. PLANING improves dense mesh Chamfer-L2 by 18.52% over PGSR, surpasses ARTDECO by 1.31 dB PSNR, and reconstructs ScanNetV2 scenes in under 100 seconds, over 5x faster than 2D Gaussian Splatting, while matching the quality of offline per-scene optimization.

Pixel MeanFlow introduces a one-step latent-free image generation method by separating network output space from loss space, achieving strong performance on ImageNet at multiple resolutions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Modern diffusion/flow-based models for image generation typically exhibit two core characteristics: (i) using multi-step sampling, and (ii) operating in a latent space. Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose "pixel MeanFlow" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models.

HALO enables efficient conversion of Transformer models to RNN-attention hybrid architectures with improved long-context performance using minimal training data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Hybrid Transformer architectures, which combine softmax attention blocks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have shown a desirable performance-throughput tradeoff for long-context modeling, but their adoption and studies are hindered by the prohibitive cost of large-scale pre-training from scratch. Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models. We then present HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with superior length generalization enabled by a novel position encoding scheme (named HyPE) and various architectural modifications. We convert the Qwen3 series into HypeNet using HALO, achieving performance comparable to the original Transformer models while enjoying superior long-context performance and efficiency. The conversion requires just 2.3B tokens, less than 0.01% of their pre-training data

FROST is an attention-aware method that improves reasoning efficiency by pruning uncritical paths and removing reasoning outliers, leading to reduced token usage and improved accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose FROST, an attention-aware method for efficient reasoning. Unlike traditional approaches, FROST leverages attention weights to prune uncritical reasoning paths, yielding shorter and more reliable reasoning trajectories. Methodologically, we introduce the concept of reasoning outliers and design an attention-based mechanism to remove them. Theoretically, FROST preserves and enhances the model's reasoning capacity while eliminating outliers at the sentence level. Empirically, we validate FROST on four benchmarks using two strong reasoning models (Phi-4-Reasoning and GPT-OSS-20B), outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as TALE and ThinkLess. Notably, FROST achieves an average 69.68% reduction in token usage and a 26.70% improvement in accuracy over the base model. Furthermore, in evaluations of attention outlier metrics, FROST reduces the maximum infinity norm by 15.97% and the average kurtosis by 91.09% compared to the base model.

"FROST is an attention-aware method that improves reasoning efficiency by pruning uncritical paths and removing reasoning outliers, leading to reduced token usage and improved accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose FROST, an attention-aware method for efficient reasoning. Unlike traditional approaches, FROST leverages attention weights to prune uncritical reasoning paths, yielding shorter and more reliable reasoning trajectories. Methodologically, we introduce the concept of reasoning outliers and design an attention-based mechanism to remove them. Theoretically, FROST preserves and enhances the model's reasoning capacity while eliminating outliers at the sentence level. Empirically, we validate FROST on four benchmarks using two strong reasoning models (Phi-4-Reasoning and GPT-OSS-20B), outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as TALE and ThinkLess. Notably, FROST achieves an average 69.68% reduction in token usage and a 26.70% improvement in accuracy over the base model. Furthermore, in evaluations of attention outlier metrics, FROST reduces the maximum infinity norm by 15.97% and the average kurtosis by 91.09% compared to the base model.
