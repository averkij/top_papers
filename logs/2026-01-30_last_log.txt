Text:"Reinforcement Learning from Meta-Evaluation: Aligning Language Models Without Ground-Truth Labels Micah Rentschler 1 Jesse Roberts 2 6 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 1 8 6 2 1 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r aMost reinforcement learning (RL) methods for training large language models (LLMs) require ground-truth labels or task-specific verifiers, limiting scalability when correctness is ambiguous or expensive to obtain. We introduce Reinforcement Learning from Meta-Evaluation (RLME), which optimizes generator using reward derived from an evaluators answers to natural-language meta-questions (e.g., Is the answer correct? or Is the reasoning logically consistent?). RLME treats the evaluators probability of positive judgment as reward and updates the generator via group-relative policy optimization, enabling learning without labels. Across suite of experiments, we show that RLME achieves accuracy and sample efficiency comparable to label-based training, enables controllable trade-offs among multiple objectives, steers models toward reliable reasoning patterns rather than post-hoc rationalization, and generalizes to open-domain settings where ground-truth labels are unavailable, broadening the domains in which LLMs may be trained with RL. 1. Introduction Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences or verifiable task outcomes, as in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Kaufmann et al., 2024) and Reinforcement Learning from Verified Rewards (RLVR) (Wen et al., 2025; Yue et al., 2025). These methods work well when high-quality rewards exist, but such signals are costly: human feedback does not scale, and automatic verifiers are typically narrow and domain-specific. In many realistic 1Department of Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville TN, USA 2Department of Computer Science, Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville TN, USA. Correspondence to: Micah Rentschler <micah.d.rentschler@vanderbilt.edu>. Preprint. January 30, 2026. Figure 1. Overview of RLME. After generating an answer, one or more evaluators (may be the same model) assign probabilities to natural-language meta-questions about the output. These probabilities are aggregated into scalar reward, which is then used to update the generative policy via reinforcement learning. This allows models to be tuned even when ground-truth answers are unavailable. settings, ground truth may be uncertain or unavailable. promising alternative is to have the model itself or another model evaluate the response. Prior work leverages model likelihoods of known correct answers as proxy reward (Zhou et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025), but still requires groundtruth labels during training. We instead explore whether models can learn from evaluations provided by an LLM acting as evaluator without access to ground truth labels. To steer the evaluations, we use natural-language prompts applicable over an entire dataset to assess high-level properties of an output which we refer to as meta-questions. For example, Is the answer 5? targets particular problem, whereas Is the answer correct? is broadly applicable meta-question. These are cheap to write, transferable across domains, and empower LLMs to embody heuristics that are difficult to hard-code. This shifts the problem from engineering reward function or handlabeling large dataset to designing meta-questions which elicit desired behavior. introduce Reinforcement Learning from MetaWe Evaluation (RLME), illustrated in Figure 1, and show that Reinforcement Learning from Meta-Evaluation it provides similar results to an RLVR baseline without ground-truth labels. However, meta-evaluation introduces new risks. The model being trained, referred to as the generator, may produce outputs that satisfy the evaluator without genuinely solving the task. The central challenge is therefore to determine when meta-evaluation provides reliable signal and how to mitigate its failure modes. To this end, we contribute the following: RLME, scalable framework that guides modern GRPO-style policy-gradient updates with rewards based on the aggregate probability of target answers to evaluation meta-questions; Empirical evidence that meta-evaluation is competitive with explicit verifiers in reasoning-heavy domains; broad analysis of generator and evaluator choice, self-evaluation, and reward hacking, clarifying both the strengths and failure modes of meta-evaluation; Examples of multi-objective language-driven control; Proof that RLME training encourages contextual faithfulness, generalizing the improved ability to an out-ofdistribution dataset. 2. Related Work Our work connects to several research directions in alignment and reinforcement learning for language models. RLHF and preference-based optimization. RLHF optimizes models using human preference data with PPO-style updates (Kaufmann et al., 2024; Ouyang et al., 2022; Schulman et al., 2017). While this early work was successful and influential, human preference data is expensive and introduces biases such as sycophancy (Sharma et al., 2025). RL from verifiable or probabilistic correctness signals. RLVR-style methods optimize rewards derived from correctness verifiers when ground-truth is available but precise human preference is not (Wen et al., 2025; Shao et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025). VeriFree (Zhou et al., 2025) and RLPR (Yu et al., 2025) further this by using the models own likelihood of the correct answer as proxy reward, but critically, they still require access to ground truth labels. LLM-as-judge and AI feedback. To address the cost of human annotation entirely, RL with AI feedback (RLAIF) methods leverage LLMs as preference evaluators, attempting to replace the preferences that human evaluators would assign with those from an LLM (Zheng et al., 2023; Gu et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024). All of these attempt to predict preference over number of candidate responses. This can inherit potential biases from human raters if they are directly modeled and limit applicability to domains where preference is ill-defined. In contrast to preference-based methods, (Zhao et al., 2025) uses an internal measure of certainty as reward. However, this limits the approach to maximizing self-certainty. Flexible evaluation. Prior work has applied reinforcement learning to refine LLM behavior using variety of feedback signals, but these approaches typically require substantial supervision or are limited to fixed ob"

Reinforcement Learning from Meta-Evaluation optimizes language model generators using rewards from evaluators' judgments on natural-language meta-questions, enabling training without ground-truth labels while achieving comparable accuracy and sample efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods for training large language models (LLMs) require ground-truth labels or task-specific verifiers, limiting scalability when correctness is ambiguous or expensive to obtain. We introduce Reinforcement Learning from Meta-Evaluation (RLME), which optimizes a generator using reward derived from an evaluator's answers to natural-language meta-questions (e.g., "Is the answer correct?" or "Is the reasoning logically consistent?"). RLME treats the evaluator's probability of a positive judgment as a reward and updates the generator via group-relative policy optimization, enabling learning without labels. Across a suite of experiments, we show that RLME achieves accuracy and sample efficiency comparable to label-based training, enables controllable trade-offs among multiple objectives, steers models toward reliable reasoning patterns rather than post-hoc rationalization, and generalizes to open-domain settings where ground-truth labels are unavailable, broadening the domains in which LLMs may be trained with RL.
