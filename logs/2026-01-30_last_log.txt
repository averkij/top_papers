Previous work (Chen et al., 2025) attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-anderror, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight "scouts" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.

Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across wide range of tasks (Guo et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025d; Zhang et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b; Yao et al., preprint; Shridhar et al., 2020), primarily driven by extensive pretraining on high quality text cor1Nanyang Technological University 2Sense Time 3Sun Correspondence to: Dacheng Tao Yat-sen University. <dacheng.tao@ntu.edu.sg>. Figure 1. Exploration and Distillation Stage will either directly award the language models the skills, such as the performance on Sokoban-Box2 (below) that leads to direct convergence (0.0 to 0.45), or indirectly teach relevant knowledge that will be later activated via Evolving Stage, such as the performance on Sudoku (above figure, from 0.0, to 0.29, then to 0.97). pora (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2023). This equips LLMs with broad world knowledge, enabling strong zero-shot generalization in language correlated scenarios such as creative writing, summarization, reasoning, and even language based agentic tasks (Li et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023; Shao et al., 2024; Shridhar et al., 2020; Yao et al., preprint). However, when deployed in unseen, non-linguistic tasks such as spatial tasks (Ghugare et al., 2025; Gu et al., 2023), symbolic 1 Language-based Trial and Error Falls Behind in the Era of Experience Figure 2. Overview of the SCOUT framework. The pipeline consists of three stages: (1) Exploration Stage: Lightweight scouts efficiently capture environmental dynamics to generate expert trajectories; (2) Distillation Stage: These trajectories are textualized to "warm-up" the LLM via supervised fine-tuning; (3) Evolving Stage: The LLM further refines its reasoning and decision making capabilities through multi-turn PPO. tasks (Brockman et al., 2016) and complex long horizon tasks (Luo et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025c), existing pretraining is far from sufficient. These tasks demonstrate that the real world is unbounded, involving "endless complexity" (Sutton, 2019). Therefore it is hard to fully simplify and cover all tasks during pretraining. LLMs rich pretrained knowledge struggles in these scenarios because now they need to internalize the environmental dynamics from scratch rather than directly utilizing the pretrained world knowledge. SPA (Chen et al., 2025) attributes this performance gap to the fact that LLMs are significantly less familiar with symbolic state-based tasks (Brockman et al., 2016) compared to the language based state tasks like Webshop (Yao et al., preprint),ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020). SPA separates the in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks by the state perplexity against random guess. In this work, we focus on these out-of-distribution tasks that are often composed of various symbols or numbers, rather than natural language, and are more alien to language agents. The newly introduced tasks in this work are also OOD tasks, and we show the higher state perplexity against random guess as evidence of OOD tasks as SPA (Chen et al., 2025) does in Table 5. We mainly focus on these symbolic and spatial tasks, and call them "unseen tasks" in this work. Beyond the pretraining stage, the inefficiency of LLM agents in mastering these new tasks also stems from two fundamental mismatches. First, there is mismatch between the action space and the generation space. Generating token requires forward pass through billions of parameters of LLMs, resulting in low efficiency for both exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, an LLM is exploring vast vocabulary space (typically exceeding 30,000 tokens), whereas many reasoning and symbolic tasks (Brockman et al., 2016) require only discrete, low dimensional set of actions. Although settings like temperature and top-k can reduce the candidate tokens, forcing an LLM to search for optimal policies within such high-dimensional semantic space is computationally wasteful and hinders efficient exploration. Second, depending solely on language priors limits scalability. The "Bitter Lesson" (Sutton, 2019) teaches us that leveraging computation (searching and learning) is far more effective than relying on predefined knowledge in the long run. Although LLMs are semantically rich, they struggle to grasp the specific dynamics of the physical world (Ghugare et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024; Yamada et al., 2023) that cannot be fully encoded in text. To bridge this gap, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), novel agent framework that harmonizes the exploitation on world knowledge of LLM agents with the exploration efficiency of "scouts". As shown in Figure 2, our key insight is to decouple the heavy exploration phase of LLM agents from the exploitation phase. Specifically, we employ lightweight neural networks (e.g., small MLPs or CNNs) to serve as "scouts". Their low parameter count and high inference speed "

However, open-source multimodal models still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with detailed, visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.

[ 1 9 6 0 2 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r aLong-context reasoning has significantly empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks, yet it introduces severe efficiency bottlenecks due to the computational complexity. Existing efficient approaches often rely on complex additional training or external models for compression, which limits scalability and discards critical fine-grained information. In this paper, we propose VTC-R1, new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process. Instead of processing lengthy textual traces, VTC-R1 renders intermediate reasoning segments into compact images, which are iteratively fed back into visionlanguage models as optical memory. We construct training dataset based on OpenR1-Math220K achieving 3.4 token compression and finetune representative VLMsGlyph and Qwen3VL. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME25, AMC23 and GPQA-D demonstrate that VTC-R1 consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7 speedup in end-toend latency, highlighting its potential as scalable solution for reasoning-intensive applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/ w-yibo/VTC-R1. 1. Introduction Reasoning capability (Li et al., 2025b; Lightman et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023; Huang & Chang, 2023; Yao et al., 2025) has emerged as powerful technique of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to tackle complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2025a; Hu et al., 2025) and code generation (Chen et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2024). Recent advancements, exemplified by OpenAI o1 (OpenAI, 2024) and DeepSeek1Nanyang Technical University 2Alibaba Cloud Computing. Preprint. Figure 1. Comparison between existing efficient reasoning approaches and vision-text compression (VTC). Existing methods either require additional training or sampling procedures, or rely on external strong models. In contrast, VTC leverages lightweight rendering to transform long textual reasoning traces into compact visual representations, enabling VLMs to encode information with significantly fewer vision tokens (3-4 compression). This approach is both lightweight and model-free. R1 (Guo et al., 2025), leverage reinforcement learning to further scale this capability to long-context reasoning, substantially improving performance on challenging real-world tasks (Wang et al., 2026b). Despite recent progress, longcontext reasoning introduces severe efficiency bottlenecks. The computational complexity of the transformer architecture (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Kitaev et al., 2020) grows quadratically with sequence length, causing both computation and memory costs to increase rapidly as the context expands. This leads to degraded inference speed, reduced training efficiency, and limited scalability, which significantly hinders real-world deployment. To mitigate these issues, several efficient approaches are proposed (Chen et al., 2025; Munkhbat et al., 2025; Lee et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024). Existing methods can be broadly categorized into two groups. i) Extra training or sampling stages beyond standard training. For example, CoT-Valve (Ma et al., 2025b) adopts multi-stage training procedure to obtain models specialized for different reasoning lengths and O1-Pruner (Luo et al., 2025b) applies offline VTC-R1 : Vision-Text Compression for Efficient Long-Context Reasoning reinforcement learning with multiple sampled trajectories (16 responses per problem). These approaches increase training and inference cost. ii) External strong models to guide reasoning compression. TokenSkip (Xia et al., 2025) requires an additional model to estimate token importance, while R1-Compress (Wang et al., 2025) and InftyThink (Yan et al., 2025) depend on powerful external summarization models (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) to condense long reasoning traces. Although both categories of methods are effective, they often restrict exploration space and discard fine-grained information that is critical for reasoning. Without additional training or external models, how can we achieve efficient reasoning while preserving fine-grained information? Motivated by this, promising yet underexplored direction is vision-text compression (VTC) (Wei et al., 2025; Cheng et al., 2025; Xing et al., 2025b; Zhao et al., 2025; Xing et al., 2025a). Rather than reducing fine-grained information, VTC adopts an alternative representation by transforming textual content into visual forms via lightweight rendering, enabling vision-language models (VLMs) to encode rich semantic information using substantially fewer vision tokens. This design is lightweight and model-free, as shown in Figure 1, introducing no additional training stages or reliance on external compression models. Prior works such as DeepSeek-OCR (Wei et al., 2025) and Glyph (Cheng et al., 2025) focus on text reconstruction or long-context understanding, showing that long text sequences can be represented with 310 token compression while maintaining high decoding precision. However, whether such high-density visual representations can preserve and support multi-step reasoning processes remains unclear. Notably, mathematical reasoning, with its symbolic structure and step-wise derivations, is naturally amenable to visual rendering, making it suitable and principled testbed for studying reasoning-oriented vision-text compression. To bridge this gap, we propose VTC-R1, new efficient reasoning paradigm that iteratively integrates visiontext compression into long-context reasoning. VTC-R1 treats the reasoning process as multiple processes, where the preceding process are regarded as long-context and rendered into compact images, and performs iterative reasoning (Yan et al., 2025) with VLMs. As illustrated in Figure 2, the reasoning process is decomposed into sequence of reasoning steps. Upon the completion of each step, it is rendered into an image. To proceed to the next step, the accumulated images of previous steps are fed back into the model alongside the question, functioning as form of optical memory that compactly encodes previous reasoning using vision tokens.

Text:"Beyond Imitation: Reinforcement Learning for Active Latent Planning Zhi Zheng 1 Wee Sun Lee 1 6 2 0 2 9 2 ] A . [ 1 8 9 5 1 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r aAiming at efficient and dense chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, latent reasoning methods finetune Large Language Models (LLMs) to substitute discrete language tokens with continuous latent tokens. These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the Active Latent Planning method (ATPLatent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) to obtain smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1% accuracy and -3.3% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines.

Equivalent Language CoTs may lead to different latent reasoning policies. Existing latent reasoning methods (b) imitate one of them, leading to suboptimal policies. The proposed ATPLatent method (c) actively optimizes the latent reasoning policies in well-defined space, employing both the verifiable accuracy of answers and the coherence of decoded latent CoTs as rewards. 1. Introduction Large Language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in mathematical reasoning (Li et al., 2025b), especially equipped with the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques (Wei et al., 2022). In pursuit of superior reasoning ability, LLMs can be further refined with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) (Hu et al., 2022; Xia et al., 2025) or reinforcement learning (RL) techniques (Shao et al., 2024). However, although significant improvements in reasoning ability are achieved, these techniques usually lead to significantly longer CoT reasoning paths (Liu et al., 2025b; Feng Beyond Imitation: Reinforcement Learning for Active Latent Planning et al., 2025), which will hinder the application of LLMs to scenarios that require real-time responses. To reduce the latency of LLM-based reasoning, recent work has explored implicit latent reasoning, which aims to enable LLMs to represent and reason in continuous latent space (Hao et al., 2024; Tan et al., 2025; Shen et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2025; Deng et al., 2025). As shown in Figure 1(b), latent reasoning methods feed high-dimensional embeddings (named latent tokens)rather than sampled discrete language tokensinto the model at the next LLM step. These methods can avoid redundant natural-language tokens (e.g., those used mainly for semantic cohesion or interpretability-oriented summarization), thus increasing the information density per token and improving the reasoning performance under fixed token budget. In implementing the language-to-latent token shift, existing methods generally adopt an imitation-based strategy, mapping the thinking policy of each part of the language CoTs to latent token through token-by-token curriculum learning (Hao et al., 2024), self-distillation (Shen et al., 2025), or compression (Tan et al., 2025). These methods can achieve clear reductions in token cost. However, as shown in Figure 1 (a), there are usually several equivalent correct language CoT for each question, so learning the latent reasoning policy by imitating an arbitrary one of them will lead to overfitted latent token representations and biased latent policies, resulting in clear performance gaps between training and testing. To achieve more generalizable latent reasoning, this paper highlights the importance of active planning over latent tokens in pursuing the optimal latent reasoning policy. To this end, as shown in Figure 1(c), we propose the two-stage Active Latent Planning (ATP-Latent) method. In the SFTstage, ATP-Latent extends the original imitation-based methods to train variational auto-encoder (Kingma & Welling, 2013) (VAE) for interpretability and smooth latent token representation space. Unlike prior latent reasoning methods that only passively imitate single labeled CoT trajectory, ATP-Latent actively optimizes latent reasoning policies in the RL stage, employing both the final answers correctness (i.e., Accuracy in Figure 1(c)) and the consistency of VAE-decoded contents (i.e., Coherence in Figure 1(c)) as rewards, providing soft constraints for the RL state space. We conduct experiments over LLaMA-1B LLMs, demonstrating that ATP-Latent achieves superior reasoning efficiency and accuracy with fewer latent tokens compared with prior SFT and imitation-only latent reasoning methods. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: ATP-Latent highlights the significance of active reasoning path planning in finding good latent reasoning policy, introducing VAE and stop-head for smoother latent token representation space. In the RL process, the proposed ATP-Latent method utilizes the supervised VAE decoder to decode latent tokens and employs the consistency between the VAE-decoded contents as auxiliary rewards, yielding unsupervised but beneficial RL training signals for latent planning, providing soft constraints for the RL state space. ATP-Latent with LLaMA-1B demonstrates 4.1% more accuracy and 3.3% fewer tokens on numerical reasoning benchmarks compared to advanced baselines. 2. Preliminaries 2.1.

[ 1 6 0 4 1 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r aUnified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate both visual understanding and generation within single framework. Their ultimate aspiration is to create cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified MultiRepresentation Generation), simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities. 1. Introduction What cannot create, do not understand. Richard Feynman Work done during internship at AMAP, Alibaba Group *Equal contribution Project lead 1Tsinghua University 2AMAP, Alibaba Group 3Shanghai Jiao Tong University 4Southern University of Science and Technology. Preprint. January 30, 2026. 1 Figure 1. Examples of depth and segmentation generation. Offthe-shelf UMMs (e.g., Harmon-1.5B (Wu et al., 2025c)) struggle to generate plausible depth/segmentation maps from input images, often producing outputs closer to RGB reconstruction. UniMRG post-trains UMMs to generate these intrinsic representations, encouraging them to internalize geometric cues (depth) and structural cues (segmentation) that are beneficial for visual understanding. Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) (Wu et al., 2025c; Xie et al., 2025b; Pan et al., 2025; Deng et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025a; Wei et al., 2025) unify visual understanding and generation capabilities in single architecture, representing significant advancement in multimodal AI. These models can simultaneously handle image understanding tasks (e.g., visual question answering, image captioning) and generation tasks (e.g., text-to-image generation, image editing), providing greater flexibility and efficiency compared to traditional single-task models. key aspiration of such unified frameworks is that understanding and generation capabilities can mutually reinforce each other, leading to more powerful multimodal intelligence. Recently, several works have begun to explore the posttraining of UMMs. For instance, RecA (Xie et al., 2025a) utilizes rich semantic information from UMMs own understanding encoder for reconstruction, significantly improving visual generation capability. SRUM (Jin et al., 2025) employs the understanding capability of UMMs to score generated images, enabling self-rewarding training. These works suggest that UMMs understanding capability can Generation Enhances Understanding in Unified Multimodal Models via Multi-Representation Generation be leveraged to improve generation capability. However, the reverse direction of leveraging generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. This leads to natural question: can UMMs generation capabilities also enhance their understanding capabilities? To investigate this question, we study simple yet revealing setup: prompting UMMs to generate intrinsic visual representations of an input image beyond RGB appearance. We choose representations that (i) capture intrinsic factors that are weakly constrained by pixel reconstruction, (ii) provide dense supervision aligned with common failure modes of visual understanding (e.g., spatial reasoning errors and hallucinations). Based on these criteria, we choose depth and segmentation, leaving other representations for future work. Depth explicitly encodes geometry and relative distance, while segmentation delineates object boundaries and region partitions, offering an object-centric structural prior. However, as shown in Figure 1, off-the-shelf UMMs often fail to generate such representations, producing outputs that resemble RGB reconstruction rather than plausible depth/segmentation. This suggests that these intrinsic geometric and structural cues are not well captured in UMMs internal representations. We therefore post-train UMMs to generate depth and segmentation maps, which explicitly encode geometry and structure, respectively. This auxiliary generation encourages UMMs to internalize these regularities, which in turn transfers to stronger understanding. Figure 2 provides concrete example of this idea. Focusing on depth as representative intrinsic signal, offthe-shelf UMMs fail to generate plausible depth maps and also struggle with spatial understanding, whereas imageto-depth post-training enables UMMs to produce coherent depth maps and yields noticeably stronger spatial understanding. Building on this insight, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method that improves understanding via auxiliary generation of intrinsic representations. Specifically, UniMRG trains UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic image representations, including pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), along with standard visual understanding objectives. By learning to synthesize these complementary representations, UMMs can better capture appearance cues, spatial relations, and structural layout, leading to stronger and more comprehensive visual understanding. We validate our approach across various UMM architectures, including autoregressive, masked autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs. Experimental results consistently show that our method notably improves fine-grained perception, mitigates hallucinations, and strengthens spatial understanding, while also enhancing"

Unlike traditional benchmarks that target singleanswer retrieval or broad-spectrum factuality, DeepSearchQA features dataset of challenging, handcrafted tasks designed to evaluate an agents ability to execute complex search plans to generate exhaustive answer lists.

DynamicVLA addresses dynamic object manipulation challenges through a compact vision-language-action model with temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation, supported by a new benchmark for dynamic manipulation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Manipulating dynamic objects remains an open challenge for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which, despite strong generalization in static manipulation, struggle in dynamic scenarios requiring rapid perception, temporal anticipation, and continuous control. We present DynamicVLA, a framework for dynamic object manipulation that integrates temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation through three key designs: 1) a compact 0.4B VLA using a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding, enabling fast multimodal inference; 2) Continuous Inference, enabling overlapping reasoning and execution for lower latency and timely adaptation to object motion; and 3) Latent-aware Action Streaming, which bridges the perception-execution gap by enforcing temporally aligned action execution. To fill the missing foundation of dynamic manipulation data, we introduce the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark, built from scratch with an auto data collection pipeline that efficiently gathers 200K synthetic episodes across 2.8K scenes and 206 objects, and enables fast collection of 2K real-world episodes without teleoperation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate remarkable improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, positioning DynamicVLA as a unified framework for general dynamic object manipulation across embodiments.

A novel framework called SCOUT is introduced that uses lightweight scouts to reduce exploration costs for large language models in nonlinguistic environments, enabling improved performance through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight "scouts" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.

A large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset called MMFineReason is introduced to improve vision language models' performance through high-quality reasoning annotations and demonstrates superior parameter efficiency in fine-tuned models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a "less is more" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7\% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.

"A large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset called MMFineReason is introduced to improve vision language models' performance through high-quality reasoning annotations and demonstrates superior parameter efficiency in fine-tuned models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a "less is more" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7\% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities."

VTC-R1 enables efficient long-context reasoning by compressing textual traces into compact images and iteratively feeding them back into vision-language models as optical memory, achieving significant speedup without sacrificing performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-context reasoning has significantly empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks, yet it introduces severe efficiency bottlenecks due to the computational complexity. Existing efficient approaches often rely on complex additional training or external models for compression, which limits scalability and discards critical fine-grained information. In this paper, we propose VTC-R1, a new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process. Instead of processing lengthy textual traces, VTC-R1 renders intermediate reasoning segments into compact images, which are iteratively fed back into vision-language models as "optical memory." We construct a training dataset based on OpenR1-Math-220K achieving 3.4x token compression and fine-tune representative VLMs-Glyph and Qwen3-VL. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME25, AMC23 and GPQA-D demonstrate that VTC-R1 consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7x speedup in end-to-end latency, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for reasoning-intensive applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/w-yibo/VTC-R1.

A minimal post-training approach using supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and small-scale reinforcement fine-tuning enables the development of high-quality sovereign language models with reduced resource requirements.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have progressed rapidly; however, most state-of-the-art models are trained and evaluated primarily in high-resource languages such as English and Chinese, and are often developed by a small number of organizations with access to large-scale compute and data. This gatekeeping creates a practical barrier for sovereign settings in which a regional- or national-scale institution or domain owner must retain control and understanding of model weights, training data, and deployment while operating under limited resources and strict transparency constraints. To this end, we identify two core requirements: (1) adoptability, the ability to transform a base model into a general-purpose assistant, and (2) sovereign capability, the ability to perform high-stakes, region-specific tasks (e.g., legal reasoning in local languages and cultural knowledge). We investigate whether these requirements can be achieved without scaling massive instruction corpora or relying on complex preference tuning pipelines and large-scale reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We present Typhoon S, a minimal and open post-training recipe that combines supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and small-scale RFT. Using Thai as a representative case study, we demonstrate that our approach transforms both sovereign-adapted and general-purpose base models into instruction-tuned models with strong general performance. We further show that small-scale RFT with InK-GRPO -- an extension of GRPO that augments the GRPO loss with a next-word prediction loss -- improves Thai legal reasoning and Thai-specific knowledge while preserving general capabilities. Our results suggest that a carefully designed post-training strategy can reduce the required scale of instruction data and computation, providing a practical path toward high-quality sovereign LLMs under academic-scale resources.

Multimodal Large Language Models suffer from cross-modal hallucinations where one modality incorrectly influences generation from another, leading to fabricated outputs; this exposes a fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, a training-free method called Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD) is proposed that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements by leveraging the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance. MAD uses extracted modality probabilities to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models, showing that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output.

Agent-RRM, a multi-faceted reward model, provides structured feedback for agentic trajectories through reasoning traces, critiques, and performance scores, with unified feedback integration showing superior performance across diverse benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has achieved notable success in enabling agents to perform complex reasoning and tool use. However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. In this paper, we introduce Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM), a multi-faceted reward model that produces structured feedback for agentic trajectories, including (1) an explicit reasoning trace , (2) a focused critique that provides refinement guidance by highlighting reasoning flaws, and (3) an overall score that evaluates process performance. Leveraging these signals, we systematically investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration). Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of our reasoning reward model and training schemes.

Active latent planning method improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency by modeling latent token supervision as conditional VAE and using reinforcement learning with coherence rewards.  					AI-generated summary 				 Aiming at efficient and dense chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, latent reasoning methods fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to substitute discrete language tokens with continuous latent tokens. These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the Active Latent Planning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\% accuracy and -3.3\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines. Codes are available on https://github.com/zz1358m/ATP-Latent-master.

"Active latent planning method improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency by modeling latent token supervision as conditional VAE and using reinforcement learning with coherence rewards.  					AI-generated summary 				 Aiming at efficient and dense chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, latent reasoning methods fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to substitute discrete language tokens with continuous latent tokens. These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the Active Latent Planning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\% accuracy and -3.3\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines. Codes are available on https://github.com/zz1358m/ATP-Latent-master."

UniMRG enhances unified multimodal models by training them to generate multiple visual representations, improving both understanding and generation capabilities through complementary information capture.  					AI-generated summary 				 Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate both visual understanding and generation within a single framework. Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities.

A two-stage trained cybersecurity reasoning model achieves competitive performance on specialized tasks while maintaining general capabilities through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, the first open-source native reasoning model for cybersecurity. Built upon our previously released Foundation-Sec-8B base model (derived from Llama-3.1-8B-Base), the model is trained through a two-stage process combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our training leverages proprietary reasoning data spanning cybersecurity analysis, instruction-following, and mathematical reasoning. Evaluation across 10 cybersecurity benchmarks and 10 general-purpose benchmarks demonstrates performance competitive with significantly larger models on cybersecurity tasks while maintaining strong general capabilities. The model shows effective generalization on multi-hop reasoning tasks and strong safety performance when deployed with appropriate system prompts and guardrails. This work demonstrates that domain-specialized reasoning models can achieve strong performance on specialized tasks while maintaining broad general capabilities.

DeepSearchQA presents a 900-prompt benchmark evaluating agents on complex multi-step information-seeking tasks requiring systematic information collation, deduplication, and reasoning about stopping criteria across 17 fields.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce DeepSearchQA, a 900-prompt benchmark for evaluating agents on difficult multi-step information-seeking tasks across 17 different fields. Unlike traditional benchmarks that target single answer retrieval or broad-spectrum factuality, DeepSearchQA features a dataset of challenging, handcrafted tasks designed to evaluate an agent's ability to execute complex search plans to generate exhaustive answer lists. This shift in design explicitly tests three critical, yet under-evaluated capabilities: 1) systematic collation of fragmented information from disparate sources, 2) de-duplication and entity resolution to ensure precision, and 3) the ability to reason about stopping criteria within an open-ended search space. Each task is structured as a causal chain, where discovering information for one step is dependent on the successful completion of the previous one, stressing long-horizon planning and context retention. All tasks are grounded in the open web with objectively verifiable answer sets. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art agent architectures reveals significant performance limitations: even the most advanced models struggle to balance high recall with precision. We observe distinct failure modes ranging from premature stopping (under-retrieval) to hedging behaviors, where agents cast an overly wide net of low-confidence answers to artificially boost recall. These findings highlight critical headroom in current agent designs and position DeepSearchQA as an essential diagnostic tool for driving future research toward more robust, deep-research capabilities.

AI-generated summary 				 We introduce DeepSearchQA, a 900-prompt benchmark for evaluating agents on difficult multi-step information-seeking tasks across 17 different fields. Unlike traditional benchmarks that target single answer retrieval or broad-spectrum factuality, DeepSearchQA features a dataset of challenging, handcrafted tasks designed to evaluate an agent's ability to execute complex search plans to generate exhaustive answer lists. This shift in design explicitly tests three critical, yet under-evaluated capabilities: 1) systematic collation of fragmented information from disparate sources, 2) de-duplication and entity resolution to ensure precision, and 3) the ability to reason about stopping criteria within an open-ended search space. Each task is structured as a causal chain, where discovering information for one step is dependent on the successful completion of the previous one, stressing long-horizon planning and context retention. All tasks are grounded in the open web with objectively verifiable answer sets. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art agent architectures reveals significant performance limitations: even the most advanced models struggle to balance high recall with precision. We observe distinct failure modes ranging from premature stopping (under-retrieval) to hedging behaviors, where agents cast an overly wide net of low-confidence answers to artificially boost recall. These findings highlight critical headroom in current agent designs and position DeepSearchQA as an essential diagnostic tool for driving future research toward more robust, deep-research capabilities."

WebArbiter introduces a reasoning-first WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation to improve web navigation through structured justifications and preference verdicts, outperforming existing baselines in complex web environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 Web agents hold great potential for automating complex computer tasks, yet their interactions involve long-horizon, sequential decision-making with irreversible actions. In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points. In reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite, it surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points, underscoring its robustness and practical value in real-world complex web tasks.

WorldBench is introduced as a video-based benchmark for disentangled evaluation of physical reasoning in generative models, revealing specific failure patterns in current state-of-the-art video world models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in generative foundational models, often termed "world models," have propelled interest in applying them to critical tasks like robotic planning and autonomous system training. For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.
