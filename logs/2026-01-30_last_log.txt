Text:"Scalable Power Sampling: Unlocking Efficient, Training-Free Reasoning for LLMs via Distribution Sharpening Xiaotong Ji * 1 Rasul Tutunov * 1 Matthieu Zimmer 1 Haitham Bou AmmarReinforcement learning (RL) post-training is dominant approach for improving the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet growing evidence suggests that its gains arise primarily from distribution sharpening rather than the acquisition of new capabilities. Recent work has shown that sampling from the power distribution of LLMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can recover performance comparable to RL post-training without relying on external rewards; however, the high computational cost of MCMC makes such approaches impractical for widespread adoption. In this work, we propose theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC. We derive novel formulation showing that the global power distribution can be approximated by token-level scaled low-temperature one, where the scaling factor captures future trajectory quality. Leveraging this insight, we introduce training-free and verifier-free algorithm that sharpens the base models generative distribution autoregressively. Empirically, we evaluate our method on math, QA, and code tasks across four LLMs, and show that our method matches or surpasses one-shot GRPO without relying on any external rewards, while reducing inference latency by over 10 compared to MCMC-based sampling. 6 2 0 2 9 ] . [ 1 0 9 5 1 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r 1. Introduction The current frontier of large language models (LLMs) reasoning is largely defined by reinforcement learning (RL) post-training. By optimising models against automated verifiers, such as unit tests in coding tasks (Chen et al., 2021; *Equal contribution 1Huawei Noahs Ark Lab 2UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence. Correspondence to: Haitham Bou Ammar <haitham.ammar@huawei.com>. Preprint. January 30, 2026. 1 Roziere et al., 2023; Hou et al., 2024), final-answer checks or Lean certificates in mathematics (Cobbe et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2023; Ahn et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024; Zimmer et al., 2025), methods like Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) and its variants have established state-of-theart performance across range of benchmarks (Zhao et al., 2023; Shao et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2025). However, the mechanisms underlying these gains remain the subject of active debate. growing body of evidence suggests that RL may not introduce fundamentally new reasoning capabilities, but instead acts as form of distribution sharpening (He et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025; Yue et al., 2025; Gai et al., 2025; Ni et al., 2025). Under this view, the reasoning trajectories required to solve complex problems already exist within the base model; RL primarily reshapes the probability mass. If post-trained models are indeed sharpened versions of the base model, it follows that comparable reasoning capabilities should be attainable by directly targeting sharpened distribution of the base LLM without relying on external validation rewards. Recent work by Karan & Du (2025) provides compelling evidence for this view. They make use of the power distribution, pα(x), as principled mechanism for inducing such sharpening without any additional training. Strikingly, their results show that sampling from the power distribution enables base models to match and, in some cases, surpass the performance of RL-trained models on challenging benchmarks, such as MATH500 and GPQA. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that the reasoning capabilities attributed to RL are largely latent within the base model and can be revealed through an appropriate sampling strategy. Although the power distribution offers compelling mechanism for sharpening base model capabilities, current methods for sampling from it are computationally prohibitive. Karan & Du (2025) argue that standard autoregressive sampling methods like those in low-temperature sampling (Wang et al., 2020) fail to capture the global properties of pα. Consequently, they resort to MCMC techniques, specifically Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that iteratively resamples token subsequence. While effective, this approach introduces significant latency, requiring multiple forward passes and iterative refinement steps to generate single response. Approximate Power Distribution Sampling for LLM Reasoning Such computational overhead restricts the methods scalability for real-world deployment. To enable broad adoption, we seek faster and more scalable sampling procedure while retaining the performance advantages of MCMC. To this end, we revisit the fundamental relationship between the power distribution and the low-temperature distribution. While prior work has established that these distributions are theoretically distinct, we derive novel formulation showing that the power distribution can be effectively approximated by suitably scaled low-temperature policy. We explicitly identify the required scaling factor and theoretically quantify the accuracy of this approximation. This insight allows us to bypass the iterative cost of MCMC entirely: by proposing (training-free and verifier-free) algorithm that applies this scaling during standard autoregressive generation, we efficiently target the sharpened distribution, retaining the reasoning benefits of the power distribution while reducing inference latency by over 10. In short, our contributions can be summarised as: (1) We bridge the theoretical gap between global power distributions and local autoregressive sampling. We prove that the power distribution can be decomposed into scaled low-temperature one, deriving closedform scaling factor and providing rigorous bounds on the approximation error. (2) We introduce trainingand verifier-free algorithm that enables direct autoregressive generation from the sharpened distribution. This eliminates the iterative overhead of MCMC, reducing inference latency by over 10 while preserving the reasoning improvements of the global power distribution. (3) Across four LLMs and three benchmarks (MATH500, HumanEval, GPQA), we show that our method matches or surpasses one-shot GRPO performance on in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, without any parameter updates or external rewards. 2. Power & Low-Temperature Distributions In prior work, Karan & Du (2025) show that the power distribution is fundamentally distinct from standard lowtemperature sampling.

We introduce Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA), scalable framework that employs Influence Functions to trace interpretable units back to specific training samples. Through extensive experiments on the Pythia family, we causally validate that targeted interventionremoving or augmenting small fraction of high-influence samplessignificantly modulates the emergence of interpretable heads, whereas random interventions show no effect. Our analysis reveals that repetitive structural data (e.g., LaTeX, XML) acts as mechanistic catalyst. Furthermore, we observe that interventions targeting induction head formation induce concurrent change in the models in-context learning (ICL) capability. This provides direct causal evidence for the long-standing hypothesis regarding the functional link between induction heads and ICL. Finally, we propose mechanistic data augmentation pipeline that consistently accelerates circuit convergence across model scales, providing principled methodology for steering the developmental trajectories of LLMs. 6 2 0 2 9 2 ] .

Recent efforts have successfully identified specific interpretable units within Transformer-based LLMs, such as induction heads responsible for in-context copy1 Mechanistic Data Attribution: Tracing the Training Origins of Interpretable LLM Units ing and pattern completion (Olsson et al., 2022), knowledge neurons that store factual associations about specific entities (Dai et al., 2022), and monosemantic features disentangled via Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) (Huben et al., 2023; Bricken et al., 2023). These findings effectively describe what model computes during inference, offering detailed anatomy of the models internal mechanisms. Despite these successes, current MI research remains predominantly static. While we can reverse-engineer what circuit computes, we lack the tools to discern the causal origins of these computations within the training corpus. Bridging this gap holds significant value for both the scientific understanding of large language models and their practical governance. From scientific perspective, identifying the data-driven origins of internal components provides causal lens to observe how specialized circuitssuch as those for logical reasoning (Hong et al., 2025) or factual recall (Nichani et al., 2025)are shaped by the statistical properties of the training corpus (Chan et al., 2022). Simultaneously, from practical standpoint, these insights enable precise data-level interventions. By filtering deleterious samples or augmenting high-leverage data, researchers can predictably modulate the emergence of specific mechanisms, offering more fine-grained control over internal representations compared to traditional data attribution methods (Koh & Liang, 2017; Grosse et al., 2023; Kou et al., 2025). To address this challenge, we introduce Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA), novel methodological framework designed to trace the training origins of internal mechanisms, as shown in Figure 1. Unlike traditional Training Data Attribution (TDA) methods that typically focus on global model behavior (Koh & Liang, 2017; Grosse et al., 2023), MDA operates at the granularity of individual interpretable units, such as neurons, attention heads, or SAE features. By deriving specialized formulation of Influence Functions, our approach enables the precise computation of how specific training samples impact the functional properties of these units. This shift allows the analytical lens to move beyond descriptive analysis (this circuit exists) toward developmental tracing (this data distribution caused the formation of this circuit). To be specific, we make the following four contributions in this paper: Methodological Framework (Section 3): We propose the Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA) framework and derive scalable, gradient-based approach leveraging Influence Functions. This framework enables the precise identification of training samples that most significantly impact the functional behavior of interpretable LLM units. distinct attention head types (induction and previous-token heads (Olsson et al., 2022)), we demonstrate that removing small fraction ( 10%) of high-influence samples from the total training set significantly hinders the emergence of targeted heads (e.g., Induction Heads). Conversely, repeating these specific samples accelerates their formation, whereas randomly removing or augmenting an equivalent volume of data yields no such effect. Mechanistic Insights (Section 5): Our investigation into the formation of induction heads reveals several key findings: 1) Data Composition: Noisy data characterized by highly repetitive patterns, predominantly sourced from LaTeX and XML, significantly accelerates the emergence of induction heads. 2) Transferability: High-influence samples generalize effectively across different induction heads, exhibiting significant overlap in their identified influential subsets. 3) Emergence Dynamics: Induction head formation is not driven by sparse sample subsets but develops steadily as training tokens accumulate, with high-influence samples primarily modu"

A theoretically grounded method for improving large language model reasoning performance through distribution sharpening without iterative sampling or external rewards, achieving comparable results to reinforcement learning post-training with significantly reduced computational costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is a dominant approach for improving the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet growing evidence suggests that its gains arise primarily from distribution sharpening rather than the acquisition of new capabilities. Recent work has shown that sampling from the power distribution of LLMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can recover performance comparable to RL post-training without relying on external rewards; however, the high computational cost of MCMC makes such approaches impractical for widespread adoption. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC. We derive a novel formulation showing that the global power distribution can be approximated by a token-level scaled low-temperature one, where the scaling factor captures future trajectory quality. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a training-free and verifier-free algorithm that sharpens the base model's generative distribution autoregressively. Empirically, we evaluate our method on math, QA, and code tasks across four LLMs, and show that our method matches or surpasses one-shot GRPO without relying on any external rewards, while reducing inference latency by over 10x compared to MCMC-based sampling.

Mechnistic Data Attribution framework traces interpretable units to specific training samples using influence functions, demonstrating causal relationships between data structure and neural circuit formation in language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 While Mechanistic Interpretability has identified interpretable circuits in LLMs, their causal origins in training data remain elusive. We introduce Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA), a scalable framework that employs Influence Functions to trace interpretable units back to specific training samples. Through extensive experiments on the Pythia family, we causally validate that targeted intervention--removing or augmenting a small fraction of high-influence samples--significantly modulates the emergence of interpretable heads, whereas random interventions show no effect. Our analysis reveals that repetitive structural data (e.g., LaTeX, XML) acts as a mechanistic catalyst. Furthermore, we observe that interventions targeting induction head formation induce a concurrent change in the model's in-context learning (ICL) capability. This provides direct causal evidence for the long-standing hypothesis regarding the functional link between induction heads and ICL. Finally, we propose a mechanistic data augmentation pipeline that consistently accelerates circuit convergence across model scales, providing a principled methodology for steering the developmental trajectories of LLMs.

Hidden superior models exist in public repositories but are overlooked due to inefficient discovery methods; a multi-armed bandit approach using shared query sets and aggressive elimination significantly accelerates identification of top-performing models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Public repositories host millions of fine-tuned models, yet community usage remains disproportionately concentrated on a small number of foundation checkpoints. We investigate whether this concentration reflects efficient market selection or if superior models are systematically overlooked. Through an extensive evaluation of over 2,000 models, we show the prevalence of "hidden gems", unpopular fine-tunes that significantly outperform their popular counterparts. Notably, within the Llama-3.1-8B family, we find rarely downloaded checkpoints that improve math performance from 83.2% to 96.0% without increasing inference costs. However, discovering these models through exhaustive evaluation of every uploaded model is computationally infeasible. We therefore formulate model discovery as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem and accelerate the Sequential Halving search algorithm by using shared query sets and aggressive elimination schedules. Our method retrieves top models with as few as 50 queries per candidate, accelerating discovery by over 50x.

Авторы исследовали более 2000 моделей и обнаружили «скрытые жемчужины» — редко загружаемые файнтюны, значительно превосходящие популярные аналоги. Задача поиска оптимальных моделей была сформулирована как задача многорукого бандита, а алгоритм Sequential Halving был ускорен благодаря использованию общих наборов запросов и агрессивной элиминации. Предложенный метод позволяет найти лучшие модели с помощью всего 50 запросов на кандидата, ускорив поиск более чем в 50 раз.",

"Hidden superior models exist in public repositories but are overlooked due to inefficient discovery methods; a multi-armed bandit approach using shared query sets and aggressive elimination significantly accelerates identification of top-performing models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Public repositories host millions of fine-tuned models, yet community usage remains disproportionately concentrated on a small number of foundation checkpoints. We investigate whether this concentration reflects efficient market selection or if superior models are systematically overlooked. Through an extensive evaluation of over 2,000 models, we show the prevalence of "hidden gems", unpopular fine-tunes that significantly outperform their popular counterparts. Notably, within the Llama-3.1-8B family, we find rarely downloaded checkpoints that improve math performance from 83.2% to 96.0% without increasing inference costs. However, discovering these models through exhaustive evaluation of every uploaded model is computationally infeasible. We therefore formulate model discovery as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem and accelerate the Sequential Halving search algorithm by using shared query sets and aggressive elimination schedules. Our method retrieves top models with as few as 50 queries per candidate, accelerating discovery by over 50x."
