Text:"Healthy LLMs? Benchmarking LLM Knowledge of UK Government Public Health Information Joshua Harris Fan Grayson Felix Feldman Timothy Laurence Toby Nonnenmacher Oliver Higgins Leo Loman Selina Patel Thomas Finnie Samuel Collins Michael BorowitzAs Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely accessible, detailed understanding of their knowledge within specific domains becomes necessary for successful real world use. This is particularly critical in public health, where failure to retrieve relevant, accurate, and current information could significantly impact UK residents. However, currently little is known about LLM knowledge of UK Government public health information. To address this issue, this paper introduces new benchmark, PubHealthBench, with over 8000 questions for evaluating LLMs Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and free form responses to public health queries, created via an automated pipeline. We also release new dataset of the extracted UK Government public health guidance documents used as source text for PubHealthBench. Assessing 24 LLMs on PubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have high degree of knowledge, achieving >90% in the MCQA setup, and outperform humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form setup we see lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Therefore, whilst there are promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs are an increasingly accurate source of public health information, additional safeguards or tools may still be needed when providing free form responses on public health topics. 5 2 0 2 9 ] .

Under review.Public health guidance represents an important source of information for UK residents and experts to inform personal, professional, and clinical decision making. The release of highly capable Large Language Models (LLMs) [1], and particularly chatbots [2], could represent potentially significant shift in how public health guidance is retrieved, analysed, and disseminated. This in turn raises significant opportunities and risks for public health institutions both internally and when engaging the public. Whilst LLMs often undergo broad range of evaluations during development [36], relatively little is currently known about LLMs public health knowledge, including existing UK Government guidance. Furthermore, due to guidance undergoing regular revisions, and differing guidance being issued across institutions and geographies, accurate up to date knowledge of UK public health guidance may be particularly challenging for LLM systems. Therefore, as recently observed for BBC news stories [7], there is risk that LLM based applications and chatbots generate hallucinations [8] or incomplete information regarding UK public health advice. This in turn could potentially have significant impact on the public. These risks, combined with the increasing desire within the UK Government to incorporate LLMs into existing real world processes [9, 10], means comprehensive evaluations of LLMs understanding of UK public health guidance are needed. In this paper we introduce new dataset, Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) benchmark, and free form response benchmark for assessing LLMs knowledge across broad range of UK public health guidance1. Specifically our contributions include: UK public health guidance dataset2 - We collect, extract, markdown format, and chunk information from over 1000 publicly available UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) PDF and HTML documents from the UK Government website (gov.uk). We make the extracted text from filtered dataset (687 documents) publicly available in markdown format to enable further research into the use of LLMs on UK public health advice. PubHealthBench3 fully grounded MCQA benchmark - We implement an automated MCQA generation and validation pipeline grounded in the extracted guidance source text. This enables us to generate new benchmark with over 8000 MCQA questions to test LLM knowledge across broad range of current guidance. We provide results for both the full benchmark (PubHealthBench-Full) and manually reviewed subset (PubHealthBench-Reviewed). PubHealthBench-FreeForm - To assess LLMs in more realistic real-world setting we also implement free form response benchmark using the questions from the manually reviewed subset. By utilising the fact that every question can be linked back to the original source chunk and document, we implement grounded LLM judge to assess responses. Initial LLM evaluations - We evaluate 24 private and open-weight LLMs on this new public health benchmark. Given our focus on assessing knowledge, we primarily focus on SOTA non-reasoning models, but also include some leading reasoning models for comparison. Manual expert review and human baseline - To quality assure the benchmark and establish an upper bound for performance, human experts manually reviewed random sample of 800 MCQA examples (approx. 10% of the benchmark). Furthermore, in order to compare to human performance, 5 humans also took sample tests (total 600 MCQA examples) to establish human baseline with the use of search engines. This provides an initial indication of the boundary at which LLMs become similarly accurate to cursory search by non-expert humans.2.1 MCQA LLM evaluations Using Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) to assess the knowledge of LLMs is well established in the literature. Earlier work evaluating LLM knowledge in specific domains often used 1The guidance included can cover the entire UK or individual constituent countries, most documents primarily relate to English public health guidance.

We introduce Bielik v3, a series of parameter-efficient generative text models (1.5B and 4.5B) optimized for Polish language processing. These models demonstrate that smaller, well-optimized architectures can achieve performance comparable to much larger counterparts while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. Our approach incorporates several key innovations: a custom Polish tokenizer (APT4) that significantly improves token efficiency, Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss to balance learning across instruction types, and Adaptive Learning Rate that dynamically adjusts based on training progress. Trained on a meticulously curated corpus of 292 billion tokens spanning 303 million documents, these models excel across multiple benchmarks, including the Open PL LLM Leaderboard, Complex Polish Text Understanding Benchmark, Polish EQ-Bench, and Polish Medical Leaderboard. The 4.5B parameter model achieves results competitive with models 2-3 times its size, while the 1.5B model delivers strong performance despite its extremely compact profile. These advances establish new benchmarks for parameter-efficient language modeling in less-represented languages, making high-quality Polish language AI more accessible for resource-constrained applications.

We present Bielik 11B v2, a state-of-the-art language model optimized for Polish text processing. Built on the Mistral 7B v0.2 architecture and scaled to 11B parameters using depth up-scaling, this model demonstrates exceptional performance across Polish language benchmarks while maintaining strong cross-lingual capabilities. We introduce two key technical innovations: Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss, which optimizes learning across diverse instruction types by assigning quality-based weights to training examples, and Adaptive Learning Rate, which dynamically adjusts based on context length. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that Bielik 11B v2 outperforms many larger models, including those with 2-6 times more parameters, and significantly surpasses other specialized Polish language models on tasks ranging from linguistic understanding to complex reasoning. The model's parameter efficiency and extensive quantization options enable deployment across various hardware configurations, advancing Polish language AI capabilities and establishing new benchmarks for resource-efficient language modeling in less-represented languages.

"We present Bielik 11B v2, a state-of-the-art language model optimized for Polish text processing. Built on the Mistral 7B v0.2 architecture and scaled to 11B parameters using depth up-scaling, this model demonstrates exceptional performance across Polish language benchmarks while maintaining strong cross-lingual capabilities. We introduce two key technical innovations: Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss, which optimizes learning across diverse instruction types by assigning quality-based weights to training examples, and Adaptive Learning Rate, which dynamically adjusts based on context length. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that Bielik 11B v2 outperforms many larger models, including those with 2-6 times more parameters, and significantly surpasses other specialized Polish language models on tasks ranging from linguistic understanding to complex reasoning. The model's parameter efficiency and extensive quantization options enable deployment across various hardware configurations, advancing Polish language AI capabilities and establishing new benchmarks for resource-efficient language modeling in less-represented languages."

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely accessible, a detailed understanding of their knowledge within specific domains becomes necessary for successful real world use. This is particularly critical in public health, where failure to retrieve relevant, accurate, and current information could significantly impact UK residents. However, currently little is known about LLM knowledge of UK Government public health information. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new benchmark, PubHealthBench, with over 8000 questions for evaluating LLMs' Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and free form responses to public health queries, created via an automated pipeline. We also release a new dataset of the extracted UK Government public health guidance documents used as source text for PubHealthBench. Assessing 24 LLMs on PubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have a high degree of knowledge, achieving >90% in the MCQA setup, and outperform humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form setup we see lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Therefore, whilst there are promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs are an increasingly accurate source of public health information, additional safeguards or tools may still be needed when providing free form responses on public health topics.

We introduce Bielik v3, a series of parameter-efficient generative text models (1.5B and 4.5B) optimized for Polish language processing. These models demonstrate that smaller, well-optimized architectures can achieve performance comparable to much larger counterparts while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. Our approach incorporates several key innovations: a custom Polish tokenizer (APT4) that significantly improves token efficiency, Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss to balance learning across instruction types, and Adaptive Learning Rate that dynamically adjusts based on training progress. Trained on a meticulously curated corpus of 292 billion tokens spanning 303 million documents, these models excel across multiple benchmarks, including the Open PL LLM Leaderboard, Complex Polish Text Understanding Benchmark, Polish EQ-Bench, and Polish Medical Leaderboard. The 4.5B parameter model achieves results competitive with models 2-3 times its size, while the 1.5B model delivers strong performance despite its extremely compact profile. These advances establish new benchmarks for parameter-efficient language modeling in less-represented languages, making high-quality Polish language AI more accessible for resource-constrained applications.
