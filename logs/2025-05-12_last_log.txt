INTRODUCTION OWNSTREAM tasks in 3D computer vision often involve rigid registration step [1][6], which consists of determining 6D rigid transformations to align objects. In the multiview context, the objective is to align set of point clouds, rather than just pair. This paper focuses on objectlevel registration, where each view represents the same object and the objective is to reconstruct an accurate 3D model of this reference [1], [7]. In particular, our primary goal is to address the problem of data acquired in microscopy modality called SMLM (single molecule localization microscopy). The challenge of registration with this data is that the views have undergone very high level of anisotropic noise and outliers, and moderate level of occlusions. This is in contrast with scene-level applications, where the point clouds represent fragments of large-scale scene obtained with LIDAR or RGB-D camera, with very low noise and outliers, but high This work of the Interdisciplinary Thematic Institute HealthTech, as part of the ITI 2021-2028 program of the University of Strasbourg, CNRS and Inserm, was partially supported by IdEx Unistra (ANR-10-IDEX-0002) and SFRI (STRATUS project, ANR-20-SFRI-0012) under the framework of the French Investments for the Future Program. It was also supported by the French National Research Agency (ANR) through the SP-Fluo project (ANR20-CE45-0007). Luc Vedrenne (corresponding author: vedrenne@unistra.fr), Sylvain Faisan, and Denis Fortun are with the ICube Laboratory, IMAGeS team, UMR 7357, CNRS, University of Strasbourg, France. occlusion levels. In what follows, we use the term degradation to refer to the alteration of the shape of point cloud due to noise, occlusions or outliers. Multiview registration methods can be classified into two main categories. The first one, largely predominant, estimates all the pairwise relative motions, and then runs subsequent synchronization algorithm to retrieve absolute poses from all the relative ones [8][16]. This approach has three main limitations: (i) it poorly scales with the number of views, as pN 2q registrations to retrieve absolute poses, it requires in addition to the cost of the synchronization; (ii) all failed pairwise registrations negatively impact the overall result; (iii) each pairwise registration is performed independently, without leveraging informations from other views. The second family of methods is the generative approach: template of the reference object from which the views are observed is estimated, and all the views are registered onto this template [7], [17][24]. This is typically achieved by modeling the template as probability distribution using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), jointly estimated with the absolute poses using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. These generative approaches have the primary benefit of simultaneously registering all point clouds, which mitigates the limitations of the synchronization approach. However, they are only able to converge to local minima, which limits their applicability to refining poses of already coarsely aligned objects. Moreover, they cannot benefit from the robustness and flexibility of point cloud descriptors learned by neural networks. Hence, almost all state-of-the-art multiview registration methods are currently based on synchronization. We propose to revitalize the generative approach by formulating the multiview registration problem entirely in the latent space of an autoencoder, which has been pretrained to reconstruct clean views from degraded ones. The interest is fourfold: (i) as generative approach, it enables the simultaneous registration of numerous views, (ii) the template is modeled by global latent vector learned by deep neural network, which arguably makes it more expressive than the usual mixture of Gaussians, (iii) leveraging global descriptor enables correspondence-free registration, yielding more robustness to noise and occlusion than conventional methods based on feature matching, (iv) the latent space enables faster and more scalable optimization than its ambient counterpart. Moreover, we design loss that takes degradations into account, such that the estimated template is progressively restored during the optimization.

Unlike traditional pairwise registration methods that struggle with scalability, POLAR efficiently handles many views and is robust against significant data degradation. The approach utilizes a pretrained autoencoder to transform the registration task into a latent space, allowing for better optimization. By incorporating a specialized loss function and a multistart optimization strategy, POLAR outperforms existing techniques on both synthetic and real datasets.","title":"POLAR: Efficient and Robust Multiview Point Cloud Registration"}', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, parsed=Article(desc='This paper presents POLAR, a new method for aligning multiple 3D point clouds, which is crucial in computer vision.
