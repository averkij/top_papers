Attention heads provide high-resolution recall, while SSM heads enable efficient context summarization. Additionally, we introduce learnable meta tokens that are prepended to prompts, storing critical information and alleviating the forced-to-attend burden associated with attention mechanisms. This model is further optimized by incorporating cross-layer key-value (KV) sharing and partial sliding window attention, resulting in compact cache size. During development, we conducted controlled study comparing various architectures under identical settings and observed significant advantages of our proposed architecture. Notably, Hymba achieves state-of-the-art results for small LMs: Our Hymba-1.5B-Base model surpasses all sub-2B public models in performance and even outperforms Llama-3.2-3B with 1.32% higher average accuracy, an 11.67 cache size reduction, and 3.49 throughput. Models on Hugging Face: Hymba-1.5B-Base Hymba-1.5B-Instruct 1. Introduction Transformers, with their attention-based architecture, have become the dominant choice for language models (LMs) due to their strong performance, parallelization capabilities, and long-term recall through key-value (KV) caches [1]. However, their quadratic computational cost and high memory demands pose efficiency challenges. In contrast, state space models (SSMs) like Mamba [2] and Mamba-2 [3] offer constant complexity and efficient hardware optimization but struggle with memory recall tasks, affect"

It is widely acknowledged that the performance of Transformer models is exponentially related to their number of parameters and computational complexity. While approaches like Mixture of Experts (MoE) decouple parameter count from computational complexity, they still face challenges in inference due to high memory access costs. This work introduces UltraMem, incorporating large-scale, ultra-sparse memory layer to address these limitations. Our approach significantly reduces inference latency while maintaining model performance. We also investigate the scaling laws of this new architecture, demonstrating that it not only exhibits favorable scaling properties but outperforms traditional models. In our experiments, we train networks with up to 20 million memory slots. The results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art inference speed and model performance within a given computational budget.
