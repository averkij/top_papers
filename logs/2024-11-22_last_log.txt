Building on this momentum, Marco-o1 not only focuses on disciplines with standard answers, such as mathematics, physics, and codingwhich are well-suited for reinforcement learning (RL)but also places greater emphasis on open-ended resolutions. We aim to address the question: Can the o1 model effectively generalize to broader domains where clear standards are absent and rewards are challenging to quantify? Marco-o1 is powered by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), reflection mechanisms, and innovative reasoning strategiesoptimized for complex real-world problem-solving tasks. Figure 1 classic strawberry question reasoned by our Marco-o1 model: How many rs are in strawberry. 1. Introduction OpenAI recently introduced the groundbreaking o1 model [OpenAI, 2024, Zhong et al., 2024], renowned for its exceptional reasoning capabilities. This model has demonstrated outstanding performance on platforms such as AIME and CodeForces, surpassing other leading models. Inspired by this success, we aimed to push the boundaries of LLMs even further, enhancing their reasoning abilities to tackle complex, real-world challenges. Equal Contribution.

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate enhanced capabilities and reliability by reasoning more, evolving from Chain-of-Thought prompting to product-level solutions like OpenAI o1. Despite various efforts to improve LLM reasoning, high-quality long-chain reasoning data and optimized training pipelines still remain inadequately explored in vision-language tasks. In this paper, we present Insight-V, an early effort to 1) scalably produce long and robust reasoning data for complex multi-modal tasks, and 2) an effective training pipeline to enhance the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, to create long and structured reasoning data without human labor, we design a two-step pipeline with a progressive strategy to generate sufficiently long and diverse reasoning paths and a multi-granularity assessment method to ensure data quality. We observe that directly supervising MLLMs with such long and complex reasoning data will not yield ideal reasoning ability. To tackle this problem, we design a multi-agent system consisting of a reasoning agent dedicated to performing long-chain reasoning and a summary agent trained to judge and summarize reasoning results. We further incorporate an iterative DPO algorithm to enhance the reasoning agent's generation stability and quality. Based on the popular LLaVA-NeXT model and our stronger base MLLM, we demonstrate significant performance gains across challenging multi-modal benchmarks requiring visual reasoning. Benefiting from our multi-agent system, Insight-V can also easily maintain or improve performance on perception-focused multi-modal tasks.

Scientific progress depends on researchers' ability to synthesize the growing body of literature. Can large language models (LMs) assist scientists in this task? We introduce OpenScholar, a specialized retrieval-augmented LM that answers scientific queries by identifying relevant passages from 45 million open-access papers and synthesizing citation-backed responses. To evaluate OpenScholar, we develop ScholarQABench, the first large-scale multi-domain benchmark for literature search, comprising 2,967 expert-written queries and 208 long-form answers across computer science, physics, neuroscience, and biomedicine. On ScholarQABench, OpenScholar-8B outperforms GPT-4o by 5% and PaperQA2 by 7% in correctness, despite being a smaller, open model. While GPT4o hallucinates citations 78 to 90% of the time, OpenScholar achieves citation accuracy on par with human experts. OpenScholar's datastore, retriever, and self-feedback inference loop also improves off-the-shelf LMs: for instance, OpenScholar-GPT4o improves GPT-4o's correctness by 12%. In human evaluations, experts preferred OpenScholar-8B and OpenScholar-GPT4o responses over expert-written ones 51% and 70% of the time, respectively, compared to GPT4o's 32%. We open-source all of our code, models, datastore, data and a public demo.

Currently OpenAI o1 has sparked a surge of interest in the study of large reasoning models (LRM). Building on this momentum, Marco-o1 not only focuses on disciplines with standard answers, such as mathematics, physics, and coding -- which are well-suited for reinforcement learning (RL) -- but also places greater emphasis on open-ended resolutions. We aim to address the question: "Can the o1 model effectively generalize to broader domains where clear standards are absent and rewards are challenging to quantify?" Marco-o1 is powered by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), reflection mechanisms, and innovative reasoning strategies -- optimized for complex real-world problem-solving tasks.

"Currently OpenAI o1 has sparked a surge of interest in the study of large reasoning models (LRM). Building on this momentum, Marco-o1 not only focuses on disciplines with standard answers, such as mathematics, physics, and coding -- which are well-suited for reinforcement learning (RL) -- but also places greater emphasis on open-ended resolutions. We aim to address the question: "Can the o1 model effectively generalize to broader domains where clear standards are absent and rewards are challenging to quantify?" Marco-o1 is powered by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), reflection mechanisms, and innovative reasoning strategies -- optimized for complex real-world problem-solving tasks."
