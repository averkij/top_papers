High-quality graphics not only enhance the immersion and realism but also support the narrative, emotional investment, and understanding of the game. In competitive markets where first impressions of the target audience are critical, photorealistic visuals alone can make or break video games success. Despite considerable advances in the computation capabilities of modern hardware and the development of sophisticated computer graphics pipelines with state-of-the-art technologies such as real-time ray tracing and lumen, achieving true photorealism in dynamic and interactive environments continues to be significant challenge. Conventional rendering methods often have to compromise on quality to achieve sufficient performance, particularly in real-time conditions where constant, high enough frame rate is of utmost importance. The are with authors Thessaloniki, University of {pstefanos,nnik}@csd.auth.gr). theof Thessaloniki Informatics, Aristotle (email: 54124, Greece To overcome the limitations of traditional computer graphics pipelines, recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in generative models [1], have opened new opportunities for bridging the gap between games and reality. Image-toImage (Im2Im) translation [2] is an approach that is frequently utilized to enhance the photorealism of rendered images based on target domain of the real world. Im2Im translation can be either paired [3], [4], where models learn from corresponding image pairs, or unpaired [5], [6], [7], where mappings are learned between domains without pixel-level alignment. Since acquiring real-world images that exhibit per-pixel correspondence to the content depicted in the respective rendered game images is hard, for photorealism enhancement, this process is performed in an unpaired manner. The distribution differences in unpaired Im2Im translation between the source (game) and the target (real-world) domains often introduce significant artifacts that undermine player experience [8]. This has resulted in research on more robust unpaired Im2Im translation methods that utilize intermediate information [8], [9], [10]. Such information is employed during image rendering and includes various properties of the virtual environment, such as depth, geometry, and materials. However, these methods have never been applied to video game due to their challenging implementation, which requires access to information that is integrated deep into the engine, and the fact that they are restricted to frame rates of 10 frames per second (FPS) or less. In this paper, we propose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via dual-stage gEnerative Network framework (REGEN), new framework to perform photorealism enhancement in games that is easy to integrate and runs in real-time. In detail, we propose the utilization of robust unpaired Im2Im translation method [8] that can generate highly photorealistic and semantically consistent results in non-real-time. Considering that the generated data perfectly aligns semantically with the initial rendered frames of the game, the task is transformed into paired Im2Im translation [6], [11] problem, which is significantly easier process and thus can be performed effectively, without visual artifacts, with smaller models that can be deployed in real-time. Particularly, we attempt to enhance the photorealism of the popular game Grand Theft Auto (GTA V), which has sold more than 210 million copies. Through experimentation, we illustrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that the proposed approach maintains comparable visual performance with the robust unpaired Im2Im translation method while it reduces the inference time by factor of 32. It is also shown that the approach is more effective compared to performing unpaired Im2Im translation with lightweight model [4] using directly the images from the game and the real world. Our contributions are summarized as follows: 1) We propose novel, publicly available, two-stage framework that employs robust unpaired image-to-image translation model to generate photorealistic pairs in nonreal time, enabling the training of lightweight paired image-to-image translation model for robust real-time photorealism enhancement in games. 2) The introduced framework can be seamlessly integrated into games without requiring access to low-level engine information, which is typically required as input by the current state-of-the-art (SotA) Im2Im translati"

A dual-stage generative network framework enhances photorealism in real-time video game rendering by improving inference speed and visual quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Photorealism is an important aspect of modern video games since it can shape the player experience and simultaneously impact the immersion, narrative engagement, and visual fidelity. Although recent hardware technological breakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have significantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true photorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a major challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance. In this short paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing the photorealism of rendered game frames using generative adversarial networks. To this end, we propose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative Network framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image translation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that transform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task. This enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time inference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach achieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired Im2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also indicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced by directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to translate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of real-world images. Code, pre-trained models, and demos for this work are available at: https://github.com/stefanos50/REGEN.
