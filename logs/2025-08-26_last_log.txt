We describe the challenges encountered during data curation, synthesis, training, and evaluation, and outline the solutions employed to address these challenges at scale. We comprehensively evaluate across mathematical reasoning, coding, knowledge, comprehension, and alignment benchmarks, and we report both quantitative performance and qualitative behavioral analysis. To support open research, all model weights are published publicly at https://huggingface.co/NousResearch2.LLMs, at this point, need no introduction. Their effectiveness at approximating aspects of human cognition despite comparatively simple training objectives has made them subject of both academic investigation and practical deployment. In recent years, growing body of work has explored inference-time scaling mechanisms (often described as reasoner" models) which dynamically adjust the amount of computation devoted to solving task [35, 15]. Initially, reasoner models were available only from proprietary providers. More recently, number of open-weight reasoning systems have been released, enabling the community to study, evaluate, and improve upon these methods in an open setting [57, 15, 48]. In this report we introduce Hermes 4, family of neutrally-aligned generalist models trained to integrate self-reflective reasoning with broad instructional competence. The contributions of this work are threefold: data synthesis and curation strategy that produces large-scale hybrid dataset consisting of both reasoning-focused and general purpose instruction examples (Section2); training methodology that incorporates loss-masking, length-control fine-tuning, and efficient packing strategies for large-scale heterogeneous data (Section 3); Correspondence to teknium@nousresearch.com. 2https://huggingface.co/collections/NousResearch/hermes-4-collection-68a731bfd452e20816725728 Hermes 4 Technical Report comprehensive evaluation across reasoning, code, knowledge, alignment, and qualitative benchmarks (Section 4, 5). Together, these contributions demonstrate how open-weight reasoning models can be effectively trained and rigorously evaluated, yielding models that are comparable to frontier systems while remaining transparent and reproducible.The Hermes 4 dataset consists primarily of newly synthesized reasoning and non-reasoning data, totaling approximately 5 million samples and 19 billion tokens. It was designed to imbue the model with advanced reasoning capabilities while maintaining broad base of general knowledge and instruction-following proficiency. The data strategy focused on hybrid approach, combining substantial volume of reasoning-focused data with diverse set of non-reasoning instructions. The dataset is composite of 3.5 million reasoning samples and 1.6 million non-reasoning samples. significant portion of the Hermes 3 [51] dataset3 was retained to ensure continuity in the models capabilities. The reasoning samples were intentionally token-heavy, with an average of five times more tokens per sample than their non-reasoning counterparts, accommodating thinking traces up to 16 thousand tokens long.We process pre-training seed data through graph-based synthetic data generator called DataForge. Inspired by AgentInstruct [31] , DataForge generates conversational data across wide variety of tasks. Each datapoint is generated via random walk through directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node implements struct struct map. Specifically, each node implements the PDDL [9] action interface, defining preconditions and postconditions which determine data flow. The edges in this DAG are thus implicit, i.e. directed edge exists from node to node if and only if the postconditions guaranteed by satisfy the preconditions of B. This design enables declarative construction of agent graphs, facilitating the specification of large and complex structures. We show an example graph in Figure 1 for single-turn QA data."

Stevens , Oisín Nolan , and Ruud J.G. van Sloun Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands {t.s.w.stevens,o.i.nolan,r.j.g.v.sloun}@tue.nl Abstract. Echocardiography plays central role in cardiac imaging, offering dynamic views of the heart that are essential for diagnosis and monitoring. However, image quality can be significantly degraded by haze arising from multipath reverberations, particularly in difficult-to-image patients. In this work, we propose semantic-guided, diffusion-based dehazing algorithm developed for the MICCAI Dehazing Echocardiography Challenge (DehazingEcho2025). Our method integrates pixel-wise noise model, derived from semantic segmentation of hazy inputs into diffusion posterior sampling framework guided by generative prior trained on clean ultrasound data. Quantitative evaluation on the challenge dataset demonstrates strong performance across contrast and fidelity metrics. Code for the submitted algorithm is available on GitHub.1. Keywords: Cardiac Ultrasound Imaging Dehazing Diffusion Models. Ultrasound is popular modality for cardiac imaging due to its high temporal resolution, cost effectiveness, and real-time imaging capabilities, enabling the detection of variety of cardiac abnormalities [2]. An ongoing challenge in echocardiography is that of clutter or haze resulting from multipath reverberations [12,14], which can prevent accurate measurement from B-Mode images. This has motivated the development dehazing algorithms, which aim to recover clean images from hazy input images y. Recently, number of dehazing algorithms leveraging deep generative models (DGMs) have been proposed, using prior knowledge of the clean image distribution to infer sets of clean images corresponding to observed hazy images. One such approach involves using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to perform domain adaptation, wherein the style of one dataset is transferred to samples from anoth"
