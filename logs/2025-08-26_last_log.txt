Text:"5 2 0 2 2 2 ] . [ 1 7 7 5 6 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r MV-RAG: Retrieval Augmented Multiview DiffusionFigure 1: We introduce retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for text-to-multiview generation. Given text prompt, our method retrieves real-world images and adaptively leverages them together with the text, enabling faithful generation of out-of-distribution and newly emerging objects.Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose MV-RAG, novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images from large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions multiview diffusion model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs. Training such retrievalconditioned model is achieved via novel hybrid strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections. This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using distinctive held-out view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate rigorous OOD evaluation, we introduce new collection of challenging OOD prompts. Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks. Project page: https://yosefdayani.github.io/MV-RAG/ Preprint. Under review.The automated generation of 3D content from textual descriptions is task of great practical importance for various downstream applications, including game modeling [11, 22], computer animation [36, 21], and virtual reality [46]. Current state-of-the-art approaches predominantly leverage powerful, pre-trained 2D text-to-image diffusion models [55, 13] as strong visual and semantic priors, either by optimization [37, 26, 25] or by using them to train generative models that synthesize consistent multiview images [29, 53, 32]. Indeed, such approaches result in high-quality outputs for diverse set of objects and scenes. However, they often falter when confronted with text prompts describing out-of-domain (OOD) or rare entities; in these settings, they often yield geometrically inconsistent results (e.g., poorly rendered unseen regions) or fail to adhere to the text, hallucinating details or substituting rare concepts with common ones. dominant text-to-3D approach leverages 2D priors via optimization, such as Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) [37, 26, 25]. These methods typically optimize 3D representation, such as NeRF [34], by distilling knowledge from pre-trained 2D text-to-image models. While producing high-fidelity results, SDS-based methods often struggle with geometric consistency and often inherit the 2D priors failures on OOD/rare prompts, yielding flawed 3D assets. To mitigate such issues, recent efforts [48, 5] have explored retrieval augmentation within this optimization paradigm by retrieving existing 3D assets to provide explicit geometric priors during the generation. This enhances consistency for concepts in the 3D retrieval database but is limited by its scarce scale and diversity. Another avenue involves 3D personalization techniques like DreamBooth3D [40], which first adapts pretrained 2D text-to-image model to specific subject using few (3-6) user-provided images, and then applies SDS-based optimization. These methods excel at capturing subject-specific details but primarily operate via inference-time fine-tuning for each individual instance. Crucially, such lifting approaches still suffer from the inherent 3D geometry inconsistency and the optimization time of SDS-based approaches. An alternative strategy to direct 3D optimization involves feed-forward approaches, particularly multi-view diffusion models [53, 29, 32]. These models aim to synthesize consistent set of multi-view images from given input (text or image), which can subsequently be employed for 3D reconstruction. Many such models are fine-tuned from general-purpose 2D diffusion backbones using large-scale 3D datasets such as Objaverse [8], thereby enhancing their 3D awareness and enabling more stable and geometrically consistent generation compared to earlier 2D-lifting approaches. Despite these advances, such models exhibit pronounced limitations when confronted with outof-domain (OOD) or infrequent visual concepts. These challenges can be attributed to two main factors: (1) foundational 2D diffusion models, often used as the initialization point, may offer incomplete or biased representations of atypical concepts, and (2) the 3D datasets employed for finetuning, while extensive, often lack sufficient coverage, diversity, or geometric fidelity for uncommon entities. Consequently, these models tend to produce outputs with reduced photorealism, diminished multi-view consistency, or poor handling of unobserved regions when prompted with rare or novel concepts. To this end, we develop multiview diffusion model, MV-RAG, that, guided by an input text prompt, can also effectively condition its output on set of relevant 2D images retrieved based on that text, ultimately producing consistent set of multiview images that reflect the prompts content. Our training strategy uniquely combines two sources of supervision: high-quality multiview images derived from structured 3D datasets, and diverse images sourced from large-scale 2D text-image collections. When training with multiview 3D data, we note that real-world images retrieved for given text might look very different from the target multiview ground truth. To simulate retrieval variance, we augment ground truth multiview images (geometrically and semantically) creating diverse, "retrieval-like" conditioning views. Our model then learns to reconstruct the original scene, where the generation of each target view is guided explicitly by attending to visual tokens encoded from retrieved images. This allows for fine-grained conditioning based on these simulated retrieved inputs. To incorporate supervision from 2D data, we utilize +1 images that "

"MV-RAG enhances text-to-3D generation by retrieving 2D images and conditioning a multiview diffusion model to improve consistency and accuracy, especially for out-of-domain concepts.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs. Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections. This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts. Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks."

MEENA, a Persian-English dataset, evaluates vision-language models across scientific, reasoning, and human-level understanding tasks, enhancing capabilities beyond English.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in large vision-language models (VLMs) have primarily focused on English, with limited attention given to other languages. To address this gap, we introduce MEENA (also known as PersianMMMU), the first dataset designed to evaluate Persian VLMs across scientific, reasoning, and human-level understanding tasks. Our dataset comprises approximately 7,500 Persian and 3,000 English questions, covering a wide range of topics such as reasoning, mathematics, physics, diagrams, charts, and Persian art and literature. Key features of MEENA include: (1) diverse subject coverage spanning various educational levels, from primary to upper secondary school, (2) rich metadata, including difficulty levels and descriptive answers, (3) original Persian data that preserves cultural nuances, (4) a bilingual structure to assess cross-linguistic performance, and (5) a series of diverse experiments assessing various capabilities, including overall performance, the model's ability to attend to images, and its tendency to generate hallucinations. We hope this benchmark contributes to enhancing VLM capabilities beyond English.
