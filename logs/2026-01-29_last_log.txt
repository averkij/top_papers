Text:"Training Reasoning Models on Saturated Problems via Failure-Prefix Conditioning Minwu Kim 1 Safal Shrestha 1 Keith RossReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet training often stalls as problems become saturated. We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failureprone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the models robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems.1. 6 2 0 2 8 2 ] . [ 1 9 2 8 0 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r 1. Introduction Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially improved the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) (Lambert et al., 2025; Guo 1New York University Abu Dhabi. Correspondence to: Minwu Kim <mwk300@nyu.edu>. Preprint. January 29, 2026. 1Code available at https://github.com/minwukim/ training-on-saturated-problems 1 Figure 1. Illustration of standard GRPO training and failure-prefix conditioning on saturated problems. While standard GRPO predominantly generates correct rollouts, failure-prefix conditioning exposes the model to failure-prone reasoning states, making informative failures more accessible. et al., 2025; OpenAI, 2024). However, as models improve, an increasing number of training problems become saturated, meaning the model solves them correctly in nearly all rollouts. On these problems, training often stalls because rewards become nearly deterministic, leaving little learning signals. Importantly, saturation does not imply that the learning signal is exhausted. Even on problems with near-perfect rollout accuracy, incorrect reasoning trajectories still exist, albeit extremely rarely under standard sampling. As established in prior work, such informative failures play crucial role in training (Setlur et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025b). However, most of the sampling budget is spent generating redundant correct solutions, with failures becoming exceedingly sparse (Wang et al., 2025). This suggests that the core challenge in learning from satTraining Reasoning Models on Saturated Problems via Failure-Prefix Conditioning urated problems is not the absence of informative failures, but their poor accessibility. If failures could be encountered more frequently, RLVR could continue to make progress even on saturated problems. To this end, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems in RLVR. As shown in Figure 1, instead of sampling from the original question, this method explicitly targets failureprone reasoning states. We identify rare incorrect rollouts from saturated questions, slice them into prefixes, and select the specific prefix lengths that maximize the learning signal (i.e., target accuracy τ = 0.5) (Li et al., 2025). Training on the resulting failure-prefix-conditioned dataset reallocates exploration toward failure-prone regions of the response space, enabling effective learning from saturated problems. We validate the effectiveness of this approach through an in-depth experimental study. Using DeepSeek-R1-DistillQwen-1.5B (Guo et al., 2025) as our base model, we identify 1,000 saturated math questions where the model achieves rollout accuracy 31/32 ( 97%). We apply failure-prefix conditioning to these questions and train our failure-prefix model using RLVR on the resulting prefix-conditioned dataset. We compare our approach against two baselines: (i) the saturate model, trained via standard RLVR on the same 1,000 saturated questions without prefix conditioning, and (ii) the medium model, trained with standard RLVR on 1,000 medium-difficulty questions with rollout accuracy close to 50%, the regime commonly regarded as maximizes the learning signal (Zhan et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025). We evaluate these models on various math reasoning benchmarks spanning wide range of difficulty. The saturate model shows negligible improvement relative to the base model, confirming that standard RLVR training stalls on saturated questions. In contrast, training on the failure-prefixconditioned dataset yields consistent and substantial gains over the base model across all benchmarks. This performance is on par with that of the medium model, demonstrating that failure-prefix conditioning can effectively recover learning signal from saturated problems. Notably, these improvements are achieved without inflating response length, indicating that our methodology preserves token efficiency. We also demonstrate that our approach is robust to the target accuracy hyperparameter τ ; while our default τ = 0.5 yields the best performance, ablation studies confirm that the method achieves comparable peak performance across range of values. Next, we analyze why failure-prefix conditioning is effective. While standard RLVR primarily incentivizes better decision-making from the initial state, failure-prefix conditioning explicitly trains the model to recover from incorrect intermediate reasoning states. Consequently, the method promotes robustness to misleading partial trajectories early in the reasoning process. Empirically, we find that the failure-prefix model exhibits greater robustness to failure prefixes, showing smaller drop in rollout accuracy compared to baseline methods. Additionally, we also observe mild trade-off, where improved robustness to failure prefixes can occasionally reduce adherence to correct intermediate reasoning. Finally, we explore whether learning from saturated pro"

Failure-prefix conditioning enables more effective reinforcement learning from saturated problems by focusing exploration on informative failure trajectories, maintaining token efficiency while improving robustness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet training often stalls as problems become saturated. We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems.

Суть подхода заключается в переориентации исследовательского процесса путём кондиционирования на префиксах из редких ошибочных траекторий, что позволяет модели столкиваться с состояниями, склонными к ошибкам. Метод достигает прироста производительности, эквивалентного обучению на задачах средней сложности, при этом сохраняя эффективность использования токенов. Авторы также демонстрируют, что итеративное обновление префиксов ошибок во время обучения позволяет продолжить улучшение после выхода на плато производительности.",
