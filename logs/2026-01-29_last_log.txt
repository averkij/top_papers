We are currently witnessing paradigm shift in generative models, transitioning from static text-to-video generation [79, 64] to the more ambitious goal of text-to-world simulation [2, 5, 24, 27, 28, 45, 53, 68, 69, 73, 74]. While state-of-the-art video generation models [25, 63, 71, 72, 77, 90] have achieved remarkable fidelity in rendering short, visually coherent clips, they fundamentally remain dreamers rather than simulators [9, 35]. They hallucinate pixel transitions based on statistical correlations but often lack grounded understanding of the underlying laws, such as causality, object permanence, and the consequences of interaction. Bridging this gap makes it essential to transition from generating passive footage to building world models capable of synthesizing persistent, interactive, and logically consistent environments. However, the transition from video generation to world simulation [1, 27, 78, 80, 89] faces significant challenges. First, high-quality interactive data are scarce; unlike passive web videos, data that captures the complex interplay between an agents decisions and the environments reaction is notoriously difficult to scale [22, 48]. Second, maintaining narrative and structural coherence over minute-long trajectories rather than mere secondsremains an unsolved challenge for standard diffusion architectures, which suffer from catastrophic forgetting [7, 8]. Finally, the computational prohibitiveness of traditional diffusion sampling makes live control impossible, limiting most existing models to offline rendering rather than real-time interaction. Furthermore, the most advanced solutions in this space remain proprietary, creating divide that hinders broader community innovation. In this report, we present LingBot-World, comprehensive, open-source framework designed to shatter these barriers and democratize the research of large-scale world models. LingBot-World is not merely generative model; it is holistic system engineered to learn the dynamics of virtual worlds and render them in real-time. LingBot-World is founded upon three strategic pillars that distinguish our model from existing solutions: scalable data engine with hierarchical semantics. We address the data bottleneck by constructing hybrid engine that ingests diverse data sources, including real-world footage, game engine recordings, and synthetic data from Unreal Engine. Crucially, to solve the lack of fine-grained control in raw data, we introduce hierarchical captioning strategy [15, 16, 82]. By generating distinct narrative, scene-static, and dense temporal captions, we effectively disentangle motion control from static scene generation, allowing the model to learn precise action-contingent dynamics. multi-stage evolutionary training pipeline. We propose progressive training strategy to evolve foundation video generator into an interactive simulator, including three stages: pre-training, middle-training, and posttraining. In stage I, robust general video prior is established via pre-training to support high-fidelity texture generation. In stage II, or middle-training, we employ mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture [17, 19, 36, 77] to incorporate world knowledge and enable action controllability, focusing on long-term memory and maintaining environmental consistency over extended horizons. In stage III, we optimize the model for real-time inference. Through causal attention adaptation and few-step distillation [44, 59, 65], the bidirectional diffusion model is post-trained into an efficient autoregressive system [10, 30] with sub-second latency. Versatile applications for embodied AI. Beyond visual synthesis, LingBot-World serves as practical testbed for downstreams [1, 6, 20, 26, 29, 57, 58, 78, 92]. It supports promptable world events, allowing users to semantically steer global conditions and local dynamics via textual prompts. Furthermore, it facilitates the training of action agents and enables consistent 3D reconstruction from generated videos [34, 50, 83], validating its geometric integrity. To contextualize our contribution, Tab. 1 compares LingBot-World with recent interactive world models. While systems like Genie 3 [5] and Mirage 2 [73] have made strides, they often compromise on dynamic degree or remain closed-source. LingBot-World distinguishes itself by offering general domain capability, long generation horizon, and high dynamic degree in real-time, all while being fully open-source. By releasing the code and model weights, we aim to ignite new wave of innovation, empowering the community to build the next generation of virtual worlds. By open-sourcing LingBot-World, including our model weights and inference codebase, we aim to ignite new wave of innovation. We invi"

Text:"GDCNET: GENERATIVE DISCREPANCY COMPARISON NETWORK FOR MULTIMODAL SARCASM DETECTION Shuguang Zhang1,2, Junhong Lian1,2, Guoxin Yu1,2,3, Baoxun Xu4, Xiang Ao1,2 1 State Key Laboratory of AI Safety, Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) 2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS 3 Pengcheng Laboratory 4 Shenzhen Stock Exchange 6 2 0 J 8 2 ] . [ 1 8 1 6 0 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r ABSTRACT Multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) aims to identify sarcasm within imagetext pairs by modeling semantic incongruities across modalities. Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity. These discrepancy features are then fused with visual and textual representations via gated module to adaptively balance modality contributions. Extensive experiments on MSD benchmarks demonstrate GDCNets superior accuracy and robustness, establishing new state-of-the-art on the MMSD2.0 benchmark. Index Terms Multimodal sarcasm detection, discrepancy generation, multimodal representation enhancement 1. INTRODUCTION Sarcasm is linguistic phenomenon in which the surface meaning of an utterance diverges significantly from the speakers intended communicative message. It is commonly employed for humor, critique, and subtle social commen"

Text:"RIR-Mega-Speech: Reverberant Speech Corpus with Comprehensive Acoustic Metadata and Reproducible Evaluation Mandip Goswami1 1Acoustics Researcher, mandipgoswami@gmail.commDespite decades of research on reverberant speech, comparing methods remains difficult because most corpora lack per-file acoustic annotations or provide limited documentation for reproduction. We present RIR-Mega-Speech, corpus of approximately 117.5 hours created by convolving LibriSpeech utterances with roughly 5,000 simulated room impulse responses from the RIR-Mega collection. Every file includes RT60, direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity index (C50) computed from the source RIR using clearly defined, reproducible procedures. We also provide scripts to rebuild the dataset and reproduce all evaluation results. Using Whisper small on 1,500 paired utterances, we measure 5.20% WER (95% CI: 4.695.78) on clean speech and 7.70% (7.048.35) on reverberant versions, corresponding to paired increase of 2.50 percentage points (2.062.98). This represents 48% relative degradation. WER increases monotonically with RT60 and decreases with DRR, consistent with prior perceptual studies. While the core finding that reverberation harms recognition is well established, we aim to provide the community with standardized resource where acoustic conditions are transparent and results can be verified independently. The repository includes one-command rebuild instructions for both Windows and Linux environments. Index Terms: reverberant speech, room impulse response, simulated acoustics, speech recognition, reproducibility 1. Introduction Reverberation continues to degrade automatic speech recognition in real-world conditions. The problem is late reflections smear temporal structure straightforward: and reduce the clarity of phonetic cues. Self-supervised models have improved robustness to some channel effects, but rooms with long decay times or weak direct paths still cause errors. The challenge for research is not just building better models but doing it in way that others can verify. Many existing reverberant corpora either lack per-file acoustic labels, use proprietary RIRs that cannot be redistributed, or provide limited documentation for reproducing evaluations. This makes it hard to compare results across papers or understand whether improvements generalize. Our contribution is corpus with three specific properties. First, every reverberant file has associated RT60, DRR, and C50 values computed from the source RIR. Second, we provide complete code to regenerate the audio, compute all metrics, and reproduce the evaluation results in this paper. Third, we report confidence intervals using nonparametric bootstrap at the utterance level and use paired tests where applicable. We are not claiming algorithmic novelty or surprising acoustic insights. The fact that higher RT60 increases WER is not new. What we offer is standardized resource where the conditions are documented and the results are checkable. Section 2 reviews related corpora. Section 3 describes the construction process. Sections 4 and 5 present the evaluation setup and results. Section 6 discusses limitations and future directions. 2. Related Work 2.1. Reverberant Speech Corpora The REVERB Challenge [1] remains widely used benchmark. It includes real room recordings and simulated reverberant speech with RT60 ranging from 0.25 to 0.7 seconds. Paired clean and reverberant data are provided, and evaluation scripts are available. However, per-file acoustic metadata is not included in the released annotations, which limits post-hoc analysis by acoustic condition. The CHiME series [2, 3] has focused on noisy and reverberant multi-channel speech. CHiME-5 and CHiME-6 include real dinner party recordings with substantial reverberation. The acoustic conditions vary naturally but are not systematically annotated with RT60 or DRR per utterance. Simulated training data in some tracks does include controlled reverberation, but the focus is on the challenge task rather than releasing general-purpose annotated corpus. AISHELL-4 [4] provides Mandarin meeting speech with reverberation and overlapping speakers. The conference room setting introduces moderate RT60, but again, detailed acoustic parameters are not provided per file. Similar limitations apply to other meeting corpora like AMI [5]. The Acoustic Echo Cancellation Challenge [7] and the Deep Noise Suppression Challenge [8] release large sets of RIRs and noise files. These are valuable for data augmentation but are not paired with transcribed speech in ready-to-use format. Users must perform convolution and manage metadata themselves. Several VCTK-based reverberant datasets exist [9, 10], typically created by convolving VCTK utterances with simulated or measured RIRs. These are often used for speech enhancement evaluation. They provide clean-reverberant pairs but usually lack comprehensive per-file acoustic annotations or systematic coverage analysis. 2.2. Acoustic Measures in Speech Research RT60, introduced by Sabine [11], quantifies how long it takes for sound energy to decay by 60 dB. Schroeder [12] developed the integrated impulse response method, which is now standard for estimating RT60 from measured RIRs. The direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR) captures the balance between direct sound and reflected energy [13]. Clarity 6 2 0 2 J 5 2 ] . e [ 1 9 4 9 9 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r metrics like C50 and C80 [14] are widely used in room acoustics to predict speech intelligibility. Prior work has established that RT60 above 0.5 seconds typically reduces intelligibility [15], and that DRR below 0 dB makes speech difficult to understand [16]. Our evaluation confirms that these trends also appear in ASR error rates with modern neural models. 2.3. Reproducibility in Speech Research Recent discussions at ISCA workshops and in journals like Speech Communication have emphasized the need for reproducible research [17]. Releasing code is now common, but releasing the exact data and scripts needed to recreate figures and tables is less so. Our approach follows examples from computer vision [18] and NLP [19], where benchmark datasets come with standardized evaluation protocols and leaderboards. 3. Dataset Construction 3.1.

In this report, we present OmegaUse, general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computeruse and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce carefully engineered dataconstruction pipeline and decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OSNav, benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu.

Text:"SE-DICOW: SELF-ENROLLED DIARIZATION-CONDITIONED WHISPER Alexander Polok Dominik Klement Samuele Cornell Matthew Wiesner Jan ˇCernocky Sanjeev Khudanpur Speech@FIT, Brno University of Technology, Czechia Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, USA CLSP & HLTCOE, Johns Hopkins University, USA Lukaˇs Burget 6 2 0 2 7 2 ] . e [ 1 4 9 1 9 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r ABSTRACT Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (ASR) in multispeaker environments remains major challenge. While some approaches achieve strong performance when fine-tuned on specific domains, few systems generalize well across out-of-domain datasets. Our prior work, Diarization-Conditioned Whisper (DiCoW), leverages speaker diarization outputs as conditioning information and, with minimal fine-tuning, demonstrated strong multilingual and multi-domain performance. In this paper, we address key limitation of DiCoW: ambiguity in SilenceTargetNon-targetOverlap (STNO) masks, where two or more fully overlapping speakers may have nearly identical conditioning despite differing transcriptions. We introduce SE-DiCoW (Self-Enrolled Diarization-Conditioned Whisper), which uses diarization output to locate an enrollment segment anywhere in the conversation where the target speaker is most active. This enrollment segment is used as fixed conditioning via cross-attention at each encoder layer. We further refine DiCoW with improved data segmentation, model initialization, and augmentation. Together, these advances yield substantial gains: SE-DiCoW reduces macro-averaged tcpWER by 52.4% relative to the original DiCoW on the EMMA MT-ASR benchmark. Index Terms target-speaker ASR, DiCoW, diarization conditioning, multi-speaker ASR, Whisper 1. INTRODUCTION Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for applications such as meetings, interviews, and other multi-party conversations, where transcripts must capture who spoke what.

MathForge enhances mathematical reasoning in large models through a dual framework combining difficulty-aware policy optimization and multi-aspect question reformulation to address limitations in existing reinforcement learning methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a robust mechanism for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large models. However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks.

DeepSeek-OCR 2 introduces DeepEncoder V2 that dynamically reorders visual tokens based on semantic content, enabling more human-like causal reasoning in 2D image understanding through cascaded 1D causal structures.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present DeepSeek-OCR 2 to investigate the feasibility of a novel encoder-DeepEncoder V2-capable of dynamically reordering visual tokens upon image semantics. Conventional vision-language models (VLMs) invariably process visual tokens in a rigid raster-scan order (top-left to bottom-right) with fixed positional encoding when fed into LLMs. However, this contradicts human visual perception, which follows flexible yet semantically coherent scanning patterns driven by inherent logical structures. Particularly for images with complex layouts, human vision exhibits causally-informed sequential processing. Inspired by this cognitive mechanism, DeepEncoder V2 is designed to endow the encoder with causal reasoning capabilities, enabling it to intelligently reorder visual tokens prior to LLM-based content interpretation. This work explores a novel paradigm: whether 2D image understanding can be effectively achieved through two-cascaded 1D causal reasoning structures, thereby offering a new architectural approach with the potential to achieve genuine 2D reasoning.

Spark is a reinforcement learning framework that strategically allocates computational resources by branching at critical decision states, improving sample efficiency and generalization for long-horizon tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning has empowered large language models to act as intelligent agents, yet training them for long-horizon tasks remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality trajectories, especially under limited resources. Existing methods typically scale up rollout sizes and indiscriminately allocate computational resources among intermediate steps. Such attempts inherently waste substantial computation budget on trivial steps while failing to guarantee sample quality. To address this, we propose Spark (Strategic Policy-Aware exploRation via Key-state dynamic branching), a novel framework that selectively branches at critical decision states for resource-efficient exploration. Our key insight is to activate adaptive branching exploration at critical decision points to probe promising trajectories, thereby achieving precise resource allocation that prioritizes sampling quality over blind coverage. This design leverages the agent's intrinsic decision-making signals to reduce dependence on human priors, enabling the agent to autonomously expand exploration and achieve stronger generalization. Experiments across diverse tasks (e.g., embodied planning), demonstrate that Spark achieves superior success rates with significantly fewer training samples, exhibiting robust generalization even in unseen scenarios.

Linear representation directions in language models dynamically shift during conversations, affecting how factual information is encoded while preserving generic content, with implications for interpretability and context-adaptive model behavior.  					AI-generated summary 				 Language model representations often contain linear directions that correspond to high-level concepts. Here, we study the dynamics of these representations: how representations evolve along these dimensions within the context of (simulated) conversations. We find that linear representations can change dramatically over a conversation; for example, information that is represented as factual at the beginning of a conversation can be represented as non-factual at the end and vice versa. These changes are content-dependent; while representations of conversation-relevant information may change, generic information is generally preserved. These changes are robust even for dimensions that disentangle factuality from more superficial response patterns, and occur across different model families and layers of the model. These representation changes do not require on-policy conversations; even replaying a conversation script written by an entirely different model can produce similar changes. However, adaptation is much weaker from simply having a sci-fi story in context that is framed more explicitly as such. We also show that steering along a representational direction can have dramatically different effects at different points in a conversation. These results are consistent with the idea that representations may evolve in response to the model playing a particular role that is cued by a conversation. Our findings may pose challenges for interpretability and steering -- in particular, they imply that it may be misleading to use static interpretations of features or directions, or probes that assume a particular range of features consistently corresponds to a particular ground-truth value. However, these types of representational dynamics also point to exciting new research directions for understanding how models adapt to context.

"Linear representation directions in language models dynamically shift during conversations, affecting how factual information is encoded while preserving generic content, with implications for interpretability and context-adaptive model behavior.  					AI-generated summary 				 Language model representations often contain linear directions that correspond to high-level concepts. Here, we study the dynamics of these representations: how representations evolve along these dimensions within the context of (simulated) conversations. We find that linear representations can change dramatically over a conversation; for example, information that is represented as factual at the beginning of a conversation can be represented as non-factual at the end and vice versa. These changes are content-dependent; while representations of conversation-relevant information may change, generic information is generally preserved. These changes are robust even for dimensions that disentangle factuality from more superficial response patterns, and occur across different model families and layers of the model. These representation changes do not require on-policy conversations; even replaying a conversation script written by an entirely different model can produce similar changes. However, adaptation is much weaker from simply having a sci-fi story in context that is framed more explicitly as such. We also show that steering along a representational direction can have dramatically different effects at different points in a conversation. These results are consistent with the idea that representations may evolve in response to the model playing a particular role that is cued by a conversation. Our findings may pose challenges for interpretability and steering -- in particular, they imply that it may be misleading to use static interpretations of features or directions, or probes that assume a particular range of features consistently corresponds to a particular ground-truth value. However, these types of representational dynamics also point to exciting new research directions for understanding how models adapt to context."

Soft-Verified Efficient Repository Agents (SERA) enables cost-effective training of coding agents through supervised fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance while enabling specialization to private codebases at a fraction of the cost of previous methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Open-weight coding agents should hold a fundamental advantage over closed-source systems: they can be specialized to private codebases, encoding repository-specific information directly in their weights. Yet the cost and complexity of training has kept this advantage theoretical. We show it is now practical. We present Soft-Verified Efficient Repository Agents (SERA), an efficient method for training coding agents that enables the rapid and cheap creation of agents specialized to private codebases. Using only supervised finetuning (SFT), SERA achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open-source (open data, method, code) models while matching the performance of frontier open-weight models like Devstral-Small-2. Creating SERA models is 26x cheaper than reinforcement learning and 57x cheaper than previous synthetic data methods to reach equivalent performance. Our method, Soft Verified Generation (SVG), generates thousands of trajectories from a single code repository. Combined with cost-efficiency, this enables specialization to private codebases. Beyond repository specialization, we apply SVG to a larger corpus of codebases, generating over 200,000 synthetic trajectories. We use this dataset to provide detailed analysis of scaling laws, ablations, and confounding factors for training coding agents. Overall, we believe our work will greatly accelerate research on open coding agents and showcase the advantage of open-source models that can specialize to private codebases. We release SERA as the first model in Ai2's Open Coding Agents series, along with all our code, data, and Claude Code integration to support the research community.

Innovator-VL demonstrates that principled training design and transparent methodology can achieve strong scientific intelligence with reduced data requirements while maintaining general vision performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Innovator-VL, a scientific multimodal large language model designed to advance understanding and reasoning across diverse scientific domains while maintaining excellent performance on general vision tasks. Contrary to the trend of relying on massive domain-specific pretraining and opaque pipelines, our work demonstrates that principled training design and transparent methodology can yield strong scientific intelligence with substantially reduced data requirements. (i) First, we provide a fully transparent, end-to-end reproducible training pipeline, covering data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and evaluation, along with detailed optimization recipes. This facilitates systematic extension by the community. (ii) Second, Innovator-VL exhibits remarkable data efficiency, achieving competitive performance on various scientific tasks using fewer than five million curated samples without large-scale pretraining. These results highlight that effective reasoning can be achieved through principled data selection rather than indiscriminate scaling. (iii) Third, Innovator-VL demonstrates strong generalization, achieving competitive performance on general vision, multimodal reasoning, and scientific benchmarks. This indicates that scientific alignment can be integrated into a unified model without compromising general-purpose capabilities. Our practices suggest that efficient, reproducible, and high-performing scientific multimodal models can be built even without large-scale data, providing a practical foundation for future research.

A multimodal sarcasm detection approach uses generative models to create stable semantic anchors and measures cross-modal discrepancies for improved accuracy and robustness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) aims to identify sarcasm within image-text pairs by modeling semantic incongruities across modalities. Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity. These discrepancy features are then fused with visual and textual representations via a gated module to adaptively balance modality contributions. Extensive experiments on MSD benchmarks demonstrate GDCNet's superior accuracy and robustness, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the MMSD2.0 benchmark.

**Reasoning:** The paper addresses the issue of noise and unreliability introduced by generative models (LLMs/MLLMs) in the context of sarcasm detection. The core problem being solved is that "the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise," which relates to hallucinations and the unreliable outputs of generative models. The proposed solution uses "stable semantic anchors" from MLLMs to mitigate this issue, which is directly relevant to hallucination mitigation.

A large-scale reverberant speech corpus with detailed acoustic annotations is introduced to facilitate standardized comparison and reproduction of speech processing research.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite decades of research on reverberant speech, comparing methods remains difficult because most corpora lack per-file acoustic annotations or provide limited documentation for reproduction. We present RIR-Mega-Speech, a corpus of approximately 117.5 hours created by convolving LibriSpeech utterances with roughly 5,000 simulated room impulse responses from the RIR-Mega collection. Every file includes RT60, direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity index (C_{50}) computed from the source RIR using clearly defined, reproducible procedures. We also provide scripts to rebuild the dataset and reproduce all evaluation results.   Using Whisper small on 1,500 paired utterances, we measure 5.20% WER (95% CI: 4.69--5.78) on clean speech and 7.70% (7.04--8.35) on reverberant versions, corresponding to a paired increase of 2.50 percentage points (2.06--2.98). This represents a 48% relative degradation. WER increases monotonically with RT60 and decreases with DRR, consistent with prior perceptual studies. While the core finding that reverberation harms recognition is well established, we aim to provide the community with a standardized resource where acoustic conditions are transparent and results can be verified independently. The repository includes one-command rebuild instructions for both Windows and Linux environments.

Free-form sketching enables intuitive dynamic intent communication for automated content creation, bridging human intention and digital output in animation workflows.  					AI-generated summary 				 Sketching provides an intuitive way to convey dynamic intent in animation authoring (i.e., how elements change over time and space), making it a natural medium for automatic content creation. Yet existing approaches often constrain sketches to fixed command tokens or predefined visual forms, overlooking their freeform nature and the central role of humans in shaping intention. To address this, we introduce an interaction paradigm where users convey dynamic intent to a vision-language model via free-form sketching, instantiated here in a sketch storyboard to motion graphics workflow. We implement an interface and improve it through a three-stage study with 24 participants. The study shows how sketches convey motion with minimal input, how their inherent ambiguity requires users to be involved for clarification, and how sketches can visually guide video refinement. Our findings reveal the potential of sketch and AI interaction to bridge the gap between intention and outcome, and demonstrate its applicability to 3D animation and video generation.

"Free-form sketching enables intuitive dynamic intent communication for automated content creation, bridging human intention and digital output in animation workflows.  					AI-generated summary 				 Sketching provides an intuitive way to convey dynamic intent in animation authoring (i.e., how elements change over time and space), making it a natural medium for automatic content creation. Yet existing approaches often constrain sketches to fixed command tokens or predefined visual forms, overlooking their freeform nature and the central role of humans in shaping intention. To address this, we introduce an interaction paradigm where users convey dynamic intent to a vision-language model via free-form sketching, instantiated here in a sketch storyboard to motion graphics workflow. We implement an interface and improve it through a three-stage study with 24 participants. The study shows how sketches convey motion with minimal input, how their inherent ambiguity requires users to be involved for clarification, and how sketches can visually guide video refinement. Our findings reveal the potential of sketch and AI interaction to bridge the gap between intention and outcome, and demonstrate its applicability to 3D animation and video generation."

OmegaUse is a general-purpose GUI agent model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on mobile and desktop platforms through a combination of high-quality data construction, decoupled training methods, and a Mixture-of-Experts architecture.  					AI-generated summary 				 Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show great potential for enabling foundation models to complete real-world tasks, revolutionizing human-computer interaction and improving human productivity. In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl. OmegaUse also performs strongly on OS-Nav, reaching 74.24% step success on ChiM-Nav and 55.9% average success on Ubu-Nav.

SE-DiCoW improves speaker-attributed ASR performance by using diarization output to identify enrollment segments for fixed conditioning in cross-attention layers, achieving significant reductions in transcription error rates.  					AI-generated summary 				 Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (ASR) in multi-speaker environments remains a major challenge. While some approaches achieve strong performance when fine-tuned on specific domains, few systems generalize well across out-of-domain datasets. Our prior work, Diarization-Conditioned Whisper (DiCoW), leverages speaker diarization outputs as conditioning information and, with minimal fine-tuning, demonstrated strong multilingual and multi-domain performance. In this paper, we address a key limitation of DiCoW: ambiguity in Silence-Target-Non-target-Overlap (STNO) masks, where two or more fully overlapping speakers may have nearly identical conditioning despite differing transcriptions. We introduce SE-DiCoW (Self-Enrolled Diarization-Conditioned Whisper), which uses diarization output to locate an enrollment segment anywhere in the conversation where the target speaker is most active. This enrollment segment is used as fixed conditioning via cross-attention at each encoder layer. We further refine DiCoW with improved data segmentation, model initialization, and augmentation. Together, these advances yield substantial gains: SE-DiCoW reduces macro-averaged tcpWER by 52.4% relative to the original DiCoW on the EMMA MT-ASR benchmark.
