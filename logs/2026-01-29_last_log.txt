Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning enables on-policy learning from demonstrations, reducing catastrophic forgetting and allowing continuous skill accumulation in foundation models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Continual learning, enabling models to acquire new skills and knowledge without degrading existing capabilities, remains a fundamental challenge for foundation models. While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the primary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is inherently off-policy. We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that enables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In sequential learning experiments, SDFT enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without performance regression, establishing on-policy distillation as a practical path to continual learning from demonstrations.

В отличие от традиционного supervised fine-tuning, который работает off-policy и приводит к катастрофическому забыванию, SDFT использует модель с conditioning на демонстрации в качестве собственного учителя для генерации на-policy сигналов обучения. Метод показывает превосходство над SFT как в изучении новых навыков, так и в приобретении знаний, значительно снижая деградацию старых возможностей. SDFT позволяет модели последовательно накапливать несколько навыков без потери качества на предыдущих задачах, открывая новый путь к непрерывному обучению из демонстраций.",
