Index TermsVision-Language-Action Model, Artificial Intelligence, Embodied Intelligence, Robotics, Foundation modelsThe quest for general-purpose robots that can operate in real-world human environments is central goal of artificial intelligence. In recent years, new approach has emerged as one of the most promising paths toward this goal: VisionLanguage-Action (VLA) models. By connecting vision, language, and physical action, these models have catalyzed rapid progress, making the field of embodied intelligence both exciting and increasingly complex. To help navigate this rapidly growing landscape, numerous survey papers have recently emerged, covering the field from various perspectives. On the one hand, several works provide focused, in-depth reviews on specific technical subareas, such as action tokenization [1], efficient training paradigms [2], and post-training methodologies [3], offering granular insights into individual system components. On the other hand, broader surveys [4][9] offer comprehensive system overviews. These works typically serve as structured taxonomies, organizing the VLA landscape by model architectures, input modalities, or training objectives, providing readers with systematic list of the core components.

Fig. 1: The structure of this survey in pyramid format. Section 2 lays the foundational knowledge by deconstructing the core components of any VLA model. Building upon this, the second stage, Section 3, traces the historical evolution of the field through its most representative works, providing context and intuition. The deepest stage, Section 4, serves as the intellectual core, offering an in-depth analysis of the grand open problems and outlining actionable future research directions. The final section depicts the various applications, which are included in Appendix A.1. 5 2 0 2 9 ] . [ 3 2 6 3 1 1 . 2 1 5 2 : r PREPRINT SUBMITTED TO IEEE TPAMI 2 However, we identify two key gaps that this survey aims to address. First, existing surveys often relegate research challenges to concluding sectiona high-level overview appended at the end of the paper. The field still lacks unified resource that places these challenges at its core, systematically breaking them down, comparing alternative solution paths, and charting clear directions for future work. For researchers aiming to make novel contributions, mere list of problems is insufficient; what is needed is deep, structured analysis of the problem space. Second, the structure of most surveys does not align how researchers learn new field. Most existing works simply list and group methods by categorylike grouping visual-based approaches in one chapter and control strategies in another. While this facilitates quick reference, it presents fragmented view of the field. It provides extensive information but fails to illustrate how these pieces integrate into coherent, evolving research timeline. Consequently, such surveys do not guide newcomers from foundational concepts to recent breakthroughs along clear, progressive learning trajectory. This survey makes two core contributions to address these gaps. Our primary contribution is deep and systematic analysis of the core challenges in VLA research. Rather than appearing as brief concluding section, our challenge analysis forms the central pillar of this survey. We identify five key challenges following the developmental roadmap of VLA: (1) Multi-Modal Alignment and Physical World Modeling, (2) Instruction Following, Planning, and Robust Real-Time Execution, (3) From Generalization to Continuous Adaptation, (4) Safety, Interpretability, and Reliable Interaction, (5) Data Construction and Benchmarking Standards. For each, we provide an in-depth review of competing solutions and outline concrete avenues for future research. Our goal is twofold: to help researc"

This survey provides a structured overview of Vision-Language-Action models, detailing key challenges and opportunities in areas such as representation, execution, generalization, safety, and datasets in the field of robotics.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are driving a revolution in robotics, enabling machines to understand instructions and interact with the physical world. This field is exploding with new models and datasets, making it both exciting and challenging to keep pace with. This survey offers a clear and structured guide to the VLA landscape. We design it to follow the natural learning path of a researcher: we start with the basic Modules of any VLA model, trace the history through key Milestones, and then dive deep into the core Challenges that define recent research frontier. Our main contribution is a detailed breakdown of the five biggest challenges in: (1) Representation, (2) Execution, (3) Generalization, (4) Safety, and (5) Dataset and Evaluation. This structure mirrors the developmental roadmap of a generalist agent: establishing the fundamental perception-action loop, scaling capabilities across diverse embodiments and environments, and finally ensuring trustworthy deployment-all supported by the essential data infrastructure. For each of them, we review existing approaches and highlight future opportunities. We position this paper as both a foundational guide for newcomers and a strategic roadmap for experienced researchers, with the dual aim of accelerating learning and inspiring new ideas in embodied intelligence. A live version of this survey, with continuous updates, is maintained on our https://suyuz1.github.io/Survery/{project page}.
