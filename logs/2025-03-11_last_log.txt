Text:"This Is Your Doge, If It Please You: Exploring Deception and Robustness in Mixture of LLMs Lorenz Wolf 1 Sangwoong Yoon 1 Ilija BogunovicMixture of large language model (LLMs) Agents (MoA) architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance on prominent benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2.0 by leveraging the collaboration of multiple LLMs at inference time. Despite these successes, an evaluation of the safety and reliability of MoA is missing. We present the first comprehensive study of MoAs robustness against deceptive LLM agents that deliberately provide misleading responses. We examine factors like the propagation of deceptive information, model size, and information availability, and uncover critical vulnerabilities. On AlpacaEval 2.0, the popular LLaMA 3.1-70B model achieves length-controlled Win Rate (LC WR) of 49.2% when coupled with 3-layer MoA (6 LLM agents). However, we demonstrate that introducing only single carefully-instructed deceptive agent into the MoA can reduce performance to 37.9%, effectively nullifying all MoA gains. On QuALITY, multiple-choice comprehension task, the impact is also severe, with accuracy plummeting by staggering 48.5%. Inspired in part by the historical Doge of Venice voting process, designed to minimize influence and deception, we propose range of unsupervised defense mechanisms that recover most of the lost performance. 5 2 0 2 7 ] .

Over the 1,100 years of its existence (6971797), the Republic elected 121 men to lifetime terms as its leader, but the process was far from straightforward. Candidates were selected through labyrinthine system (see Figure 1) of five random drawings interspersed with 1University College London Center for Artificial IntelLorenz Wolf ligence, London, UK. Correspondence to: <lorenz.wolf.22@ucl.ac.uk>. Figure 1. Protocol for the election of Doge of Venice in 1730, print, Italy, 18th century. Thirty electors are selected by lot, narrowed to nine through second lottery. The process alternates between voting and random downsampling/upsampling until 41 electors remain to choose the doge.1 four secret voting sessions process that could stretch on for months. This intricate mechanism was not merely reflection of Venetian love for ceremony but calculated effort to curb tyranny and nepotism, ensuring no single family or faction could consolidate power. The influence of the citys most powerful families loomed large, but the electoral process served as delicate counterbalance to their ambitions. This fascinating system underscores how, even in complex web of alliances and rivalries, careful design can often foster stability and fairness. Nowadays, we are entering an era characterized by multi-agent large language models (LLMs), where AI agents can communicate and collaborate to solve tasks. These powerful AI agents promise immense potential for cooperation, but they also raise critical concerns: What if some agents act deceptively, pursue hidden agendas, or become corrupted by malicious intent or flawed objectives? In tightly interconnected system, the failure or manipulation of even single agent could jeopardize the broader systems outcomes, much like unchecked power could destabilize the Venetian Republic. 2. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become pervasive presence in everyday life, with AI assistants increas1For more details, visit https://www.theballotboy. com/electing-the-doge. 1 Exploring Deception and Robustness in Mixture of LLMs Figure 2. The 3-3-1 Mixture of Agents (MoA) architecture and the deceptive agents within. Agents in the first layer provide reference to the agents in the next layer, which generates new set of references based on them. The aggregator synthesizes the final response. Two deceptive agents are illustrated. Figure 3. The impact of single deceptive agent (1 out of 7) in MoA. On both datasets, single deceptive agent causes the performance metrics to plummet, erasing almost all the gains from having MoA (see Section 5, Figures 4 & 8). ingly consulted by users for wide variety of tasks (OpenAI et al., 2024a; Team et al., 2023; Dam et al., 2024). Thus far, scaling compute and model size have proven to be successful recipe for developing more powerful LLMs. Recently, the focus has shifted from scaling pre-training and model size to scaling compute at inference time, for example, allowing models to evaluate several answers and improve their response several times (Yao et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2025; OpenAI et al., 2024b; Snell et al., 2024). Instead of spending more resources on single model, architectures relying on multiple LLMs have proven successful. In particular, Wang et al. (2024) propose Mixture of Agents (MoA), hierarchical multi-LLM-agent system consisting of so-called proposers and aggregators. This allows for the integration of diverse perspectives from different agents, refining and enhancing the quality of the response. By combining responses from range of versatile LLMs and iteratively improving upon the initial outputs, MoA outperforms larger single LLMs such as GPT4-omni, achieving superior performance at lower inference cost. This advancement improves the cost-performance Pareto frontier, making the deployment of multi-agent systems both more efficient and effective in real-world applications. In fact, at the time of writing, 4 of the top 10 entries in the AlpacaEval 2.0 community leaderboard are based on Mixture of Agents architectures (Ye et al., 2024; Corbitt & Gandhi, 2024). As MoAs success is driven by diversity among the individual agents, one of its key features is its flexibility allowing for decentralized deployment. However, the decentralized nature of MoA creates room for vulnerabilities. Crucially, Wang et al. (2024) and other similar architectures rely on the assumption that all proposers act in good faith. Despite the study of misbehavior of individual LLMs having revealed severe issues (Hou et al., 2024; Scheurer et al., 2024; Hubinger et al., 2024a; Park et al., 2023), this assumption has not been challenged. In this work, we study the robustness of MoA in presence of deceptive agents that deliberately provide misleading responses (Figure 2), aiming to fill this gap in the literature. Evaluating MoA on the prominent question answering benchmark AlpacaEval 2.0 (Li et al., 2023c), and the multiple-choice passage comprehension task QuALITY (Pa"

Mixture of <PRE_TAG>large language model (LLMs) Agents (MoA)</POST_TAG> architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance on prominent benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2.0 by leveraging the collaboration of multiple LLMs at inference time. Despite these successes, an evaluation of the safety and reliability of MoA is missing. We present the first comprehensive study of MoA's robustness against deceptive LLM agents that deliberately provide misleading responses. We examine factors like the propagation of deceptive information, model size, and information availability, and uncover critical vulnerabilities. On AlpacaEval 2.0, the popular LLaMA 3.1-70B model achieves a length-controlled Win Rate (LC WR) of 49.2% when coupled with 3-layer MoA (6 LLM agents). However, we demonstrate that introducing only a single carefully-instructed deceptive agent into the MoA can reduce performance to 37.9%, effectively nullifying all MoA gains. On QuALITY, a multiple-choice comprehension task, the impact is also severe, with accuracy plummeting by a staggering 48.5%. Inspired in part by the historical Doge of Venice voting process, designed to minimize influence and deception, we propose a range of unsupervised defense mechanisms that recover most of the lost performance.

"Mixture of <PRE_TAG>large language model (LLMs) Agents (MoA)</POST_TAG> architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance on prominent benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2.0 by leveraging the collaboration of multiple LLMs at inference time. Despite these successes, an evaluation of the safety and reliability of MoA is missing. We present the first comprehensive study of MoA's robustness against deceptive LLM agents that deliberately provide misleading responses. We examine factors like the propagation of deceptive information, model size, and information availability, and uncover critical vulnerabilities. On AlpacaEval 2.0, the popular LLaMA 3.1-70B model achieves a length-controlled Win Rate (LC WR) of 49.2% when coupled with 3-layer MoA (6 LLM agents). However, we demonstrate that introducing only a single carefully-instructed deceptive agent into the MoA can reduce performance to 37.9%, effectively nullifying all MoA gains. On QuALITY, a multiple-choice comprehension task, the impact is also severe, with accuracy plummeting by a staggering 48.5%. Inspired in part by the historical Doge of Venice voting process, designed to minimize influence and deception, we propose a range of unsupervised defense mechanisms that recover most of the lost performance."

While classifier-free guidance (CFG) is essential for conditional diffusion models, it doubles the number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) per inference step. To mitigate this inefficiency, we introduce adapter guidance distillation (AGD), a novel approach that simulates CFG in a single forward pass. AGD leverages lightweight adapters to approximate CFG, effectively doubling the sampling speed while maintaining or even improving sample quality. Unlike prior guidance distillation methods that tune the entire model, AGD keeps the base model frozen and only trains minimal additional parameters (sim2%) to significantly reduce the resource requirement of the distillation phase. Additionally, this approach preserves the original model weights and enables the adapters to be seamlessly combined with other checkpoints derived from the same base model. We also address a key mismatch between training and inference in existing guidance distillation methods by training on CFG-guided trajectories instead of standard diffusion trajectories. Through extensive experiments, we show that AGD achieves comparable or superior FID to CFG across multiple architectures with only half the NFEs. Notably, our method enables the distillation of large models (sim2.6B parameters) on a single consumer GPU with 24 GB of VRAM, making it more accessible than previous approaches that require multiple high-end GPUs. We will publicly release the implementation of our method.
