INTRODUCTION Vision based 6-DoF grasping in robotics remains significant challenge due to the wide diversity of object shapes, textures, and material properties in real-world environments [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Accurate reconstruction of 3D scene geometry is essential for determining feasible grasps. However, this task is often compromised by limitations of depth sensors which produce unreliable depth measurements when confronted with transparent and specular objects. Such limitations result in degraded geometric representations of the scene and, consequently, unsuccessful grasps. Recent research has explored the use of neural radiance field (NeRF) [7] to address the challenge of grasping transparent and specular objects due to its ability to effectively capture complex light interactions on non-Lambertian surfaces. DexNeRF [8] pioneers this approach but it suffers from the need for dense input images and extensive per-grasp training, making it impractical for real-world applications. GraspNeRF [9] uses generalizable NeRF that requires only sparse views and eliminates the need for per-scene optimization. However, it still relies on comprehensive 360-degree image capture and ground-truth Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) supervision, which may not always be 1State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. 2School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. 3Qiyuan Lab. *This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62273342, 62473366 and U23B2038, and in part by the Qiyuan Lab Innovation Fund Project (2022-JCJQ-LA001-024). Corresponding to yinghao.cai@ia.ac.cn. Fig. 1. Overview of NeuGrasp. We introduce generalizable method that utilizes background priors within neural implicit surface framework to achieve real-time scene reconstruction and material-agnostic grasping from observations within narrow field of view. feasible in real-world scenarios. RGBGrasp [10] further improves upon this by integrating an all-in-one NeRF extension from [11] with pre-trained models for depth estimation and grasp detection, achieving robust performance with RGBonly inputs. However, it still relies on dense views and lacks generalizability, requiring time-consuming retraining for each grasp, which limits its use for real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce NeuGrasp for the 6-DoF robotic grasping tasks  (Fig. 1)  . NeuGrasp is generalizable method that efficiently utilizes background priors to reconstruct scene geometry and generate diverse grasp candidates from observations within narrow field of view, all in real time and without the need for depth-related supervision. By employing Transformer architecture within neural implicit reconstruction framework, NeuGrasp combines multi-view features enriched with spatial encoding to infer scene geometry, thereby facilitating surface reconstruction in novel grasping scenarios. Additionally, the integration of highlevel global prior volume allows NeuGrasp to perform effectively even under narrow fields of view and sparse viewing conditions. key aspect of our approach is the use of background priors for surface reconstruction with transparent and specular objects. We propose residual feature enhancement module which enhances the models attention on foreground objects by contrasting features from scene and background images. Additionally, we introduce an occupancy-prior volume that utilizes global implicit occupancy information from residual feature maps to enhance spatial perception, especially for transparent and specular objects. Experimental results show that NeuGrasp significantly outperforms baselines especially in scenarios that involve only transparent and specular objects. The performance of surface reconstruction of NeuGrasp is on par with the methods that use explicit geometry supervision. With finetuning on small real-world dataset, NeuGrasp-RA (Reality Augmentation) further improves the performance of robotic grasping which demonstrates the potential of our approach to be applied in real applications. In summary, our contributions are: We integrate view transformer, ray transformer, and global prior volume to hierarchically aggregate multiview features and spatial priors, providing an effective solution for generalizable implicit surface reconstruction under narrow and sparse view conditions. Both surface reconstruction and grasp detection are trained in an end-to-end manner. We propose to leverage scene background priors for surface reconstruction in scenes with transparent and specular objects. Through residual feature enhancement, these objects can be clearly distinguished from the background, facilitating more accurate grasp detection. We demonstrate the superiority of our method in both simulated and real-world experiments for the tasks of reconstruction and grasp detection. NeuGrasp significantly outperforms baselines in grasping particularly in scenarios with transparent and specular objects. II. RELATED WORK A.

Implementing new features in repository-level codebases is a crucial application of code generation models. However, current benchmarks lack a dedicated evaluation framework for this capability. To fill this gap, we introduce FEA-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform incremental development within code repositories. We collect pull requests from 83 GitHub repositories and use rule-based and intent-based filtering to construct task instances focused on new feature development. Each task instance containing code changes is paired with relevant unit test files to ensure that the solution can be verified. The feature implementation requires LLMs to simultaneously possess code completion capabilities for new components and code editing abilities for other relevant parts in the code repository, providing a more comprehensive evaluation method of LLMs' automated software engineering capabilities. Experimental results show that LLMs perform significantly worse in the FEA-Bench, highlighting considerable challenges in such repository-level incremental code development.

"Implementing new features in repository-level codebases is a crucial application of code generation models. However, current benchmarks lack a dedicated evaluation framework for this capability. To fill this gap, we introduce FEA-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform incremental development within code repositories. We collect pull requests from 83 GitHub repositories and use rule-based and intent-based filtering to construct task instances focused on new feature development. Each task instance containing code changes is paired with relevant unit test files to ensure that the solution can be verified. The feature implementation requires LLMs to simultaneously possess code completion capabilities for new components and code editing abilities for other relevant parts in the code repository, providing a more comprehensive evaluation method of LLMs' automated software engineering capabilities. Experimental results show that LLMs perform significantly worse in the FEA-Bench, highlighting considerable challenges in such repository-level incremental code development."

Recent advancements in Unet-based diffusion models, such as ControlNet and IP-Adapter, have introduced effective spatial and subject control mechanisms. However, the DiT (Diffusion Transformer) architecture still struggles with efficient and flexible control. To tackle this issue, we propose EasyControl, a novel framework designed to unify condition-guided diffusion transformers with high efficiency and flexibility. Our framework is built on three key innovations. First, we introduce a lightweight <PRE_TAG>Condition Injection LoRA Module</POST_TAG>. This module processes conditional signals in isolation, acting as a plug-and-play solution. It avoids modifying the base model weights, ensuring compatibility with customized models and enabling the flexible injection of diverse conditions. Notably, this module also supports harmonious and robust zero-shot multi-condition generalization, even when trained only on single-condition data. Second, we propose a <PRE_TAG>Position-Aware Training Paradigm</POST_TAG>. This approach standardizes input conditions to fixed resolutions, allowing the generation of images with arbitrary aspect ratios and flexible resolutions. At the same time, it optimizes computational efficiency, making the framework more practical for real-world applications. Third, we develop a Causal Attention Mechanism combined with the KV Cache technique, adapted for conditional generation tasks. This innovation significantly reduces the latency of image synthesis, improving the overall efficiency of the framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that EasyControl achieves exceptional performance across various application scenarios. These innovations collectively make our framework highly efficient, flexible, and suitable for a wide range of tasks.

We present MM-Eureka, a multimodal reasoning model that successfully extends large-scale rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal reasoning. While rule-based RL has shown remarkable success in improving LLMs' reasoning abilities in text domains, its application to multimodal settings has remained challenging. Our work reproduces key characteristics of text-based RL systems like DeepSeek-R1 in the multimodal space, including steady increases in accuracy reward and response length, and the emergence of reflection behaviors. We demonstrate that both instruction-tuned and pre-trained models can develop strong multimodal reasoning capabilities through rule-based RL without supervised fine-tuning, showing superior data efficiency compared to alternative approaches. We open-source our complete pipeline to foster further research in this area. We release all our codes, models, data, etc. at https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-EUREKA

Traditional methods for reasoning segmentation rely on supervised fine-tuning with categorical labels and simple descriptions, limiting its out-of-domain generalization and lacking explicit reasoning processes. To address these limitations, we propose Seg-Zero, a novel framework that demonstrates remarkable generalizability and derives explicit chain-of-thought reasoning through cognitive reinforcement. Seg-Zero introduces a decoupled architecture consisting of a reasoning model and a segmentation model. The reasoning model interprets user intentions, generates explicit reasoning chains, and produces positional prompts, which are subsequently used by the segmentation model to generate precious pixel-level masks. We design a sophisticated reward mechanism that integrates both format and accuracy rewards to effectively guide optimization directions. Trained exclusively via reinforcement learning with GRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Seg-Zero achieves robust zero-shot generalization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning capabilities. Experiments show that Seg-Zero-7B achieves a zero-shot performance of 57.5 on the ReasonSeg benchmark, surpassing the prior LISA-7B by 18\%. This significant improvement highlights Seg-Zero's ability to generalize across domains while presenting an explicit reasoning process.

"Traditional methods for reasoning segmentation rely on supervised fine-tuning with categorical labels and simple descriptions, limiting its out-of-domain generalization and lacking explicit reasoning processes. To address these limitations, we propose Seg-Zero, a novel framework that demonstrates remarkable generalizability and derives explicit chain-of-thought reasoning through cognitive reinforcement. Seg-Zero introduces a decoupled architecture consisting of a reasoning model and a segmentation model. The reasoning model interprets user intentions, generates explicit reasoning chains, and produces positional prompts, which are subsequently used by the segmentation model to generate precious pixel-level masks. We design a sophisticated reward mechanism that integrates both format and accuracy rewards to effectively guide optimization directions. Trained exclusively via reinforcement learning with GRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Seg-Zero achieves robust zero-shot generalization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning capabilities. Experiments show that Seg-Zero-7B achieves a zero-shot performance of 57.5 on the ReasonSeg benchmark, surpassing the prior LISA-7B by 18\%. This significant improvement highlights Seg-Zero's ability to generalize across domains while presenting an explicit reasoning process. Code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/Seg-Zero."

State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers, mitigating their quadratic computational cost. However, the application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods to SSMs remains largely unexplored. In particular, prompt-based methods like Prompt Tuning and Prefix-Tuning, which are widely used in Transformers, do not perform well on SSMs. To address this, we propose state-based methods as a superior alternative to prompt-based methods. This new family of methods naturally stems from the architectural characteristics of SSMs. State-based methods adjust state-related features directly instead of depending on external prompts. Furthermore, we introduce a novel state-based PEFT method: State-offset Tuning. At every timestep, our method directly affects the state at the current step, leading to more effective adaptation. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/ssm-state-tuning.

Robotic grasping in scenes with transparent and specular objects presents great challenges for methods relying on accurate depth information. In this paper, we introduce NeuGrasp, a neural surface reconstruction method that leverages background priors for material-agnostic grasp detection. NeuGrasp integrates transformers and global prior volumes to aggregate multi-view features with spatial encoding, enabling robust surface reconstruction in narrow and sparse viewing conditions. By focusing on foreground objects through residual feature enhancement and refining spatial perception with an occupancy-prior volume, NeuGrasp excels in handling objects with transparent and specular surfaces. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world scenarios show that NeuGrasp outperforms state-of-the-art methods in grasping while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality. More details are available at https://neugrasp.github.io/.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in integrating visual and textual information for vision-centric tasks, but their handling of inconsistencies between modalities is underexplored. We investigate VLMs' modality preferences when faced with visual data and varied textual inputs in vision-centered settings. By introducing textual variations to four vision-centric tasks and evaluating ten Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we discover a ``blind faith in text'' phenomenon: VLMs disproportionately trust textual data over visual data when inconsistencies arise, leading to significant performance drops under corrupted text and raising safety concerns. We analyze factors influencing this text bias, including instruction prompts, language model size, text relevance, token order, and the interplay between visual and textual certainty. While certain factors, such as scaling up the language model size, slightly mitigate text bias, others like token order can exacerbate it due to positional biases inherited from language models. To address this issue, we explore supervised fine-tuning with text augmentation and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing text bias. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis suggesting that the blind faith in text phenomenon may stem from an imbalance of pure text and multi-modal data during training. Our findings highlight the need for balanced training and careful consideration of modality interactions in VLMs to enhance their robustness and reliability in handling multi-modal data inconsistencies.

Our findings highlight the need for balanced training and careful consideration of modality interactions in VLMs to enhance their robustness and reliability in handling multi-modal data inconsistencies."
