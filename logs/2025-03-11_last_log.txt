[ 1 9 1 8 2 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r aWhile score-based generative models are the model of choice across diverse domains, there are limited tools available for controlling inferencetime behavior in principled manner, e.g. for composing multiple pretrained models. Existing classifier-free guidance methods use simple heuristic to mix conditional and unconditional scores to approximately sample from conditional distributions. However, such methods do not approximate the intermediate distributions, necessitating additional corrector steps. In this work, we provide an efficient and principled method for sampling from sequence of annealed, geometric-averaged, or product distributions derived from pretrained score-based models. We derive weighted simulation scheme which we call FEYNMAN-KAC CORRECTORS (FKCs) based on the celebrated Feynman-Kac formula by carefully accounting for terms in the appropriate partial differential equations (PDEs). To simulate these PDEs, we propose Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) resampling algorithms that leverage inference-time scaling to improve sampling quality. We empirically demonstrate the utility of our methods by proposing amortized sampling via inference-time temperature annealing, improving multi-objective molecule generation using pretrained models, and improving classifierfree guidance for text-to-image generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/ martaskrt/fkc-diffusion. 1. Introduction Score-based generative models, also known as diffusion models, have emerged as the model of choice across diverse generative tasks such as image generation, natural language, *Equal contribution 1University of Toronto 2Vector Institute 3McGill University 4Mila - Quebec AI Institute 5Imperial College London 6Google DeepMind 7Université de Montréal. Correspondence to: Kirill Neklyudov <k.necludov@gmail.com>. 1 Figure 1. FEYNMAN-KAC CORRECTOR Inference for annealed pt,β(x) qt(x)β=10 and product pt(x) q1 (x) densities. (x)q2 and protein simulation (Saharia et al., 2022; Sahoo et al., 2024; Abramson et al., 2024). These models leverage the ability to estimate scores of the sequence of noise-corrupted distributions and then use the learned scores to reverse the corruption process enabling high-quality generation. Thus, diffusion models aim to produce new samples from the same distribution as the training data. However, the classical paradigm of generative modeling as the problem of reproducing the training data distribution becomes less relevant for many applications including drug discovery and text-to-image generation. In practice, generative models demonstrate the best performance when tailored to specific needs at inference time. For instance, linear combinations of scores allow for concept composition (Liu et al., 2022) or for increasing image-prompt consistency as in classifier-free guidance (CFG) (Ho & Salimans, 2021). However, by modifying the scores, one loses control over the marginal distributions of the generated samples. Various approaches from the Monte Carlo sampling literature have been adapted to correct samples along trajectory to more closely match the prescribed intermediate distributions. Assuming access to an exact score, additional Langevin corrector steps with the desired invariant distribution can be applied with additional simulation steps as the only Feynman-Kac Correctors in Diffusion: Annealing, Guidance, and Product of Experts practical overhead (Song et al., 2021; Bradley & Nakkiran, 2024). However, these corrector schemes are only exact in the limit of infinite intermediate steps. Accept-reject or Sequential Monte Carlo techniques may be used when the score is parameterized through scalar energy function (Du et al., 2023; Phillips et al., 2024), although these parameterizations require extra computation during training and may sacrifice expressivity in practice (Salimans & Ho, 2021; Thornton et al., 2025). While methods for sampling from mixtures or equiprobable regions of diffusion models have been proposed (Skreta et al., 2024), general solutions to accurately sample from combinations or temperings of flexibly-parameterized diffusion models with limited computational overhead remain elusive. To address these challenges, we introduce FEYNMAN-KAC CORRECTOR (FKCs), which enable efficient and principled sampling from sequence of annealed, geometric-averaged, or product distributions derived from pretrained diffusion models. To develop FEYNMAN-KAC CORRECTORS and test their efficacy, we make the following contributions: We propose flexible recipe for constructing weighted stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which account for additional terms appearing when manipulating the distribution of generated samples. As our primary examples, we derive the correction terms for multiple heuristic schemes commonly used to approximate annealed, product, or geometric averaged distributions, including CFG (Sec. 3). To simulate these weighted SDEs, we propose family of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) resampling schemes, which correct batch of simulated samples to closely approximate the intermediate target distributions (Sec. 4). For the problem of sampling from an unnormalized density, we demonstrate that FKC allows for sampling from variety of temperatures without retraining (Sec. 5.2). Moreover, we demonstrate that high-temperature learning, low-temperature inference scheme can be more efficient than the notoriously difficult task of directly training sampler at lower temperature. For pretrained diffusion models we demonstrate that adding FKC terms enhances compositional generation of molecules with multiple properties (Sec. 5.3) and classifier-free guidance for image generation (Sec. 5.1). 2. Background 2.1. Diffusion Models Generative modeling via diffusion models can be formulated as the simulation of the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) corresponding to the reverse-time process. In particular, during training, one gradually destroys samples from the data-distribution pdata(x) by simulating the following noising SDE: dxτ = fτ (xτ )dτ + στ dW τ , xτ =0 pdata(x) , (1) where fτ (xτ ) is usually some linear drift function fτ (xτ ) = ατ xτ , στ defines the scale of noise throug"

While score-based generative models are the model of choice across diverse domains, there are limited tools available for controlling inference-time behavior in a principled manner, e.g. for composing multiple pretrained models. Existing classifier-free guidance methods use a simple heuristic to mix conditional and un<PRE_TAG>conditional scores</POST_TAG> to approximately sample from conditional distributions. However, such methods do not approximate the intermediate distributions, necessitating additional 'corrector' steps. In this work, we provide an efficient and principled method for sampling from a sequence of annealed, geometric-averaged, or product distributions derived from pretrained score-based models. We derive a weighted simulation scheme which we call Feynman-Kac Correctors (FKCs) based on the celebrated Feynman-Kac formula by carefully accounting for terms in the appropriate partial differential equations (PDEs). To simulate these PDEs, we propose Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) resampling algorithms that leverage inference-time scaling to improve sampling quality. We empirically demonstrate the utility of our methods by proposing amortized sampling via inference-time temperature annealing, improving multi-objective molecule generation using pretrained models, and improving classifier-free guidance for text-to-image generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/martaskrt/fkc-diffusion.

Existing classifier-free guidance methods use a simple heuristic to mix conditional and un<PRE_TAG>conditional scores</POST_TAG> to approximately sample from conditional distributions. However, such methods do not approximate the intermediate distributions, necessitating additional 'corrector' steps. In this work, we provide an efficient and principled method for sampling from a sequence of annealed, geometric-averaged, or product distributions derived from pretrained score-based models. We derive a weighted simulation scheme which we call Feynman-Kac Correctors (FKCs) based on the celebrated Feynman-Kac formula by carefully accounting for terms in the appropriate partial differential equations (PDEs). To simulate these PDEs, we propose Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) resampling algorithms that leverage inference-time scaling to improve sampling quality. We empirically demonstrate the utility of our methods by proposing amortized sampling via inference-time temperature annealing, improving multi-objective molecule generation using pretrained models, and improving classifier-free guidance for text-to-image generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/martaskrt/fkc-diffusion."
