[11.03.2025 05:11] Abstract 1. Existing long-form video generation frameworks lack automated planning, requiring manual input for storylines, scenes, cinematography, and character interactions, resulting in high costs and inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we present MovieAgent, an automated movie generation via multi-a...

[11.03.2025 05:11] Abstract 2. Federated Learning (FL) is a widely used framework for training models in a decentralized manner, ensuring that the central server does not have direct access to data from local clients. However, this approach may still fail to fully preserve data privacy, as models from local clients are exposed to...

[11.03.2025 05:11] Abstract 3. Despite the success of distillation in large language models (LLMs), most prior work applies identical loss functions to both teacher- and student-generated data. These strategies overlook the synergy between loss formulations and data types, leading to a suboptimal performance boost in student mode...

[11.03.2025 05:11] Abstract 4. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), built on large-scale pre-trained vision towers and language models, have shown great capabilities in multimodal understanding. However, most existing MLLMs are trained on single-turn vision question-answering tasks, which do not accurately reflect real-world...

[11.03.2025 05:11] Abstract 5. Implementing new features in repository-level codebases is a crucial application of code generation models. However, current benchmarks lack a dedicated evaluation framework for this capability. To fill this gap, we introduce FEA-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of large language mo...

[11.03.2025 05:11] Abstract 6. Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success across various natural language processing tasks, yet their high computational cost during inference remains a major bottleneck. This paper introduces Sparse Expert Activation Pruning (SEAP), a training-free pruning method that selectively retai...

[11.03.2025 05:11] Abstract 7. Recent advancements in Unet-based diffusion models, such as ControlNet and IP-Adapter, have introduced effective spatial and subject control mechanisms. However, the DiT (Diffusion Transformer) architecture still struggles with efficient and flexible control. To tackle this issue, we propose EasyCon...

[11.03.2025 05:11] Abstract 8. Universal multimodal embedding models play a critical role in tasks such as interleaved image-text retrieval, multimodal RAG, and multimodal clustering. However, our empirical results indicate that existing LMM-based embedding models trained with the standard InfoNCE loss exhibit a high degree of ov...

[11.03.2025 05:11] Abstract 9. Traditional agentic workflows rely on external prompts to manage interactions with tools and the environment, which limits the autonomy of reasoning models. We position Large Agent Models (LAMs) that internalize the generation of Chain-of-Action (CoA), enabling the model to autonomously decide when ...

[11.03.2025 05:11] Abstract 10. OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 achieve or even surpass human expert-level performance in complex domains like mathematics and science, with reinforcement learning (RL) and reasoning playing a crucial role. In autonomous driving, recent end-to-end models have greatly improved planning performance but stil...

[11.03.2025 05:11] Abstract 13. Traditional methods for reasoning segmentation rely on supervised fine-tuning with categorical labels and simple descriptions, limiting its out-of-domain generalization and lacking explicit reasoning processes. To address these limitations, we propose Seg-Zero, a novel framework that demonstrates re...

Pre-trained LLMs that are further trained with image data perform well on vision-language tasks. While adding images during a second training phase effectively unlocks this capability, it is unclear how much of a gain or loss this two-step pipeline gives over VLMs which integrate images earlier into the training process. To investigate this, we train models spanning various datasets, scales, image-text ratios, and amount of pre-training done before introducing vision tokens. We then fine-tune these models and evaluate their downstream performance on a suite of vision-language and text-only tasks. We find that pre-training with a mixture of image and text data allows models to perform better on vision-language tasks while maintaining strong performance on text-only evaluations. On an average of 6 diverse tasks, we find that for a 1B model, introducing visual tokens 80% of the way through pre-training results in a 2% average improvement over introducing visual tokens to a fully pre-trained model.

Solving expert-level multimodal tasks is a key milestone towards general intelligence. As the capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) continue to improve, evaluation of such advanced multimodal intelligence becomes necessary yet challenging. In this work, we introduce ProBench, a benchmark of open-ended user queries that require professional expertise and advanced reasoning. ProBench consists of 4,000 high-quality samples independently submitted by professionals based on their daily productivity demands. It spans across 10 fields and 56 sub-fields, including science, arts, humanities, coding, mathematics, and creative writing. Experimentally, we evaluate and compare 24 latest models using MLLM-as-a-Judge. Our results reveal that although the best open-source models rival the proprietary ones, ProBench presents significant challenges in visual perception, textual understanding, domain knowledge and advanced reasoning, thus providing valuable directions for future multimodal AI research efforts.

Survey paper plays a crucial role in scientific research, especially given the rapid growth of research publications. Recently, researchers have begun using LLMs to automate survey generation for better efficiency. However, the quality gap between LLM-generated surveys and those written by human remains significant, particularly in terms of outline quality and citation accuracy. To close these gaps, we introduce SurveyForge, which first generates the outline by analyzing the logical structure of human-written outlines and referring to the retrieved domain-related articles. Subsequently, leveraging high-quality papers retrieved from memory by our scholar navigation agent, SurveyForge can automatically generate and refine the content of the generated article. Moreover, to achieve a comprehensive evaluation, we construct SurveyBench, which includes 100 human-written survey papers for win-rate comparison and assesses AI-generated survey papers across three dimensions: reference, outline, and content quality. Experiments demonstrate that SurveyForge can outperform previous works such as AutoSurvey.
