[11.03.2025 07:11] Abstract 22. Solving expert-level multimodal tasks is a key milestone towards general intelligence. As the capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) continue to improve, evaluation of such advanced multimodal intelligence becomes necessary yet challenging. In this work, we introduce ProBench, a be...

[11.03.2025 07:11] Abstract 23. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in integrating visual and textual information for vision-centric tasks, but their handling of inconsistencies between modalities is underexplored. We investigate VLMs' modality preferences when faced with visual data and varied textual inputs in vision-centered se...

[11.03.2025 07:11] Abstract 24. The increasing popularity of large language models has not only led to widespread use but has also brought various risks, including the potential for systematically spreading fake news. Consequently, the development of classification systems such as DetectGPT has become vital. These detectors are vu...

[11.03.2025 07:11] Abstract 25. Robotic grasping in scenes with transparent and specular objects presents great challenges for methods relying on accurate depth information. In this paper, we introduce NeuGrasp, a neural surface reconstruction method that leverages background priors for material-agnostic grasp detection. NeuGrasp ...
