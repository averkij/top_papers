Text:"FedRand: Enhancing Privacy in Federated Learning with Randomized LoRA Subparameter Updates Sangwoo Park 1 Seanie Lee 1 Byungjoo Kim 1 Sung Ju Hwang 1 2 5 2 0 2 0 1 ] . [ 1 6 1 2 7 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r Abstract Federated Learning (FL) is widely used framework for training models in decentralized manner, ensuring that the central server does not have direct access to data from local clients. However, this approach may still fail to fully preserve data privacy, as models from local clients are exposed to the central server during the aggregation process. This issue becomes even more critical when training vision-language models (VLMs) with FL, as VLMs can easily memorize training data instances, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs). To address this challenge, we propose the FedRand framework, which avoids disclosing the full set In this framework, each of client parameters. client randomly selects subparameters of LowRank Adaptation (LoRA) from the server and keeps the remaining counterparts of the LoRA weights as private parameters. After training both parameters on the clients private dataset, only the non-private client parameters are sent back to the server for aggregation. This approach mitigates the risk of exposing client-side VLM parameters, thereby enhancing data privacy. We empirically validate that FedRand improves robustness against MIAs compared to relevant baselines while achieving accuracy comparable to methods that communicate full LoRA parameters across several benchmark datasets. 1. Introduction Vision-language models (VLMs) (Alayrac et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various multi-modal tasks, such as visual question answering (Dai et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023) and image captioning (Li et al., 2023).

However, existing methods face critical challenges, including limited generalization across scenes, suboptimal perception accuracy, and slow reconstruction speeds. To address these limitations, we propose Perception-Efficient 3D Reconstruction (PE3R), novel framework designed to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. PE3R employs feedforward architecture to enable rapid 3D semantic field reconstruction. The framework demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization across diverse scenes and objects while significantly improving reconstruction speed. Extensive experiments on 2D-to-3D open-vocabulary segmentation and 3D reconstruction validate the effectiveness and versatility of PE3R. The framework 1xML Lab, National University of Singapore. achieves minimum 9-fold speedup in 3D semantic field reconstruction, along with substantial gains in perception accuracy and reconstruction precision, setting new benchmarks in the field. The code is publicly available at: https: //github.com/hujiecpp/PE3R. 1. Introduction Machine vision systems have made significant strides in 2D perception tasks, particularly with single-view images. However, humans perceive the world by integrating information from multiple viewpoints (Ayzenberg & Behrmann, 2024; Sinha & Poggio, 1996; Welchman et al., 2005). This raises fundamental question in machine learning: How can advanced 2D perception models be enhanced to achieve comprehensive understanding of 3D scenes without relying on explicit 3D information? Addressing this question has become pivotal research focus. Recent advancements in 2D-to-3D perception provide foundation for reconstructing and interpreting 3D scenes using 2D inputs (Goel et al., 2023; Kobayashi et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2023; Tschernezki et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2023; Takmaz et al., 2023; Kerr et al., 2023; Cen et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024; Qin et al., 2024; Cen et al., 2024). These methods enable models to reconstruct 3D environments from multiple 2D images captured from different viewpoints. Despite significant progress, existing approaches face key limitations, including poor generalization across diverse scenes, suboptimal perception accuracy, and slow reconstruction speeds. State-of-the-art methods, primarily based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) (Mildenhall et al., 2021) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) (Kerbl et al., 2023), achieve impressive reconstruction quality. However, their reliance on scene-specific training and semantic extraction introduces significant computational overhead, limiting scalability for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose PerceptionEfficient 3D Reconstruction (PE3R), novel framework designed for efficient and accurate 3D semantic reconstruction. Inspired by recent advancements in efficient 3D scene reconstruction (Wang et al., 2024; Leroy et al., 2024), PE3R employs feed-forward mechanism to enable rapid 3D semantic reconstruction. The framework incorporates three key modules to enhance perception and reconstruction capabilities: pixel embedding disambiguation, semantic field reconstruction, and global view perception. Pixel embedding disambiguation integrates cross-view, multi-level semantic information to resolve ambiguities across hierarchical objects and ensure viewpoint consistency. Semantic field reconstruction embeds semantic information directly into the reconstruction process, improving accuracy. Global view perception aligns global semantics, mitigating noise introduced by single-view perspectives. As illustrated in Figure 1, these innovations enable robust and efficient zero-shot generalization across diverse scenes and objects. We evaluate PE3R on tasks including 2D-to-3D openvocabulary segmentation and 3D reconstruction, using datasets such as Mipnerf360 (Barron et al., 2022), Replica (Straub et al., 2019), KITTI (Geiger et al., 2013), ScanNet (Dai et al., 2017), ScanNet++(Yeshwanth et al., 2023), ETH3D(Schops et al., 2017), DTU (Aanæs et al., 2016), and Tanks and Temples (Knapitsch et al., 2017). Our results demonstrate 9-fold improvement in reconstruction speed, and also the enhancement in segmentation accuracy as well as reconstruction precision, establishing new performance benchmarks. The contributions of this work are as follows: We propose PE3R, an efficient feed-forward framework for 2D-to-3D semantic reconstruction. We introduce three novel modules, pixel embedding disambiguation, semantic field reconstruction, and global view perception, that enable better reconstruction speed and accuracy. We validate PE3R through extensive experiments, demonstrating robust zero-shot generalization, improved performance metrics, and practical scalability. The code will be publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research. 2. Related Work 2D-to-3D Reconstruction. Recent advancements in 2D image-based 3D reconstruction have significantly improved surface reconstruction. Methods such as (Fu et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2023; Long et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021; 2022) employ signed distance functions (SDFs) to represent surfaces, combining them with advanced volume rendering techniques to achieve higher accuracy. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) (Mildenhall et al., 2021) have demonstrated exceptional performance in generating realistic novel viewpoints for view synthesis. Extending this, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) (Kerbl et al., 2023) introduces explicit 3D scene representations to reduce the computational complexity of NeRFs implicit reconstruction.

Keywords: Language Models, Language Model Detection, Transformer Reinforcement Learning, Paraphrasing Attack Abstract The increasing popularity of large language models has not only led to widespread use but has also brought various risks, including the potential for systematically spreading fake news. Consequently, the development of classification systems such as DetectGPT has become vital. These detectors are vulnerable to evasion techniques, as demonstrated in an experimental series: Systematic changes of the generative models temperature proofed shallow learning detectors to be the least reliable (Exp. 1). Fine-tuning the generative model via reinforcement learning circumvented BERT-baseddetectors (Exp. 2). Finally, rephrasing led to >90% evasion of zero-shotdetectors like DetectGPT, although texts stayed highly similar to the original (Exp. 3). comparison with existing work highlights the better performance of the presented methods. Possible implications for society and further research are discussed. Policy Significance Statement Large language models produce texts that appear indistinguishable from human ones, which is why research focuses on machine learning based detectors. This paper demonstrates how various stateof-the-art detectors can be tricked using different techniques. Specifically, text-generating models are modified in such way they a) no longer use the most likely words (parameter temperature), b) are penalized for certain conspicuous content (reinforcement learning), or c) rephrase sentences so slightly that they remain the same in terms of content but can no longer be recognized as machine-generated (paraphrasing). In short, detectors can easily be bypassed. The implications for society and r"

[ 1 7 9 1 7 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r Abstract Although masked image generation models and masked diffusion models are designed with different motivations and objectives, we observe that they can be unified within single framework. Building upon this insight, we carefully explore the design space of training and sampling, identifying key factors that contribute to both performance and efficiency. Based on the improvements observed during this exploration, we develop our model, referred to as eMIGM. Empirically, eMIGM demonstrates strong performance on ImageNet generation, as measured by Frechet Inception Distance (FID). In particular, on ImageNet 256256, with similar number of function evaluations (NFEs) and model parameters, eMIGM outperforms the seminal VAR. Moreover, as NFE and model parameters increase, eMIGM achieves performance comparable to the state-ofthe-art continuous diffusion models while requiring less than 40% of the NFE. Additionally, on ImageNet 512 512, with only about 60% of the NFE, eMIGM outperforms the state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models. 1. Introduction Masked modeling has proven effective across various domains, including self-supervised learning (He et al., 2022a; Bao et al., 2021; Devlin, 2018), image generation (Li et al., 2023; Chang et al., 2022; Li et al., 2024), and text generation (Sahoo et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024; Lou et al., 2024a). In image generation, MaskGIT (Chang et al., 2022) introduced masked image generation, offering efficiency and quality improvements over autoregressive models but still lagging behind diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020; SohlDickstein et al., 2015; Song et al., 2020) due to information loss from discrete tokenization (Esser et al., 2021; Van Work done during an internship at Ant Group Project leaders 1Gaoling School of AI, Renmin University of China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Big Data Management and Analysis Method"

[ 1 1 2 1 6 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r aTime series models face significant challenges in scaling to handle large and complex datasets, akin to the scaling achieved by large language models (LLMs). The unique characteristics of time series data and the computational demands of model scaling necessitate innovative approaches. While researchers have explored various architectures such as Transformers, LSTMs, and GRUs to address these challenges, we propose novel solution using RWKV-7, which incorporates meta-learning into its state update mechanism. By integrating RWKV-7s time mix and channel mix components into the transformerbased time series model Timer [Liu et al., 2024], we achieve substantial performance improvement of approximately 1.13x to 43.3x and 4.5x reduction in training time with 1/23 parameters, all while utilizing fewer parameters. Our code and model weights are publicly available for further research and //github.com/Alic development. Li/BlackGoose Rimer https :1This is an ongoing project Figure 1: The benchmarks reveal that Rimer, with significantly reduced parameter count of just 1.6 million, consistently outperforms or matches the performance of Timer, which relies on much larger 37.8 million parameters, across multiple metrics. approaches struggle to address effectively. Over the years, researchers have investigated numerous architectures to tackle these challenges [Zhang et al., 2025; Lang et al., ; Wang et al., ; Hou and Yu, 2024; ?], including transformers, Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). While these models excel at capturing temporal patterns in smaller-scale settings, their efficiency and performance often degrade when applied to large datasets, highlighting the need for innovative solutions that can scale without compromising accuracy. This gap in capability has motivated the development of new methodologies tailored to the demands of large-scale time series modeling. In this paper, we introduce novel approach to meet these needs through RWKV-7, an architecture that integrates meta-learning into its state update mechanism [Grazzi et al., 2024]. RWKV-7 features two core innovationstime mix and channel mix [Peng et al., 2023] which enhance its ability to model complex temporal dynamics while maintaining computational efficiency. By embedding these components into the transformer-based time series model Timer, we achieve remarkable 1.13x to 43.3x improvement in performance and 4.5x reduction in training time compared to existing methods with 1/23 parameters. Furthermore, our approach leverages fewer parameters, offering lightweight yet powerful solution for scaling time series models. Our contributions in this work are twofold: Revisiting RNNs for Time Series with RWKV-7: We reintroduce the recurrent neural network (RNN) paradigm to time series modeling by adopting RWKV-7, novel architecture tailored for largescale time series data. This approach harnesses the sequential processing strengths of RNNs while overcoming their traditional challenges in handling extensive datasets, resulting in improved scalability and performance. Benchmarking Against Transformer-Based Models: We perform comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate our RWKV-7-based model against previous transformer-based time series models. Our experiments highlight significant improvements, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.Figure 2: The RWKV-7 architecture is RNN model that processes sequences using repeated RWKV blocks, each containing:1.A time mix block to blend current and past information.2.WKV heads for attention-like processing with an internal state to maintain memory.A channel mix block to transform the data further. to address test time scaling [Sun et al., 2024] in time series models, utilizing adaptive computational techniques to maintain robust performance while preserving efficiency. Through extensive testing on diverse datasets, we showcase substantial gains in both speed and predictive accuracy, delivering scalable solution for real-world applications. This work pushes forward the field of time series modeling and offers actionable insights for deploying these models in large-scale, realtime settings.the core state update rule: Statet = Statet1 (cid:16) diag(wt) ˆκT (at (cid:17) ˆκt) + vT kt at (1)"

Existing long-form video generation frameworks lack automated planning, requiring manual input for storylines, scenes, cinematography, and character interactions, resulting in high costs and inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we present MovieAgent, an automated movie generation via multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) planning. MovieAgent offers two key advantages: 1) We firstly explore and define the paradigm of automated movie/long-video generation. Given a script and character bank, our MovieAgent can generates multi-scene, multi-shot long-form videos with a coherent narrative, while ensuring character consistency, synchronized subtitles, and stable audio throughout the film. 2) MovieAgent introduces a hierarchical CoT-based reasoning process to automatically structure scenes, camera settings, and cinematography, significantly reducing human effort. By employing multiple LLM agents to simulate the roles of a director, screenwriter, storyboard artist, and location manager, MovieAgent streamlines the production pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that MovieAgent achieves new state-of-the-art results in script faithfulness, character consistency, and narrative coherence. Our hierarchical framework takes a step forward and provides new insights into fully automated movie generation.

Federated Learning (FL) is a widely used framework for training models in a decentralized manner, ensuring that the central server does not have direct access to data from local clients. However, this approach may still fail to fully preserve data privacy, as models from local clients are exposed to the central server during the aggregation process. This issue becomes even more critical when training vision-language models (VLMs) with FL, as VLMs can easily memorize training data instances, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs). To address this challenge, we propose the FedRand framework, which avoids disclosing the full set of client parameters. In this framework, each client randomly selects subparameters of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from the server and keeps the remaining counterparts of the LoRA weights as private parameters. After training both parameters on the client's private dataset, only the non-private <PRE_TAG>client parameters</POST_TAG> are sent back to the server for aggregation. This approach mitigates the risk of exposing client-side VLM parameters, thereby enhancing data privacy. We empirically validate that FedRand improves robustness against MIAs compared to relevant baselines while achieving accuracy comparable to methods that communicate full LoRA parameters across several benchmark datasets.

Universal multimodal embedding models play a critical role in tasks such as interleaved image-text retrieval, multimodal RAG, and multimodal clustering. However, our empirical results indicate that existing LMM-based embedding models trained with the standard InfoNCE loss exhibit a high degree of overlap in similarity distribution between positive and negative pairs, making it challenging to distinguish hard negative pairs effectively. To deal with this issue, we propose a simple yet effective framework that dynamically improves the embedding model's representation learning for negative pairs based on their discriminative difficulty. Within this framework, we train a series of models, named LLaVE, and evaluate them on the MMEB benchmark, which covers 4 meta-tasks and 36 datasets. Experimental results show that LLaVE establishes stronger baselines that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while demonstrating strong scalability and efficiency. Specifically, LLaVE-2B surpasses the previous SOTA 7B models, while LLaVE-7B achieves a further performance improvement of 6.2 points. Although LLaVE is trained on image-text data, it can generalize to text-video retrieval tasks in a zero-shot manner and achieve strong performance, demonstrating its remarkable potential for transfer to other embedding tasks.

Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success across various natural language processing tasks, yet their high computational cost during inference remains a major bottleneck. This paper introduces Sparse Expert Activation Pruning (SEAP), a training-free pruning method that selectively retains task-relevant parameters to reduce inference overhead. Inspired by the clustering patterns of hidden states and activations in LLMs, SEAP identifies task-specific expert activation patterns and prunes the model while preserving task performance and enhancing computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that SEAP significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining competitive accuracy. Notably, at 50% pruning, SEAP surpasses both WandA and FLAP by over 20%, and at 20% pruning, it incurs only a 2.2% performance drop compared to the dense model. These findings highlight SEAP's scalability and effectiveness, making it a promising approach for optimizing large-scale LLMs.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), built on large-scale pre-trained vision towers and language models, have shown great capabilities in multimodal understanding. However, most existing MLLMs are trained on single-turn vision question-answering tasks, which do not accurately reflect real-world human conversations. In this paper, we introduce MMDiag, a multi-turn multimodal dialogue dataset. This dataset is collaboratively generated through deliberately designed rules and GPT assistance, featuring strong correlations between questions, between questions and images, and among different image regions; thus aligning more closely with real-world scenarios. MMDiag serves as a strong benchmark for multi-turn multimodal dialogue learning and brings more challenges to the grounding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Further, inspired by human vision processing, we present DiagNote, an MLLM equipped with multimodal grounding and reasoning capabilities. DiagNote consists of two modules (Deliberate and Gaze) interacting with each other to perform Chain-of-Thought and annotations respectively, throughout multi-turn dialogues. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of DiagNote in both grounding and jointly processing and reasoning with vision and language information over existing MLLMs.

Recent advancements in 2D-to-3D perception have significantly improved the understanding of 3D scenes from 2D images. However, existing methods face critical challenges, including limited generalization across scenes, suboptimal perception accuracy, and slow reconstruction speeds. To address these limitations, we propose Perception-Efficient 3D Reconstruction (PE3R), a novel framework designed to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. PE3R employs a feed-forward architecture to enable rapid 3D semantic field reconstruction. The framework demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization across diverse scenes and objects while significantly improving reconstruction speed. Extensive experiments on 2D-to-3D open-vocabulary segmentation and 3D reconstruction validate the effectiveness and versatility of PE3R. The framework achieves a minimum 9-fold speedup in 3D semantic field reconstruction, along with substantial gains in perception accuracy and reconstruction precision, setting new benchmarks in the field. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/hujiecpp/PE3R.

Consequently, the development of classification systems such as DetectGPT has become vital. These detectors are vulnerable to evasion techniques, as demonstrated in an experimental series: Systematic changes of the generative models' temperature proofed shallow learning-detectors to be the least reliable.

Although masked image generation models and masked diffusion models are designed with different motivations and objectives, we observe that they can be unified within a single framework. Building upon this insight, we carefully explore the design space of training and sampling, identifying key factors that contribute to both performance and efficiency. Based on the improvements observed during this exploration, we develop our model, referred to as eMIGM. Empirically, eMIGM demonstrates strong performance on ImageNet generation, as measured by Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, with similar number of function evaluations (NFEs) and model parameters, eMIGM outperforms the seminal VAR. Moreover, as NFE and model parameters increase, eMIGM achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models while requiring less than 40% of the NFE. Additionally, on ImageNet 512x512, with only about 60% of the NFE, eMIGM outperforms the state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models.

"Although masked image generation models and masked diffusion models are designed with different motivations and objectives, we observe that they can be unified within a single framework. Building upon this insight, we carefully explore the design space of training and sampling, identifying key factors that contribute to both performance and efficiency. Based on the improvements observed during this exploration, we develop our model, referred to as eMIGM. Empirically, eMIGM demonstrates strong performance on ImageNet generation, as measured by Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, with similar number of function evaluations (NFEs) and model parameters, eMIGM outperforms the seminal VAR. Moreover, as NFE and model parameters increase, eMIGM achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models while requiring less than 40% of the NFE. Additionally, on ImageNet 512x512, with only about 60% of the NFE, eMIGM outperforms the state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models."

Traditional agentic workflows rely on external prompts to manage interactions with tools and the environment, which limits the autonomy of reasoning models. We position Large Agent Models (LAMs) that internalize the generation of Chain-of-Action (CoA), enabling the model to autonomously decide when and how to use external tools. Our proposed AutoCoA framework combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), allowing the model to seamlessly switch between reasoning and action while efficiently managing environment interactions. Main components include step-level action triggering, trajectory-level CoA optimization, and an internal world model to reduce real-environment interaction costs. Evaluations on open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that AutoCoA-trained agent models significantly outperform ReAct-based workflows in task completion, especially in tasks that require long-term reasoning and multi-step actions.

Time series models face significant challenges in scaling to handle large and complex datasets, akin to the scaling achieved by large language models (LLMs). The unique characteristics of time series data and the computational demands of model scaling necessitate innovative approaches. While researchers have explored various architectures such as Transformers, LSTMs, and GRUs to address these challenges, we propose a novel solution using RWKV-7, which incorporates meta-learning into its state update mechanism. By integrating RWKV-7's time mix and channel mix components into the transformer-based time series model Timer, we achieve a substantial performance improvement of approximately 1.13 to 43.3x and a 4.5x reduction in training time with 1/23 parameters, all while utilizing fewer parameters.
