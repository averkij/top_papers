Transformer models, as the foundation of modern LLMs, offer strong baseline with excellent scaling properties. However, the traditional transformer architecture requires substantial computations and poses significant obstacles for large-scale training and practical deployment. In this survey, we offer systematic examination of innovative LLM architectures that address the inherent limitations of transformers and boost the efficiency. Starting from language modeling, this survey covers the background and technical details of linear and sparse sequence modeling methods, efficient full attention variants, sparse mixture-of-experts, hybrid model architectures incorporating the above techniques, and emerging diffusion LLMs. Additionally, we discuss applications of these techniques to other modalities and consider their wider implications for developing scalable, resource-aware foundation models. By grouping recent studies into the above category, this survey presents blueprint of modern efficient LLM architectures, and we hope this could help motivate future research toward more efficient, versatile AI systems.

Matrix-Game 2.0 can generate high-quality minute-level videos across diverse scenes at an ultra-fast speed of 25 FPS. We open-source our model weights and codebase to advance research in interactive world modeling.World models [2, 23, 31] have gained significant attention due to their capability to understand real-world interactions and predict future states [47]. By enabling intelligent agents to perceive their surroundings and respond to actions, these models reduce the cost of real-world trials and facilitate interactive simulation. Consequently, world models show great promise in fields such as game engines [9, 12, 42], autonomous driving [17], and spatial intelligence [2, 3, 29, 46]. Recent advances in video generation models [4, 21, 26, 40, 43] have shown remarkable progress in learning knowledge from large-scale real-world datasets, ranging from physical laws to interactive scenes. This demonstrates their huge potential to serve as world models. Among the various research directions in this domain, interactive long video generation [5, 6] has become increasingly important due to its practical applications, where long videos should be generated in real-time in response to continuous stream of user input. Specifically, when conditioned on user actions like camera movements and keyboard inputs, the model generates frames causally, enabling real-time user interaction. Despite impressive progress in interactive video generation, existing methods suffer from several significant challenges: Equal contribution. Project Lead. Corresponding author Technical Report. Figure 1: Real-time Interactive Generation Results. We introduce Matrix-Game 2.0, real-time interactive video generation model. By integrating action modules and few-step distillation, it can auto-regressively produce high-quality interactive videos given an input image in 25 FPS. The demonstrated results cover various scenes and diverse styles, demonstrating its powerful generation capabilities. 2 Figure 2: Pipelines of Matrix-Game 2.0. Lack of large-scale, high-quality interactive video datasets with rich annotations for training, such as accurate actions and camera dynamics, due to the high cost and difficulty of collection. Latency issues with bidirectional video diffusion models [23, 27, 57], where generating single frame requires processing the entire video. This makes them unsuitable for real-time, streaming applications where the model must adapt to dynamic user commands and produce frames on the fly. The quadratic scaling of compute and memory requirements with respect to frame length, along with the high number of denoising iterations, makes long video generation computationally intensive and economically impractical. Severe error accumulation in existing auto-regressive video diffusion models [9,19,40]. While these models generate the next frame based on previous frames, they often suffer from error accumulation during generation, leading to degraded video quality over time. To address these critical challenges in real-time interactive generation, we present Matrix-Game 2.0 - novel framework specifically designed to achieve both real-time performance and robust generalization across diverse scenarios. First, our technical core features video diffusion transformer with integrated action control modules, distilled into causal few-step auto-regressive model via Self-Forcing [18] based techniques. This architecture supports both training and inference through an efficient KV caching mechanism, achieving 25 FPS generation on single H100 GPU while maintaining minute-long temporal consistency and precise action controllability - even in complex wild scenes beyond the training distribution. The models strong generalization capability is enabled by another innovation of ours: comprehensive data production pipeline that solves fundamental limitations in interactive training data. The pipeline is based on Unreal Engine, including Navigation Mesh-based Path Planning System for data diversity and Quaternion Precision Optimization modules for accurate camera control. Moreover, for Grand Theft Auto V(GTA5) environment, we developed data recording system using Script Hook integration, which enables synchronized capture of visual content with corresponding user interactions. Together, these components produce large-scale datasets with frame-level annotations, addressing two critical needs: (1) precise alignment between visual content and control signals, and (2) effective modeling of dynamic in-game interactions. By simultaneously tackling the challenges of efficiency and controllability, Matrix-Game 2.0 makes significant strides in world modeling by introducing an efficient framework tailored for real-time simulation and interaction. To support continued progress in this area, we will release the code and weights of our pre-trained models.2.1 Controllable Video Generation With the rapid advancement of diffusion models [16, 36, 38], significant progress has been made in visual content generation fo"

Ovis2.5, a native-resolution vision transformer with multimodal reasoning, achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks through advanced training techniques and efficient scaling methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present Ovis2.5, a successor to Ovis2 designed for native-resolution visual perception and strong multimodal reasoning. Ovis2.5 integrates a native-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native, variable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and preserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense content like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to move beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including self-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional "thinking mode" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced accuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive five-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins with foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through large-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning enhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ multimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant end-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and Ovis2.5-2B. The latter continues the "small model, big performance" philosophy of Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the OpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a substantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter range; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size. Beyond aggregate scores, Ovis2.5 achieves leading results on STEM benchmarks, exhibits strong capabilities on grounding and video tasks, and achieves open-source SOTA at its scale for complex chart analysis.

This survey examines innovative architectures for large language models to enhance efficiency, covering linear and sparse sequence modeling, efficient attention mechanisms, sparse mixture-of-experts, hybrid models, and diffusion LLMs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have delivered impressive results in language understanding, generation, reasoning, and pushes the ability boundary of multimodal models. Transformer models, as the foundation of modern LLMs, offer a strong baseline with excellent scaling properties. However, the traditional transformer architecture requires substantial computations and poses significant obstacles for large-scale training and practical deployment. In this survey, we offer a systematic examination of innovative LLM architectures that address the inherent limitations of transformers and boost the efficiency. Starting from language modeling, this survey covers the background and technical details of linear and sparse sequence modeling methods, efficient full attention variants, sparse mixture-of-experts, hybrid model architectures incorporating the above techniques, and emerging diffusion LLMs. Additionally, we discuss applications of these techniques to other modalities and consider their wider implications for developing scalable, resource-aware foundation models. By grouping recent studies into the above category, this survey presents a blueprint of modern efficient LLM architectures, and we hope this could help motivate future research toward more efficient, versatile AI systems.

ComoRAG, an iterative retrieval-based approach, enhances long-context narrative comprehension by dynamically updating memory and generating probing queries, outperforming traditional RAG methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation, analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace. In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths, then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+ tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

Further analysis reveals that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

Matrix-Game 2.0 generates real-time interactive videos using few-step auto-regressive diffusion, addressing the limitations of lengthy inference in existing models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in interactive video generations have demonstrated diffusion model's potential as world models by capturing complex physical dynamics and interactive behaviors. However, existing interactive world models depend on bidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting real-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world dynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical context and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an interactive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step auto-regressive diffusion. Our framework consists of three key components: (1) A scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to effectively produce massive amounts (about 1200 hours) of video data with diverse interaction annotations; (2) An action injection module that enables frame-level mouse and keyboard inputs as interactive conditions; (3) A few-step distillation based on the casual architecture for real-time and streaming video generation. Matrix Game 2.0 can generate high-quality minute-level videos across diverse scenes at an ultra-fast speed of 25 FPS. We open-source our model weights and codebase to advance research in interactive world modeling.

Lumen is an end-to-end video relighting framework that uses a large-scale dataset of realistic and synthetic videos to achieve consistent lighting and foreground preservation in edited videos.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video relighting is a challenging yet valuable task, aiming to replace the background in videos while correspondingly adjusting the lighting in the foreground with harmonious blending. During translation, it is essential to preserve the original properties of the foreground, e.g., albedo, and propagate consistent relighting among temporal frames. In this paper, we propose Lumen, an end-to-end video relighting framework developed on large-scale video generative models, receiving flexible textual description for instructing the control of lighting and background. Considering the scarcity of high-qualified paired videos with the same foreground in various lighting conditions, we construct a large-scale dataset with a mixture of realistic and synthetic videos. For the synthetic domain, benefiting from the abundant 3D assets in the community, we leverage advanced 3D rendering engine to curate video pairs in diverse environments. For the realistic domain, we adapt a HDR-based lighting simulation to complement the lack of paired in-the-wild videos. Powered by the aforementioned dataset, we design a joint training curriculum to effectively unleash the strengths of each domain, i.e., the physical consistency in synthetic videos, and the generalized domain distribution in realistic videos. To implement this, we inject a domain-aware adapter into the model to decouple the learning of relighting and domain appearance distribution. We construct a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate Lumen together with existing methods, from the perspectives of foreground preservation and video consistency assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that Lumen effectively edit the input into cinematic relighted videos with consistent lighting and strict foreground preservation.

S^2-Guidance, a novel method using stochastic block-dropping, improves sample quality and prompt adherence in diffusion models by refining suboptimal predictions, outperforming Classifier-free Guidance and other advanced strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique in modern diffusion models for enhancing sample quality and prompt adherence. However, through an empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks, effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and other advanced guidance strategies. Our code will be released.

However, through an empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks, effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and other advanced guidance strategies. Our code will be released."

AuriStream, a biologically inspired two-stage model, encodes speech using cochlear tokens and an autoregressive sequence model, achieving state-of-the-art performance on speech tasks and generating interpretable audio continuations.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce AuriStream, a biologically inspired model for encoding speech via a two-stage framework inspired by the human auditory processing hierarchy. The first stage transforms raw audio into a time-frequency representation based on the human cochlea, from which we extract discrete cochlear tokens. The second stage applies an autoregressive sequence model over the cochlear tokens. AuriStream learns meaningful phoneme and word representations, and state-of-the-art lexical semantics. AuriStream shows competitive performance on diverse downstream SUPERB speech tasks. Complementing AuriStream's strong representational capabilities, it generates continuations of audio which can be visualized in a spectrogram space and decoded back into audio, providing insights into the model's predictions. In summary, we present a two-stage framework for speech representation learning to advance the development of more human-like models that efficiently handle a range of speech-based tasks.
