Index TermsMachine unlearning, visual analytics, model comparison, model evaluation, data privacy. I. INTRODUCTION ACHINE Unlearning (MU) refers to the process of making trained model forget specific data it was trained on, such that those data no longer influence the models behavior [1]. This capability has become increasingly important as individuals invoke the right to be forgotten [2] under data privacy laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [3]. Regulators have also begun to enforce this: in 2021 case, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ordered company to delete not only the unlawfully collected data but also any models derived from it [4]. Beyond legal compliance, the ability to reliably remove data is now recognized as critical component for ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of advanced AI systems [5]. However, naıvely retraining model from scratch for each unlearning request is Jaeung Lee, Yurim Jang, Simon S. Woo, and Jaemin Jo are with Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea.

Manuscript received xx; xx. highly inefficient since modern machine learning models often require significant amount of time and computational cost to train [6]. To address this, MU methods aim to approximate the result of retraining with minimal adjustments to the models parameters. We observe that researchers in this emerging field struggle to analyze and understand the behavior of different MU methods. We identify two main hurdles to this challenge. First, despite the recent introduction of MU methods [7] [11], there is still no standardized evaluation protocol for systematically comparing them. Due to the absence of such protocol, the MU methods have been separately assessed using disparate metrics [12][16]. This not only hinders direct comparisons among methods but also makes it difficult to understand nuanced trade-offs between the methods. Second, existing evaluations primarily rely on quantitative metrics, which offer limited insight into the behaviors of different methods and fail to uncover the underlying decision-making processes happening in the model, which is insufficient to address the analytic tasks we identified. For example, one important task in MU research is to evaluate to what extent an MU model satisfies the privacy principle. This principle states that after unlearning, it should be guaranteed that no residual signals of the forgotten data remain, thereby thwarting attack [17][21]. For instance, an attacker might query an online medical diagnostic model to check whether particular patients records still shape its responses, which is an example of membership inference attacks (MIAs). Relying on metrics alone is insufficient for such an evaluation, as such summary metrics would fail to reveal which specific samples remain vulnerable or how model behavior exhibits subtle shifts after unlearning. These limitations call for an interactive approach that allows researchers to simulate attacks and observe how the model responds. To address the two hurdles, we present Unlearning Comparator, visual analytics system that enables systematic and multi-foci comparison between MU methods. Our system supports the side-by-side comparison between two models at three aspects: metrics, embeddings, and attacks. By spanning classand instance-level data as well as output and internal representations, our system aims to show how thoroughly each method removes targeted data without affecting the remainder, highlighting subtle representation changes that aggregate metrics overlook. In our case study and interviews, we demonstrate how this systematic comparison not only clarifies each methods behavior but also leads to refinements and new JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XX 2 designs for novel MU method. We contribute: design study with MU researchers, incorporating domain analysis to identify user tasks and derive fourstage workflow; Unlearning Comparator, visual analytics system that supports the comparative evaluation of MU methods through visualizations of metrics, embeddings, and simulated attacks; The first (to our knowledge) visual analysis of prominent MU methods, which uncovers overlooked behavioral patterns and informs the development of novel, more effective MU method, Guided Unlearning (GU).

A visual analytics system, Unlearning Comparator, facilitates the evaluation of Machine Unlearning methods by comparing model behaviors and simulating membership inference attacks to assess privacy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove target training data from a trained model so that the removed data no longer influences the model's behavior, fulfilling "right to be forgotten" obligations under data privacy laws. Yet, we observe that researchers in this rapidly emerging field face challenges in analyzing and understanding the behavior of different MU methods, especially in terms of three fundamental principles in MU: accuracy, efficiency, and privacy. Consequently, they often rely on aggregate metrics and ad-hoc evaluations, making it difficult to accurately assess the trade-offs between methods. To fill this gap, we introduce a visual analytics system, Unlearning Comparator, designed to facilitate the systematic evaluation of MU methods. Our system supports two important tasks in the evaluation process: model comparison and attack simulation. First, it allows the user to compare the behaviors of two models, such as a model generated by a certain method and a retrained baseline, at class-, instance-, and layer-levels to better understand the changes made after unlearning. Second, our system simulates membership inference attacks (MIAs) to evaluate the privacy of a method, where an attacker attempts to determine whether specific data samples were part of the original training set. We evaluate our system through a case study visually analyzing prominent MU methods and demonstrate that it helps the user not only understand model behaviors but also gain insights that can inform the improvement of MU methods.
