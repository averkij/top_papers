Text:"Soft Robotic Dynamic In-Hand Pen Spinning Yunchao Yao1 Uksang Yoo 1 Jean Oh 1 Christopher Atkeson 1 Jeffrey Ichnowski 1 4 2 0 N 9 1 ] . [ 1 4 3 7 2 1 . 1 1 4 2 : r Abstract Dynamic in-hand manipulation remains challenging task for soft robotic systems that have demonstrated advantages in safe compliant interactions but struggle with high-speed dynamic tasks. In this work, we present SWIFT, system for learning dynamic tasks using soft and compliant robotic hand. Unlike previous works that rely on simulation, quasi-static actions and precise object models, the proposed system learns to spin pen through trial-and-error using only real-world data without requiring explicit prior knowledge of the pens physical attributes. With self-labeled trials sampled from the real world, the system discovers the set of pen grasping and spinning primitive parameters that enables soft hand to spin pen robustly and reliably. After 130 sampled actions per object, SWIFT achieves 100 % success rate across three pens with different weights and weight distributions, demonstrating the systems generalizability and robustness to changes in object properties. The results highlight the potential for soft robotic end-effectors to perform dynamic tasks including rapid in-hand manipulation. We also demonstrate that SWIFT generalizes to spinning items with different shapes and weights such as brush and screwdriver which we spin with 10/10 and 5/10 success rates respectively. Videos, data, and code are available at https://soft-spin.github.io. I. INTRODUCTION In-hand dexterity is crucial for many tasks common in our daily lives [1] and the ability to re-orient objects in the hand and re-grasp them is useful to perform these tasks efficiently and effectively [2, 3]. The compliance of soft robotic endeffectors deformable fingers allows them to be robust to perturbations [4, 5] and enables them to interact with their environments safely [6, 7]. However, compliance makes it hard to move the fingers both q"
