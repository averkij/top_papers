However, existing reviews primarily treat MI as an observational science, summarizing analytical insights while lacking systematic framework for actionable intervention. To bridge this gap, we present practical survey structured around the pipeline: Locate, Steer, and Improve. We formally categorize Localizing (diagnosis) and Steering (intervention) methods based on specific Interpretable Objects to establish rigorous intervention protocol. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this framework enables tangible improvements in Alignment, Capability, and Efficiency, effectively operationalizing MI as an actionable methodology for model optimization. With actionable mechanistic interpretability evolving at fast pace, we pledge to keep this survey up to date, ensuring it reflects the cutting-edge advances in this area.

Text:"InT: Self-Proposed Interventions Enable Credit Assignment in LLM Reasoning Matthew Y. R.

[ 1 9 0 2 4 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r Figure 1: Intervention training (InT) for improving credit assignment. InT proposes single-step interventions to replace incorrect intermediate steps in reasoning traces (1). Conditioned on these localized corrections, the model can generate counterfactual continuations that succeed where the original failed (2). We then perform supervised fine-tuning on these interventions, enabling effective credit assignment by upweighting the likelihood of the interventions in place of the mistakes. Abstract: Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective at improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While natural remedy is to train process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying model-generated solution is easier than generating correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes single-step intervention to redirect the tra"

Mechanistic interpretability is presented as an actionable framework for understanding and optimizing large language models through systematic localization, steering, and improvement methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) has emerged as a vital approach to demystify the opaque decision-making of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing reviews primarily treat MI as an observational science, summarizing analytical insights while lacking a systematic framework for actionable intervention. To bridge this gap, we present a practical survey structured around the pipeline: "Locate, Steer, and Improve." We formally categorize Localizing (diagnosis) and Steering (intervention) methods based on specific Interpretable Objects to establish a rigorous intervention protocol. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this framework enables tangible improvements in Alignment, Capability, and Efficiency, effectively operationalizing MI as an actionable methodology for model optimization.

Intervention Training improves large language model reasoning by enabling fine-grained credit assignment through targeted corrections that localize errors and enhance reinforcement learning performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective at improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b.

Основная проблема стандартного reinforcement learning состоит в том, что он присваивает награду только на уровне финального ответа, штрафуя все этапы рассуждения при неправильном результате и поощряя их при правильном, что приводит к ошибкам в присваивании кредита. InT решает эту проблему, заставляя модель самостоятельно выполнять детальное присваивание кредита, предлагая целевые исправления ошибок в своих цепочках рассуждения и сосредотачивая обучение на конкретном шаге, вызвавшем сбой. Применение этого метода к моделям показало улучшение точности на 14% и превосходство над более крупными открытыми моделями в задачах математического рассуждения.",

A comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM-based data agents across diverse data science tasks demonstrates superior performance for multimodal agents while highlighting persistent challenges in unstructured data domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent LLM-based data agents aim to automate data science tasks ranging from data analysis to deep learning. However, the open-ended nature of real-world data science problems, which often span multiple taxonomies and lack standard answers, poses a significant challenge for evaluation. To address this, we introduce DSAEval, a benchmark comprising 641 real-world data science problems grounded in 285 diverse datasets, covering both structured and unstructured data (e.g., vision and text). DSAEval incorporates three distinctive features: (1) Multimodal Environment Perception, which enables agents to interpret observations from multiple modalities including text and vision; (2) Multi-Query Interactions, which mirror the iterative and cumulative nature of real-world data science projects; and (3) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation, which provides a holistic assessment across reasoning, code, and results. We systematically evaluate 11 advanced agentic LLMs using DSAEval. Our results show that Claude-Sonnet-4.5 achieves the strongest overall performance, GPT-5.2 is the most efficient, and MiMo-V2-Flash is the most cost-effective. We further demonstrate that multimodal perception consistently improves performance on vision-related tasks, with gains ranging from 2.04% to 11.30%. Overall, while current data science agents perform well on structured data and routine data anlysis workflows, substantial challenges remain in unstructured domains. Finally, we offer critical insights and outline future research directions to advance the development of data science agents.
