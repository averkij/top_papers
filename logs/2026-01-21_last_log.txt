Panov 1 2 Project Page: avanturist322.github.io/KAGEBench 6 2 0 2 0 2 ] . [ 1 2 3 2 4 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r aPixel-based reinforcement learning agents often fail under purely visual distribution shift even when latent dynamics and rewards are unchanged, but existing benchmarks entangle multiple sources of shift and hinder systematic analysis. We introduce KAGE-Env, JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying control problem fixed. By construction, varying visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of pixel policy, providing clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 trainevaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using standard PPOCNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign. Several shifts preserve forward motion while breaking task completion, showing that return alone can obscure generalization failures. Finally, the fully vectorized JAX implementation enables up to 33M environment steps per second on single GPU, enabling fast and reproducible sweeps over visual factors. Code: https://avanturist322. github.io/KAGEBench/. 1. Introduction Reinforcement learning (RL) agents trained from highdimensional pixel observations are brittle to changes in appearance, lighting, and other visual nuisance factors (Cetin et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2023; Klepach et al., 2025). Policies that perform well in-distribution can degrade sharply under 1MIRIAI, Moscow, Russia 2Cognitive AI Systems Lab, Correspondence to: Egor Cherepanov Moscow, Russia. <cherepanov.e@miriai.org>. Preprint. January 21, 2026. 1 Figure 1. Representative observations from KAGE-Env illustrating controlled, known-axis visual variation. Each panel differs along one or more explicitly configurable axes, including background imagery and color, agent appearance and animation, moving distractors, photometric filters, and dynamic lighting effects, while task semantics and underlying dynamics are held fixed. purely visual distribution shifts, even when task semantics, transition dynamics, and rewards are unchanged (Staroverov et al., 2023; Kachaev et al., 2025; Mirjalili et al., 2025). This brittleness poses fundamental obstacle to real-world deployment, where observations inevitably vary due to viewpoint changes, illumination, surface appearance, and sensor noise while the control-relevant latent state remains fixed (Raileanu et al., 2020; Kostrikov et al., 2020; Kirilenko et al., 2023; Korchemnyi et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Ugadiarov et al., 2026). As result, pixel-based RL policies that rely on incidental visual correlations can fail abruptly despite convergence, undermining reliability in robotics, autonomous navigation, and interactive environments (Stone et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2023). More broadly, visual generalization is needed wherever models must robustly extract information from visual structure, even in scientific texts and figures (Sherki et al., 2025). Despite substantial progress in representation learning (Mazoure et al., 2021; Rahman & Xue, 2022; Ortiz et al., 2024) and data augmentation (Laskin et al., 2020; Raileanu et al., 2020; Hansen & Wang, 2021), understanding visual generalization failures remains challenging. central obstacle lies in evaluation benchmarks, which often entangle multiple KAGE-Bench: Known-Axis Visual Generalization Figure 2. KAGE-Bench: Motivation. Existing generalization benchmarks entangle multiple sources of visual shift between training and evaluation, making failures difficult to attribute. KAGEBench factorizes observations into independently controllable axes and constructs trainevaluation splits that vary one (or selected set) of axes at time, enabling precise diagnosis of which visual factors drive generalization gaps. The observation vector notation ψ is used for intuition only. visual and structural changes such as background appearance, geometry, dynamics, and distractors (Cobbe et al., 2020; Stone et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2023). In these settings, trainevaluation performance gaps cannot be cleanly attributed to specific sources of shift, and failures may reflect visual sensitivity, altered task structure, or interactions between confounded factors. Compounding this issue, many pixel-based RL environments are computationally expensive to simulate, limiting large-scale ablations and slowing hypothesis testing. We address these limitations with KAGE-Bench (KnownAxis Generalization Evaluation Benchmark), visual generalization benchmark in which sources of distribution shift are isolated by construction. KAGE-Bench is built on KAGE-Env (Figure 1), JAX-native (Bradbury et al., 2018) 2D platformer whose observation process is factorized into independently controllable visual axes while latent dynamics and rewards are held fixed (see Figure 2). Under this known-axis design, each axis corresponds to well-defined component of the observation kernel, and any trainevaluation performance difference arises solely from how fixed observation-based policy responds to different renderings of the same latent states, enabling unambiguous attribution of visual generalization failures. Systematic analysis of visual generalization requires evaluating many controlled shifts at scale. KAGE-Env is implemented entirely in JAX with end-to-end jit compilation and vectorized execution via vmap and lax.scan, enabling efficient large-batch simulation on single accelIn practice, this design scales up to 216 parallel erator. environments on one GPU and achieves up to 33M environment steps per second (see Figure 3), making exhaustive sweeps over visual parameters and fine-grained diagnosis of generalization behavior feasible. 1https://colab.research.google.com/ (a) Easy configuration.

LightOnOCR-2-1B is a compact 1B-parameter vision-language model that performs end-to-end document image-to-text conversion with improved localization and robustness through specialized training techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present LightOnOCR-2-1B, a 1B-parameter end-to-end multilingual vision--language model that converts document images (e.g., PDFs) into clean, naturally ordered text without brittle OCR pipelines. Trained on a large-scale, high-quality distillation mix with strong coverage of scans, French documents, and scientific PDFs, LightOnOCR-2 achieves state-of-the-art results on OlmOCR-Bench while being 9times smaller and substantially faster than prior best-performing models. We further extend the output format to predict normalized bounding boxes for embedded images, introducing localization during pretraining via a resume strategy and refining it with RLVR using IoU-based rewards. Finally, we improve robustness with checkpoint averaging and task-arithmetic merging. We release model checkpoints under Apache 2.0, and publicly release the dataset and LightOnOCR-bbox-bench evaluation under their respective licenses.

KAGE-Env is a JAX-native 2D platformer environment that isolates visual shifts from underlying control problems, enabling systematic analysis of visual generalization in reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Pixel-based reinforcement learning agents often fail under purely visual distribution shift even when latent dynamics and rewards are unchanged, but existing benchmarks entangle multiple sources of shift and hinder systematic analysis. We introduce KAGE-Env, a JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying control problem fixed. By construction, varying a visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of a pixel policy, providing a clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign. Several shifts preserve forward motion while breaking task completion, showing that return alone can obscure generalization failures. Finally, the fully vectorized JAX implementation enables up to 33M environment steps per second on a single GPU, enabling fast and reproducible sweeps over visual factors.

"KAGE-Env is a JAX-native 2D platformer environment that isolates visual shifts from underlying control problems, enabling systematic analysis of visual generalization in reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Pixel-based reinforcement learning agents often fail under purely visual distribution shift even when latent dynamics and rewards are unchanged, but existing benchmarks entangle multiple sources of shift and hinder systematic analysis. We introduce KAGE-Env, a JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying control problem fixed. By construction, varying a visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of a pixel policy, providing a clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign. Several shifts preserve forward motion while breaking task completion, showing that return alone can obscure generalization failures. Finally, the fully vectorized JAX implementation enables up to 33M environment steps per second on a single GPU, enabling fast and reproducible sweeps over visual factors.

FantasyVLN presents a unified implicit reasoning framework for vision-and-language navigation that enhances reasoning capabilities without explicit token overhead, achieving real-time performance with improved accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Achieving human-level performance in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an embodied agent to jointly understand multimodal instructions and visual-spatial context while reasoning over long action sequences. Recent works, such as NavCoT and NavGPT-2, demonstrate the potential of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for improving interpretability and long-horizon planning. Moreover, multimodal extensions like OctoNav-R1 and CoT-VLA further validate CoT as a promising pathway toward human-like navigation reasoning. However, existing approaches face critical drawbacks: purely textual CoTs lack spatial grounding and easily overfit to sparse annotated reasoning steps, while multimodal CoTs incur severe token inflation by generating imagined visual observations, making real-time navigation impractical. In this work, we propose FantasyVLN, a unified implicit reasoning framework that preserves the benefits of CoT reasoning without explicit token overhead. Specifically, imagined visual tokens are encoded into a compact latent space using a pretrained Visual AutoRegressor (VAR) during CoT reasoning training, and the model jointly learns from textual, visual, and multimodal CoT modes under a unified multi-CoT strategy. At inference, our model performs direct instruction-to-action mapping while still enjoying reasoning-aware representations. Extensive experiments on LH-VLN show that our approach achieves reasoning-aware yet real-time navigation, improving success rates and efficiency while reducing inference latency by an order of magnitude compared to explicit CoT methods.
