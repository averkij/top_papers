[ 1 5 7 0 3 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r METIS: Mentoring Engine for Thoughtful Inquiry & Solutions Abhinav Rajeev Kumar, Dhruv Trehan, Paras Chopra Lossfunk {abhinav.kumar, dhruv.trehan, paras}@lossfunk.com Many students lack access to expert research mentorship. We ask whether an AI mentor can move undergraduates from an idea to paper. We build METIS, tool-augmented, stage-aware assistant with literature search, curated guidelines, methodology checks, and memory. We evaluate METIS against GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 across six writing stages using LLM-as-a-judge pairwise preferences, student-persona rubrics, short multi-turn tutoring, and evidence/compliance checks. On 90 single-turn prompts, LLM judges preferred METIS to Claude Sonnet 4.5 in 71% and to GPT-5 in 54%. Student scores (clarity/actionability/constraint-fit; 90 prompts 3 judges) are higher across stages. In multi-turn sessions (five scenarios/agent), METIS yields slightly higher final quality than GPT-5. Gains concentrate in document-grounded stages (D F), consistent with stage-aware routing and grounding; failure modes include premature tool routing, shallow grounding, and occasional stage misclassification. Introduction Large language models can explain, suggest, and critique. But can one mentor student or early-career researcher from an initial, rough idea to publishable paper? We study this question with METIS, an AI research mentor whose primary goal is to guide undergraduates from ideation to publishable conference paper. METIS grounds its advice in conference instructions, research guides, and literature (arXiv/OpenReview) and keeps context across sessions so learners can make steady progress over weeks. This paper contributes: 1. practical mentoring workflow and stage-aware evaluation that turns research mentorship into concrete tasks; 2. simple, inspectable system with tools for literature search, guidelines retrieval, methodology checks, and memory; 3. an empirical comparison to GPT-5 and "

AI mentor METIS outperforms GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 in supporting undergraduate research writing across multiple stages, with higher student scores and improved document-grounded outputs, though challenges remain in tool routing and stage classification.  					AI-generated summary 				 Many students lack access to expert research mentorship. We ask whether an AI mentor can move undergraduates from an idea to a paper. We build METIS, a tool-augmented, stage-aware assistant with literature search, curated guidelines, methodology checks, and memory. We evaluate METIS against GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 across six writing stages using LLM-as-a-judge pairwise preferences, student-persona rubrics, short multi-turn tutoring, and evidence/compliance checks. On 90 single-turn prompts, LLM judges preferred METIS to Claude Sonnet 4.5 in 71% and to GPT-5 in 54%. Student scores (clarity/actionability/constraint-fit; 90 prompts x 3 judges) are higher across stages. In multi-turn sessions (five scenarios/agent), METIS yields slightly higher final quality than GPT-5. Gains concentrate in document-grounded stages (D-F), consistent with stage-aware routing and groundings failure modes include premature tool routing, shallow grounding, and occasional stage misclassification.

Система использует инструменты для поиска литературы, проверки методологии и сохранения контекста беседы, что делает её более специализированной, чем базовые LLM. Эксперименты показали, что METIS превосходит GPT-5 и Claude Sonnet 4.5 по предпочтениям судей и оценкам студентов, особенно на этапах, связанных с анализом источников. Основные проблемы системы связаны с неправильной маршрутизацией инструментов и ошибками в определении текущего этапа написания.",
