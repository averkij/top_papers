[ 1 3 5 2 3 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r Hybrid Protocol for Large-Scale Semantic Dataset Generation in Low-Resource Languages: The Turkish Semantic Relations Corpus Ebubekir Tosun ebubekirsoftware@gmail.com Mehmet Emin Buldur mehmeteminbuldur@outlook.com Özay Ezerceli ezerceli804@gmail.com Mahmoud ElHussieni mahmoud.elhussieni@outlook.comWe present hybrid methodology for generating large-scale semantic relationship datasets in low-resource languages, demonstrated through comprehensive Turkish semantic relations corpus. Our approach integrates three phases: (1) FastText embeddings with Agglomerative Clustering to identify semantic clusters, (2) Gemini 2.5-Flash for automated semantic relationship classification, and (3) integration with curated dictionary sources. The resulting dataset comprises 843,000 unique Turkish semantic pairs across three relationship types (synonyms, antonyms, co-hyponyms) representing 10 scale increase over existing resources at minimal cost ($65). We validate the dataset through two downstream tasks: an embedding model achieving 90% top-1 retrieval accuracy and classification model attaining 90% F1-macro. Our scalable protocol addresses critical data scarcity in Turkish NLP and demonstrates applicability to other lowresource languages. We publicly release the dataset and models.Turkish, despite having population of over 88 million speakers, lacks comprehensive semantic relationship datasets comparable to those available for English and other resource-rich languages (Miller, 1995; Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012). This scarcity impedes the development of semantic parsing systems, word sense disambiguation tools, and semantic similarity models for Turkish NLP applications. While significant efforts have been made to construct Turkish resources through manual annotation and dictionary mining (Bakay et al., 2021; Ehsani et al., 2018), the limited scale and domain coverage of existing resources present bottleneck for modern neural NLP systems that require millions of training examples (Devlin et al., 2019). The challenge of building semantic resources for morphologically rich languages like Turkish is 1 compounded by several factors. First, the agglutinative nature of Turkish means that single root can generate hundreds of valid word forms through productive suffixation, requiring substantially larger vocabularies to achieve equivalent coverage compared to analytic languages. Second, existing resources such as Turkish Tree Bank (Ehsani et al., 2018) and KeNet (Bakay et al., 2021) rely primarily on translation-based projections from English WordNet or limited manual curation, inheriting biases and leaving domain-specific terminology (particularly in legal, medical, and technical domains) largely uncovered. Third, the cost of manual annotation at scale is prohibitive for academic research budgets. We propose hybrid protocol that targets both computational efficiency and linguistic quality. The method proceeds in three phases. Context Preparation We start from an expertcurated lexicon of 77,000 terms and expand it to 110,000 entries using Named Entity Recognitionbased augmentation. We then compute FastText embeddings and apply Agglomerative Clustering, yielding 13,000 semantic clusters that act as contextual structure for downstream relationship classification. LLM-Based Semantic Enrichment In the second phase, we employ Gemini 2.5-Flash to automatically induce and label diverse semantic relationships within clusters. The model exploits both cluster-level context and its multilingual knowledge to generate high-quality relationship labels at an overall cost of about $65. Dictionary Integration Finally, we incorporate an external Turkish Synonym Dictionary comprising roughly 20,000 entries. After applying strict filters that retain only high-precision cases with at most two synonym candidates, we obtain 16,000 validated synonym pairs. This hybrid design couples large-scale automation with explicit quality control and yields 843,000 unique semantic pairs, while dictionary-based validation helps preserve semantic coherence across the induced relations. We make three primary contributions: 1. scalable hybrid methodology combining embedding-based clustering with LLM enrichment that is generalizable to other lowresource languages with minimal languagespecific adaptation. 2. The Turkish Semantic Relations Corpus, comprising 843,000 annotated semantic pairs across three relationship types (synonym, antonym, co-hyponym) in JSONL format, representing the largest native Turkish semantic resource to date. 3. Validation through downstream models: an embedding model achieving 90% top-1 retrieval accuracy for synonym pairs and classification model achieving 90% F1-macro, demonstrating the datasets utility for training production-quality semantic systems.2.2 LLM-Augmented Dataset Generation The emergence of large language models has opened new possibilities for dataset generation at scale. Recent work has demonstrated that LLMs can effectively generate training data for various NLP tasks, including semantic similarity (Schick and Schütze, 2021), natural language inference (Wang et al., 2021), and question answering (Alberti et al., 2019). The key insight is that LLMs, having been trained on massive multilingual corpora, encode substantial world knowledge that can be extracted through careful prompting. Several studies have specifically examined LLMgenerated semantic relationships. Chen et al. (2023) showed that GPT-4 can generate highquality synonym and antonym pairs with accuracy comparable to crowdsourced annotations when provided with appropriate context. Kumar et al. (2023) demonstrated that data augmentation through LLM paraphrasing significantly improves downstream task performance for low-resource settings. Our work extends this line of research by combining LLM generation with clustering-based context provision and dictionary validation. 2.1 Semantic Resources for Low-Resource 2.3 Embedding-Based Clustering for Languages Semantic Organization The construction of large-scale semantic resources has historically been dominated by manual curation efforts. Princeton WordNet (Miller, 1995) established the paradigm of organizing lexical knowledge through synsets connected by semantic relations, inspiring similar projects across dozens of languages through the Global WordNet Association (Bond and Paik, 2012). However, the laborintensive nature of WordNet construction has limite"

[ 1 1 5 2 3 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r Beyond Cosine Similarity: Taming Semantic Drift and Antonym Intrusion in 15-Million Node Turkish Synonym Graph Ebubekir Tosun ebubekirsoftware@gmail.com Mehmet Emin Buldur mehmeteminbuldur@outlook.com Özay Ezerceli ezerceli804@gmail.com Mahmoud ElHussieni mahmoud.elhussieni@outlook.comNeural embeddings have notorious blind spot: they cant reliably tell synonyms apart from antonyms. Consequently, increasing similarity thresholds often fails to prevent opposites from being grouped together. Weve built large-scale semantic clustering system specifically designed to tackle this problem headon. Our pipeline chews through 15 million lexical items, evaluates massive 520 million potential relationships, and ultimately generates 2.9 million high-precision semantic clusters. The system makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce labeled dataset of 843,000 concept pairs spanning synonymy, antonymy, and co-hyponymy, constructed via Gemini 2.5Flash LLM augmentation and verified using human-curated dictionary resources. Second, we propose specialized three-way semantic relation discriminator that achieves 90% macro-F1, enabling robust disambiguation beyond raw embedding similarity. Third, we introduce novel soft-to-hard clustering algorithm that mitigates semantic drift preventing erroneous transitive chains (e.g., hot spicy pain depression) while simultaneously resolving polysemy. Our approach employs topology-aware two-stage expansionpruning procedure with topological voting, ensuring that each term is assigned to exactly one semantically coherent cluster. The resulting resource enables high-precision semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation, particularly for morphologically rich and low-resource languages where existing synonym databases remain sparse.The foundational assumption underlying most neural semantic search systems that high cosine similarity between embedding vectors correlates with synonymy is demonstrably false. Embedding models trained on contrastive objectives (Wang and Isola, 2020) or word2vec-style objectives (Levy 1 and Goldberg, 2014) optimize for capturing distributional similarity, which conflates multiple semantic relationships into single continuous measure (Elekes et al., 2017; Schneidermann et al., 2020). Antonyms and synonyms alike often occupy proximate regions in embedding space (Scheible et al., 2013; Rizkallah et al., 2020; Samenko et al., 2020) because they appear in nearly identical linguistic contexts (Liu et al., 2017; Chaurasia and McDonnell, 2016), merely differing in implicit negation or opposition. This issue is especially pronounced when synonym databases are built by applying high similarity cutoff (e.g., cosine similarity 0.85), which often admits false positives such as antonyms or broadly related terms. At scale, two factors further aggravate semantic ambiguity in graph clustering. First, modularitybased methods such as Louvain (Blondel et al., 2008) and Leiden (Traag et al., 2019) impose hard partitions, forcing polysemous words into single cluster. For example, the Turkish word yüz (face / 100) cannot be represented in multiple senses simultaneously, which either removes valid synonym links or collapses unrelated regions into noisy clusters. Second, semantic drift arises from transitivity: chains of locally plausible links can connect semantically distant concepts (e.g., Sıcak hot Acı spicy Üzüntü pain Depresyon depression), and standard clustering methods (e.g., connected components or hierarchical agglomeration) typically cannot distinguish such spurious paths from genuine synonym structure. These difficulties are amplified in morphologically rich, non-English settings. Turkish, in particular, lacks large machine-readable synonym resources comparable to WordNet (Miller, 1995) or BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012). Existing resources suffer from two fundamental limitations: (1) they are sparse, containing insufficient coverage of domain-specific terminology (particularly in legal, medical, and technical domains); (2) they are brittle, often created through heuristic rule-based systems or simple distributional similarity thresholds without explicit disambiguation of semantic relationships. The construction of Turkish synonym resource at scale requires overcoming both antonym intrusion (false positives) and semantic drift (transitivity artifacts). This paper contributes three substantial advances addressing these challenges: Large-Scale Disambiguated Training Dataset We present rigorous methodology for generating 843,000 labeled semantic relationship pairs (Synonym, Antonym, Co-hyponym classes) through LLM-augmented synthesis paired with high-confidence dictionary extraction. We generated this dataset using Gemini 2.5-Flash (Comanici et al., 2025) for about $65 which is pretty costeffective, all things considered. It serves dual purpose: its novel research contribution in its own right, and it provides the training foundation for our discriminator model. The dataset strikes balance between synthetic LLM-generated pairs (827,000 instances) and carefully curated dictionary entries (16,000 instances). Whats especially useful here is that weve established reproducible pipeline that anyone can use to generate supervised semantic relationship data for any language as long as youve got sufficient terminological resources to work with. Specialized Multi-Class Discriminator Instead of just tweaking unsupervised similarity thresholds and hoping for the best, we train explicit three-way classifiers that can confidently tell synonyms apart from antonyms and co-hyponyms. Our best model hits 90% F1-macro with confidence scores above 0.98 on clear-cut cases, and weve validated that it shows solid cross-model consensus in practice. Think of this discriminator as strict semantic gatekeeper which it only lets through high-confidence synonym predictions (confidence 0.70) while actively filtering out antonyms and those murky low-confidence co-hyponyms. Novel Disambiguation-Aware Clustering Algorithm We propose two-stage graph clustering procedure (Expansion followed by Reduction/Pruning) that departs from standard community detection. In the Expansion stage, we apply soft clustering via overlap-based neighbor inclusion, allowing terms to participate in multiple candidate clusters to reflect polysemy. In the Reduction stage, we resolve ambiguity through topological voting, threelevel hierarchical sc"

A framework for generating structured counterfactual pairs using LLMs and SCMs enables improved evaluation and analysis of concept-based explanations in high-stakes domains.  					AI-generated summary 				 Concept-based explanations quantify how high-level concepts (e.g., gender or experience) influence model behavior, which is crucial for decision-makers in high-stakes domains. Recent work evaluates the faithfulness of such explanations by comparing them to reference causal effects estimated from counterfactuals. In practice, existing benchmarks rely on costly human-written counterfactuals that serve as an imperfect proxy. To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets containing structural counterfactual pairs: LIBERTy (LLM-based Interventional Benchmark for Explainability with Reference Targets). LIBERTy is grounded in explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) of the text generation, interventions on a concept propagate through the SCM until an LLM generates the counterfactual. We introduce three datasets (disease detection, CV screening, and workplace violence prediction) together with a new evaluation metric, order-faithfulness. Using them, we evaluate a wide range of methods across five models and identify substantial headroom for improving concept-based explanations. LIBERTy also enables systematic analysis of model sensitivity to interventions: we find that proprietary LLMs show markedly reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation. Overall, LIBERTy provides a much-needed benchmark for developing faithful explainability methods.

A large-scale semantic clustering system addresses the limitation of neural embeddings in distinguishing synonyms from antonyms through a specialized three-way discriminator and novel clustering algorithm.  					AI-generated summary 				 Neural embeddings have a notorious blind spot: they can't reliably tell synonyms apart from antonyms. Consequently, increasing similarity thresholds often fails to prevent opposites from being grouped together. We've built a large-scale semantic clustering system specifically designed to tackle this problem head on. Our pipeline chews through 15 million lexical items, evaluates a massive 520 million potential relationships, and ultimately generates 2.9 million high-precision semantic clusters. The system makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce a labeled dataset of 843,000 concept pairs spanning synonymy, antonymy, and co-hyponymy, constructed via Gemini 2.5-Flash LLM augmentation and verified using human-curated dictionary resources. Second, we propose a specialized three-way semantic relation discriminator that achieves 90% macro-F1, enabling robust disambiguation beyond raw embedding similarity. Third, we introduce a novel soft-to-hard clustering algorithm that mitigates semantic drift preventing erroneous transitive chains (e.g., hot -> spicy -> pain -> depression) while simultaneously resolving polysemy. Our approach employs a topology-aware two-stage expansion-pruning procedure with topological voting, ensuring that each term is assigned to exactly one semantically coherent cluster. The resulting resource enables high-precision semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation, particularly for morphologically rich and low-resource languages where existing synonym databases remain sparse.

"A large-scale semantic clustering system addresses the limitation of neural embeddings in distinguishing synonyms from antonyms through a specialized three-way discriminator and novel clustering algorithm.  					AI-generated summary 				 Neural embeddings have a notorious blind spot: they can't reliably tell synonyms apart from antonyms. Consequently, increasing similarity thresholds often fails to prevent opposites from being grouped together. We've built a large-scale semantic clustering system specifically designed to tackle this problem head on. Our pipeline chews through 15 million lexical items, evaluates a massive 520 million potential relationships, and ultimately generates 2.9 million high-precision semantic clusters. The system makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce a labeled dataset of 843,000 concept pairs spanning synonymy, antonymy, and co-hyponymy, constructed via Gemini 2.5-Flash LLM augmentation and verified using human-curated dictionary resources. Second, we propose a specialized three-way semantic relation discriminator that achieves 90% macro-F1, enabling robust disambiguation beyond raw embedding similarity. Third, we introduce a novel soft-to-hard clustering algorithm that mitigates semantic drift preventing erroneous transitive chains (e.g., hot -> spicy -> pain -> depression) while simultaneously resolving polysemy. Our approach employs a topology-aware two-stage expansion-pruning procedure with topological voting, ensuring that each term is assigned to exactly one semantically coherent cluster. The resulting resource enables high-precision semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation, particularly for morphologically rich and low-resource languages where existing synonym databases remain sparse."
