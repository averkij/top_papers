Text:"2026-1-21 Which Reasoning Trajectories Teach Students to Reason Better? Simple Metric of Informative Alignment Yuming Yang1,2, Mingyoung Lai3, Wanxu Zhao1, Xiaoran Fan1, Zhiheng Xi1, Mingqi Wu1, Chiyue Huang4, Jun Zhao1, Haijun Lv2, Jian Tong2, Yunhua Zhou2, Yicheng Zou2,, Qipeng Guo2, Tao Gui1, Qi Zhang1, and Xuanjing Huang1 1Fudan University, 2Shanghai AI Laboratory, 3University of Toronto, 4University of Sydney Long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories provide rich supervision signals for distilling reasoning from teacher to student LLMs. However, both prior work and our experiments show that trajectories from stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, highlighting the importance of datastudent suitability in distillation. Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that closely align with the models current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically combine low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model, balancing learning signal strength and behavioral alignment. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of trajectorys average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training performance (average Spearman 0.86), outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection. 1. Introduction Recent advances in reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) are largely driven by their ability to generate long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories [12, 48]. Beyond enabling complex "

Researchers introduce a novel metric called Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR) to better assess the suitability of reasoning trajectories for distilling knowledge from large language models, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories provide rich supervision signals for distilling reasoning from teacher to student LLMs. However, both prior work and our experiments show that trajectories from stronger teachers do not necessarily yield better students, highlighting the importance of data-student suitability in distillation. Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that closely align with the model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically combine low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model, balancing learning signal strength and behavioral alignment. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training performance (average Spearman 0.86), outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection.

GRADFILTERING is an uncertainty-aware data selection framework for instruction tuning that uses gradient signal-to-noise ratio to improve LLM adaptation efficiency and performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Instruction tuning is a standard paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs), but modern instruction datasets are large, noisy, and redundant, making full-data fine-tuning costly and often unnecessary. Existing data selection methods either build expensive gradient datastores or assign static scores from a weak proxy, largely ignoring evolving uncertainty, and thus missing a key source of LLM interpretability. We propose GRADFILTERING, an objective-agnostic, uncertainty-aware data selection framework that utilizes a small GPT-2 proxy with a LoRA ensemble and aggregates per-example gradients into a Gradient Signal-to-Noise Ratio (G-SNR) utility. Our method matches or surpasses random subsets and strong baselines in most LLM-as-a-judge evaluations as well as in human assessment. Moreover, GRADFILTERING-selected subsets converge faster than competitive filters under the same compute budget, reflecting the benefit of uncertainty-aware scoring.

"GRADFILTERING is an uncertainty-aware data selection framework for instruction tuning that uses gradient signal-to-noise ratio to improve LLM adaptation efficiency and performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Instruction tuning is a standard paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs), but modern instruction datasets are large, noisy, and redundant, making full-data fine-tuning costly and often unnecessary. Existing data selection methods either build expensive gradient datastores or assign static scores from a weak proxy, largely ignoring evolving uncertainty, and thus missing a key source of LLM interpretability. We propose GRADFILTERING, an objective-agnostic, uncertainty-aware data selection framework that utilizes a small GPT-2 proxy with a LoRA ensemble and aggregates per-example gradients into a Gradient Signal-to-Noise Ratio (G-SNR) utility. Our method matches or surpasses random subsets and strong baselines in most LLM-as-a-judge evaluations as well as in human assessment. Moreover, GRADFILTERING-selected subsets converge faster than competitive filters under the same compute budget, reflecting the benefit of uncertainty-aware scoring."

**Justification:**

1. **OPTIMIZATION**: The paper proposes GRADFILTERING, a data selection framework designed to improve training efficiency by selecting high-quality instruction tuning data. This directly addresses optimization of the training process by reducing computational costs and improving convergence speed.

2. **INTERPRETABILITY**: The paper explicitly mentions "a key source of LLM interpretability" and discusses using gradient signals and uncertainty estimation to understand which training examples are most valuable, which relates to analyzing and explaining model behavior.
