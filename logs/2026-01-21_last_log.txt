[ 1 7 3 9 2 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r aMurat Bilgehan Ertan 1 2 Emirhan Boge 3 Min Chen 2 Kaleel Mahmood 4 * Marten van Dijk 1 2 *As large language models (LLMs) are trained on increasingly opaque corpora, membership inference attacks (MIAs) have been proposed to audit whether copyrighted texts were used during training, despite growing concerns about their reliability under realistic conditions. We ask whether MIAs can serve as admissible evidence in adversarial copyright disputes where an accused model developer may obfuscate training data while preserving semantic content, and formalize this setting through judge-prosecutor-accused communication protocol. To test robustness under this protocol, we introduce SAGE (Structure-Aware SAE-Guided Extraction), paraphrasing framework guided by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that rewrites training data to alter lexical structure while preserving semantic content and downstream utility. Our experiments show that stateof-the-art MIAs degrade when models are finetuned on SAGE-generated paraphrases, indicating that their signals are not robust to semanticspreserving transformations. While some leakage remains in certain fine-tuning regimes, these results suggest that MIAs are brittle in adversarial settings and insufficient, on their own, as standalone mechanism for copyright auditing of LLMs. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained and fine-tuned on massive text corpora whose precise composition is rarely disclosed (Longpre et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023), raising concern that training datasets may contain copyrighted material used without permission. These conThese authors contributed equally to this work.*Equally contributed insights, supervision, and responsibility for the successful completion of this work. 1Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), Amsterdam, The Netherlands 2Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands 3Independent Researcher 4University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, United States. Correspondence to: Murat Bilgehan Ertan <bilgehan.ertan@cwi.nl>. Preprint. January 21, 2026. cerns are amplified by evidence that LLMs can memorize and reproduce training data (Carlini et al., 2021; Mireshghallah et al., 2022; Nasr et al., 2025; Ahmed et al., 2026), and by demonstrated vulnerabilities to extraction and inference attacks (Carlini et al., 2021; Chu et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2024). In practice, fine-tuning is widely used in sensitive domains such as medical (Singhal et al., 2023), legal (Guha et al., 2023), financial (Wu et al., 2023), and code-generation (Li et al., 2023) applications, where it often relies on private, regulated, or copyrighted data. As courts begin to confront these issues, central question emerges: what technical evidence, if any, can reliably demonstrate that particular copyrighted work was used to train model? recent U.S. federal ruling highlights the stakes of this question. In Bartz v. Anthropic PBC (2025), the court held that Anthropics use of books for model training did not violate copyright law2. Notably, the decision relied entirely on documentary evidence and company admissions, without considering any technical analysis of model behavior. While such evidence may suffice in cases involving voluntary disclosures, future disputes are likely to arise in settings where factual admissions are absent, adversarial incentives are strong (Henderson et al., 2023), and credible technical evidence would be required to substantiate claims of unauthorized data use. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) (Shokri et al., 2017; Carlini et al., 2021) are natural candidate for providing such technical evidence. Originally developed to detect whether record belonged to the training set of classifier, MIAs for LLMs typically rely on loss reduction, likelihood ratios, or calibration signals (Meeus et al., 2024a; Maini et al., 2024). Prior work has shown that LLMs can be vulnerable to MIAs under certain fine-tuning regimes (Chen et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025). Recent studies reveal substantial limitations: high reported AUCs often arise from temporal or distributional artifacts rather than genuine memorization (Duan et al., 2024; Meeus et al., 2024b; 2025; Maini et al., 2024), and MIAs against pre-training data are largely ineffective because each pre-training sample is typically seen only once (Komatsuzaki, 2019; Kandpal et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2023; Das et al., 2025).

Membership inference attacks fail to reliably detect copyrighted text usage in large language models when training data is paraphrased using structure-aware methods that preserve semantic content.  					AI-generated summary 				 As large language models (LLMs) are trained on increasingly opaque corpora, membership inference attacks (MIAs) have been proposed to audit whether copyrighted texts were used during training, despite growing concerns about their reliability under realistic conditions. We ask whether MIAs can serve as admissible evidence in adversarial copyright disputes where an accused model developer may obfuscate training data while preserving semantic content, and formalize this setting through a judge-prosecutor-accused communication protocol. To test robustness under this protocol, we introduce SAGE (Structure-Aware SAE-Guided Extraction), a paraphrasing framework guided by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that rewrites training data to alter lexical structure while preserving semantic content and downstream utility. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art MIAs degrade when models are fine-tuned on SAGE-generated paraphrases, indicating that their signals are not robust to semantics-preserving transformations. While some leakage remains in certain fine-tuning regimes, these results suggest that MIAs are brittle in adversarial settings and insufficient, on their own, as a standalone mechanism for copyright auditing of LLMs.

Экспериментальные результаты показывают, что современные методы MIA значительно деградируют при работе с данными, обработанными SAGE, что демонстрирует хрупкость этих атак. Исследование подчёркивает, что MIA недостаточны как самостоятельный механизм для аудита авторских прав LLM и могут быть обойдены при семантико-сохраняющих трансформациях текста.",
