Text:"RotBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Identifying Image RotationJaemin Cho Elias Stengel-Eskin Mohit Bansal5 2 0 2 9 1 ] . [ 1 8 6 9 3 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r aWe investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0, 90, 180, and 270. This task demands robust visual reasoning capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these abilities, we introduce ROTBENCH 350image manually-filtered benchmark comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information including captions, depth maps, and more or using chain-ofthought prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0) images, while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180) images. None can reliably distinguish between 90 and 270. Simultaneously showing the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains for reasoning models, while modified setup using voting improves the performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve models ability to distinguish 90 and 270 rotations, despite substantially improving the identification of 180 images. Together, these results reveal significant gap between MLLMs spatial reasoning capabilities and human perception in identifying rotation.Advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have led to increased performance in complex visual tasks, such as image-text retrieval, image segmentation, and visual question 1Code and data: https://github.com/tianyiniu/RotBench 1 Figure 1: We present two ROTBENCH images: one (left) to Gemini-2.5-Pro, the other (right) to GPT-5. Humans can easily identify the correct rotation of the two images, but both models fail to do so. answering (Li et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2023a; Ravi et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2024a; Chen et al., 2023b; Bai et al., 2025; OpenAI, 2025c; Gemini Team, 2025; Liu et al., 2023a; Deitke et al., 2024). However, growing body of recent work suggests that MLLMs are sensitive to simple image transformations (Anis et al., 2025), such as rotations, flips, and blurs, and they fail on tasks that are intuitive to humans (Fu et al., 2024b; Pothiraj et al., 2025; Tong et al., 2024). Downstream tasks involving rotating camera such as robotic arm manipulation or first-person extreme sports analysis require MLLMs to demonstrate robust spatial reasoning, regardless of image orientation. Given these challenges, this work explores fundamental question: can MLLMs identify image orientation? Humans can quickly recognize whether an image has been rotated (Shepard and Metzler, 1971; Vandenberg and Kuse, 1978); for example, it is easy for us to recognize that the left image in Fig. 1 is not upright. The human viewer can use the orientation of the couch in the background to infer that Figure 2: ROTBENCH evaluation pipeline: for each image in ROTBENCH, we rotate the image 0, 90, 180, and 270 counter-clockwise. We represent the rotation estimation problem as multiple-choice question answering problem (Appendix L.5), and separately measure accuracy on each image orientation. We optionally provide different forms of auxiliary information to aid the model in identifying image rotation. We emphasize that all forms of auxiliary information are separately extracted for each rotation; the ground truth rotation is not marked. the father is actually lying on his back rather than standing up. The simple task of identifying image rotation requires reconciling the images subjects, background, and semantics. Here, we show that identifying rotation remains challenge, even in frontier MLLMs. We introduce ROTBENCH (Section 3), benchmark for evaluating MLLMs ability to recognize rotation in images. ROTBENCH consists of images sampled from Spatial-MM (Shiri et al., 2024), and is comprised of two subsets: the 300-image ROTBENCH-LARGE and the 50-image ROTBENCH-SMALL. ROTBENCH is carefully constructed to be challenging but fair, with two-stage filtering procedure to remove images that are indistinguishable under different degrees of rotation. Section 3 describes our dataset construction. Using ROTBENCH, we explore whether frontier MLLMs can identify rotation in input images rotated 0, 90, 180, and 270  (Fig. 2)  . We also evaluate whether providing various forms of auxiliary information or using chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022) prompting improves performance (Section 4.3). We find that models are able to consistently identify right-side-up (0) images. However, only stronger models are able to identify upsidedown (180) images. All models fail to accurately distinguish between 90 and 270 images (Section 6.1, Section 6.2). We find adding auxiliary information offers minimal and inconsistent improvement, often improving performance on 270 images at the expense of 90 images. Leveraging MLLMs tendency to accurately identify 0 images, we attempt to improve performance by further rotating an input image 0, 90, 180, 270 and presenting MLLMs with all rotations simultaneously. Using this approach, reasoning models (o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) show performance improvements, while weaker models see performance degradation. Further extending this idea, we utilize voting approach to algebraically obtain majority vote for the correct ground truth orientation. We obtain model prediction for each further rotation by subtracting the added angle. While this approach does show significant performance improvements on weaker models, it lacks scalability as it requires multiple model calls for each prediction, and assumes priori knowledge of all possible orientations (Appendix I). Finally, fine-tuning on out-of-domain data (Section 6.3) significantly improved performance on identifying 180 images but not 90 and 270. Interestingly, we find an oscillating pattern of performance changes between 90 and 270 as training progresses. Any performance improvement in 90 is matched with degradation of 270 and vice versa. These results suggest the presence of two local optima hindering across-the-board progress. Our finding"

MLLMs struggle to accurately identify image rotations, particularly 90° and 270°, despite improvements with auxiliary information and fine-tuning.  					AI-generated summary 				 We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg}, 180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information -- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images, while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and human perception in identifying rotation.
