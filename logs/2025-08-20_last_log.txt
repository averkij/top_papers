Text:"Embodied-R1: Reinforced Embodied Reasoning for General Robotic Manipulation Yifu Yuan Haiqin Cui Yaoting Huang Yibin Chen Fei Ni Zibin Dong Pengyi Li Jianye Hao Yan Zheng Tianjin University 5 2 0 2 9 1 ] . [ 1 8 9 9 3 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the seeing-to-doing gap, stemming from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we pioneer pointing as unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. Then we train Embodied-R1 using two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.

This potential has been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across wide range of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we propose zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and multi-objective optimization respectively.

Text:"Beyond Human Judgment: Bayesian Evaluation of LLMs Moral Values Understanding5 2 0 2 9 1 ] . [ 1 4 0 8 3 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r aHow do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans? This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth (majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty (model domain sensitivity). We evaluated the best language models (Claude Sonnet 4, DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from 700 annotators in 100K+ texts spanning social networks, news and forums. Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing that AI models typically rank among the top 25% of human annotators, achieving much better than average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more sensitive moral detection capabilities. Keywords: moral reasoning, large language models, uncertainty quantification, natural language processing, soft labels modellingMoral Foundations Theory (MFT) provides comprehensive framework for understanding human moral reasoning across cultures, identifying core dimensions typically expressed as virtue/vice pairs: Care vs. Harm, Fairness vs. Cheating, Loyalty vs. Betrayal, Authority vs. Subversion, and Sanctity vs. Degradation (Graham et al., 2013; Haidt, 2012). These foundations shape individual and collective decision-making, from political preferences to social behavior (Feinberg and Willer, 2013; Graham et al., 2009; Roy and Goldwasser, 2021; Nguyen et al., 2022), making their computational detection 1 crucial for understanding discourse dynamics and developing ethically-aligned AI systems."My heart breaks seeing children separated from families at the border" "Everyone deserves equal access to healthcare regardless of income" "Respect your elders and follow traditional values that built this nation" "Stand with our troops - they sacrifice everything for our freedom" "Marriage is sacred and should be protected from secular corruption"Table 1: Posts and Associated Moral Foundation The computational linguistics community has successfully fine-tuned pre-trained language models to predict moral values (Nguyen et al., 2024; Zangari et al., 2025a; Preniqi et al., 2024), achieving good alignment with human judgment when domain similarity and sufficient training data are available. However, systematic evaluation of large language models (LLMs) remains limited despite their rapid advances and potential as compelling alternative that should suffer less from poor generalization and distribution shift. This paper addresses these limitations through rigorous large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art language models across established moral reasoning corpora, employing Bayesian methods to resolve disagreeing annotations.Bayesian uncertainty modelling of moral annotations We introduce Bayesian modelling of annotator disagreements for moral foundation evaluation, moving beyond deterministic ground-truth assumptions. This captures both aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty (model sensitivity across domains and foundations). Large-scale evaluation. We analyse marketleading large language models with 1M+ queries across 100K+ texts and 250K+ annotations from diverse sources, providing the most comprehensive moral reasoning evaluation to date. Statistical analysis of Type I/II errors. We demonstrate that AI performs comparably to top annotators in balanced accuracy, considerably improving false negatives at the price of slightly increased false positive rates - contrary to fears that AI underpredicts moral values. Novel GPU-optimized implementation of Bayesian labels. We developed TensorFlow framework using sparse operations for scalable Bayesian inference, valuable resource for the computational linguistics community."

A pointing-centric representation and reinforced fine-tuning approach improve embodied AI generalization across various tasks and visual disturbances.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.

MedSAMix, a training-free model merging method, combines generalist and specialist models to improve medical image segmentation performance across diverse tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Universal medical image segmentation models have emerged as a promising paradigm due to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks, showing great potential for a wide range of clinical applications. This potential has been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we propose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and multi-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias and consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and generalization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37% on multi-task evaluations.

This potential has been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we propose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and multi-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias and consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and generalization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37% on multi-task evaluations."

A Bayesian evaluation framework assesses large language models' moral understanding by modeling human annotator disagreements, showing AI models perform well with fewer false negatives.  					AI-generated summary 				 How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?   This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth (majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty (model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4, DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on 100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.   Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more sensitive moral detection capabilities.
