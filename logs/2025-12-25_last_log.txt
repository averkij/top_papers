To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (10012024), GPS data, and page-view counts as proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, Equal contribution. memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities. Project page: https://sytwu.github. io/BeyondMemo/ 1. Introduction The construction year of building is essential for sustainability audits, heritage preservation, and post-disaster assessment. Yet, unlike style or material, the age of most of the worlds 1.5 trillion mapped buildings is unknown. Automated building age estimation could support continent-scale retrofitting and fine-grained historical queries, but progress is hindered by the lack of global, large-scale, open benchmark. Figure 1 previews YearGuessr, our answer to this gap. As shown in Table 1, existing datasets are either geographically narrow or temporally shallow. MyCD dataset [14] covers only Western Europe with coarse epochs (<1930, 1 Table 1. Building-age datasets. Earlier datasets are either regional, post-1900, have no images, or are closed source. Our YEARGUESSR will be the first CC BY-SA 4.0 image set with continuous labels, global (157 countries) coverage, and 10012024 CE span.

Prior works also cast age prediction as classification, ignoring temporal ordinality, while licensing restrictions impede reproducibility. Beyond data gaps, fundamental question remains: do vision-language models (VLMs) truly learn architecture, or simply memorize landmarks? We show that VLMs like Gemini-2.0 gain +34.18% accuracy on high-popularity buildings, whereas other general models degrade (Section 5). It depicts the evidence of popularity memorization rather than genuine architectural understanding. To address these issues, we present YearGuessr, the first open benchmark for building-age estimation with 55,546 images across 157 countries, spanning 10012024 CE in Figure 1(a) and (b), along with our proposed model, YearCLIP. Each entry includes facades, GPS, captions, and Wikipedia page views to probe memorization bias. We frame the task as ordinal regression and evaluate with MAE, Interval Accuracy, and new popularity-aware metric, demonstrating that VLMs performance might stem from memorization rather than architectural understanding potentially. Our YearCLIP (Section 4) is CLIP-based model that integrates ordinal training using coarse-to-fine strategy from NumCLIP [16], and GPS priors via fused location encoder with zero-convolution. It is also notably enhanced with several pre-defined reasoning prompts (e.g., Roof (spire, dome), Wall (brick, stone)) that enrich the feature space. This allows the model to provide human-verifiable rationales by highlighting the most relevant architectural cues, adding crucial layer of explainability to its final year prediction. Our contributions are: YearGuessr dataset: will be the first open, CC BY-SA 4.0 corpus with global coverage, large-scale ordinal labels, GPS, and rich textual descriptions. YearCLIP model: We propose YearCLIP, our baseline model, which is enhanced with reasoning prompts to provide explainability for the age prediction task. Evaluation protocol: an original regression benchmark with Interval Accuracy and new popularity-based MAE metric to quantify memorization bias. Baseline: We provide comprehensive benchmark study of 30+ CNN-, Transformer-, CLIP-based, and LLM/VLM models. Insights: We reveal that VLMs memorize popular landmarks, achieving dramatically different performance based on building fame rather than architectural features. 2. Related Work Datasets for building-age estimation. Prior corpora remain limited in scope. Building Age Estimation [14] fuses multiple modalities but covers only Western Europe and coarse epochs. CMAB adds Chinese façades yet spans 19852018 [79]. MTBF-33 lists U.S. footprints without imagery [60]. Other efforts are small-scale (131 London photos [74]) or style-focused (WikiChurches [5]). Early work on architectural style recognition [4042] and heritage analysis [38] established foundations for visual classification. Broader surveys [17] situate AI in preservation. Earlier datasets often rely on real-estate photos or GIS metadata [8, 32, 57]. In contrast, YEARGUE"

The "one-shot" technique represents a distinct and sophisticated aesthetic in filmmaking. However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, empowering users to transform fragmented visual materials into vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences.

Recent advances in pretraining general foundation models have significantly improved performance across diverse downstream tasks. While autoregressive (AR) generative models like GPT have revolutionized NLP, most visual generative pretraining methods still rely on BERT-style masked modeling, which often disregards the temporal information essential for video analysis. The few existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods suffer from issues such as inaccurate semantic localization and poor generation quality, leading to poor semantics. In this work, we propose NExT-Vid, a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework that utilizes masked next-frame prediction to jointly model images and videos. NExT-Vid introduces a context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from target decoding, and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to enhance generation quality and diversity. Through context-isolated flow-matching pretraining, our approach achieves strong representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale pretrained models demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms previous generative pretraining methods for visual representation learning via attentive probing in downstream classification.

Through context-isolated flow-matching pretraining, our approach achieves strong representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale pretrained models demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms previous generative pretraining methods for visual representation learning via attentive probing in downstream classification."

Tokenizers provide the fundamental basis through which text is represented and processed by language models (LMs). Despite the importance of tokenization, its role in LM performance and behavior is poorly understood due to the challenge of measuring the impact of tokenization in isolation. To address this need, we present TokSuite, a collection of models and a benchmark that supports research into tokenization's influence on LMs. Specifically, we train fourteen models that use different tokenizers but are otherwise identical using the same architecture, dataset, training budget, and initialization. Additionally, we curate and release a new benchmark that specifically measures model performance subject to real-world perturbations that are likely to influence tokenization. Together, TokSuite allows robust decoupling of the influence of a model's tokenizer, supporting a series of novel findings that elucidate the respective benefits and shortcomings of a wide range of popular tokenizers.
