Text:"5 2 0 2 6 ] . [ 1 6 0 3 4 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r ScoreFlow: Mastering LLM Agent Workflows via Score-based Preference Optimization Yinjie Wang1,* Ling Yang2,* Guohao Li3 Mengdi Wang2 Bryon Aragam Project: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/ScoreFlowRecent research has leveraged large language model multi-agent systems for complex problemsolving while trying to reduce the manual effort required to build them, driving the development of automated agent workflow optimization methods. However, existing methods remain inflexible due to representational limitations, lack of adaptability, and poor scalability when relying on discrete optimization techniques. We address these challenges with ScoreFlow, simple yet highperformance framework that leverages efficient gradient-based optimization in continuous space. ScoreFlow incorporates Score-DPO, novel variant of the direct preference optimization method that accounts for quantitative feedback. Across six benchmarks spanning question answering, coding, and mathematical reasoning, ScoreFlow achieves an 8.2% improvement over existing baselines. Moreover, it empowers smaller models to outperform larger ones with lower inference costs.Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in solving natural language tasks [25, 33, 1, 2, 41, 42]. Furthermore, the multiagent system (workflow) of LLMs, where multiple agents coordinate and exchange information to complete tasks, enables LLM-based agents to collaborate and solve complex tasks across wide range of domains, such as mathematical problem solving [47, 38], question answering [24], and coding tasks [12, 28]. These manually designed agentic workflows, however, require significant effort and have limited capacity to handle tasks across diverse domains. Therefore, the emerging focus in this area is to address the limitations of static workflows by developing automated methods for workflow generation and optimization. These optimizations can target various aspects, including prompt refinement, hyperparameter tuning, and workflow structure design [17, 49, 44, 14, 46, 7, 19, 21, 32, 45]. The automated optimization methods can be constrained by the limitations inherent in pre-defined workflow structures and the rigidity of workflow space representations [17, 49, 44, 21]. DyLAN [21] thoughtfully emphasizes the communication structure within LLM debates but overlooks other potential communication structures. GPTSwarm [49] leverages graph-based structures and employs reinforcement fine-tuning for optimization. However, the lack of consideration for conditional states within the graph structure imposes restrictions on the search space. To improve representation capabilities, AFlow [46] and ADAS [14] employ code as representation for workflow, facilitating robust and flexible workflow searches. However, ADAS faces challenges with inefficient search processes and coarse workflow storage, which leads to the accumulation of irrelevant data and increased complexity, ultimately reducing its effectiveness. To address these issues, AFlow employs variant of the Monte Carlo Tree Search as an optimization method to enhance efficiency. However, the overly rapid convergence on workflow structures, combined with the discrete optimization method, restricts the exploration of the search space, often leading to suboptimal outcomes. Additionally, they all optimize single workflow for the entire task set, which limits adaptability and scalability for larger datasets containing diverse problems [45, 32]. To address these challenges, we propose ScoreFlow, an automated and cost-efficient multi-agent workflow generation framework that employs novel optimization method to achieve high performance, scalability, and adaptability. For each given task, the workflow generator constructs its workflow using code as representation and the generator is further optimized based on evaluation scores feedback. *Equal contribution. 1University of Chicago. 2Princeton University. 3University of Oxford. Correspondence to: yangling0818@163.com, yinjie@uchicago.edu. 1 The loss-gradient optimization makes it more flexible and scalable than previous discrete optimization methods [46, 14, 21]. Furthermore, by leveraging an open-source LLM as the foundational model for workflow generation, our framework minimizes the costs associated with workflow generation. This approach addresses the challenge of high API call expenses inherent in the workflow generation process [14, 32]. In the optimization process, we collect preference pairs from evaluation scores to construct preference data, which are subsequently used to fine-tune the workflow generator via novel variant of direct preference optimization (DPO) [27]. While DPO is efficient and stable, variance and inaccuracies in evaluation scores reduce the reliability of preference data, slowing convergence and hindering optimal performance within limited iterations. To address these limitations, we propose widely applicable preference optimization method, Score-DPO, which incorporates quantitative score information directly into the optimization process. We highlight our following contributions: ScoreFlow: We introduce ScoreFlow, simple yet flexible, automated, and adaptive framework for agentic workflow generation and optimization, minimizing the need for human intervention. Score-DPO: We propose Score-DPO, an optimization method that can be broadly applied in similar settings, leveraging quantitative evaluation feedback rather than relying solely on preference pairs by integrating evaluation scores into the preference optimization process. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through both experimental results and theoretical analysis. Extensive Evaluations: We evaluate ScoreFlow with Score-DPO on six benchmark datasets across three diverse tasks: question answering, coding, and mathematical reasoning. Our approach outperforms baseline methods by 8.2%. Extensive studies further highlight the robustness, scalability, and cost-efficiency of ScoreFlow across different models and reveal its ability to enable smaller models to surpass larger models in performance while achieving greater cost efficiency.Automated Optimizations for Prompt and Hyperparameter Automated optimization methods emphasizing prompt optimization [11, 44, 40, 17] or hyperparameter optimization [29] can enhance performance; however, they impose limitations on the workflow structure and often require manual modifications to accommodate new tasks,"

However, the key to taming LLMs on complex instructions remains mysterious, for that there are huge gaps between models trained by open-source community and those trained by leading companies. To bridge the gap, we propose simple and scalable approach ULTRAIF for building LLMs that can follow complex instructions with open-source data. ULTRAIF first decomposes real-world user prompts into simpler queries, constraints, and corresponding evaluation questions for the constraints. Then, we train an UltraComposer to compose constraint-associated prompts with evaluation questions. This prompt composer allows us to synthesize complicated instructions as well as filter responses with evaluation questions. In our experiment, for the first time, we successfully align LLaMA-3.1-8B-Base to catch up with its instruct version on 5 instructionfollowing benchmarks without any benchmark information, using only 8B model as response generator and evaluator. The aligned model also achieved competitive scores on other benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that ULTRAIF could further improve LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct through self-alignment, motivating broader use cases for the method.

Introduction Large language models (Meta, 2024; OpenAI, 2024) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, especially in following complex instructions. While modeling such ability is crucial, the technical details and the instruction datasets used in state-of-the-art LLMs remain mysterious. For example, LLaMA3 (Meta, 2024) reportedly leverages instructionfollowing data at the tens of millions scale but has not been *Equal contribution 1Shanghai AI Lab 2Peking University 3Tsinghua University. Correspondence to: Ganqu Cui <cuiganqu@pjlab.org.cn>, Baobao Chang <chbb@pku.edu.cn>. Figure 1. Instruction-following performance comparison of ULTRAIF against baselines on IFEval and MultiIF. open-sourced. This lack of transparency has resulted in significant gap between the research community and the leading companies. Recent efforts in aligning LLMs to follow instructions have focused on creating high-quality instruction-following data. On the one hand, Wei et al. (2021); Rajani et al. (2023); Jiang et al. (2023) involve human annotators in developing instructions and manually crafting corresponding responses. While effective, these methods are label-intensive, heavily reliant on human expertise, and face challenges in scalability and cost efficiency. On the other hand, Xu et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023); Sun et al. (2024a); Dong et al. (2024) attempt to leverage LLMs to automatically construct highquality instruction data. Specifically, Xu et al. (2023); Sun et al. (2024a) guide LLMs to generate constraints and evolve initial instructions into more complex forms. However, these LLMs-driven methods heavily rely on models instructionevolving capability and overemphasize instruction complexity, ultimately hindering the diversity of evolved instructions and the correctness of generated responses. To improve this, Wang et al. (2023); Dong et al. (2024) introduce handcrafted constraints inspired by human priors to guide LLMs. For instance, Dong et al. (2024) introduces constraints that can be verified by code execution to ensure response correctness. However, these handcrafted constraints introduce rigidity, 1 ULTRAIF leading to homogeneous instructions and making it narrow in encompassing more complex or diverse instructions (e.g., write in Shakespeares tone). As result, scaling such instruction with correct responses remains significant challenge, limiting the applicability of modeling the distribution of instructions from real-world users. In this paper, we propose ULTRAIF, simple and scalable method which synthesizes high-quality instructionfollowing data. The core idea of ULTRAIF is to decompose real-world user instructions for both constraints and evaluation questions, then train composer model to synthesize diverse and complex instructions with verification questions. To achieve this, we first utilize LLM to decompose human instructions into simplified instructions and their associated constraints. For each constraint, the LLM further generates the corresponding evaluation question to verify whether the upcoming response meets the requirement. With these components, we train UltraComposer, which takes the simplified instruction as input and outputs the original instruction along with its evaluation question. In this way, the composer learns to evolve instructions with verifiable constraints, and benefits from the generalization ability of LLMs rather than handcrafted rules. With the composer, ULTRAIF could make any instruction more complicated to synthesize large-scale and diverse dataset. The evaluation questions further help with quality control in rejection sampling and preference learning (Rafailov et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that ULTRAIF significantly enhances the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs with high scalability and cost efficiency. Our evaluation, conducted on the LLaMA-3.1-8B model across five instruction-following datasets, confirms ULTRAIFs strong alignment with general instructions. Notably, as shown in Figure 1, by scaling up the training data, we achieve milestone, optimizing the LLaMA-3.1-8BBase model to match the instruction-following ability of its instruct version. Additionally, we assess the generability of ULTRAIF by evaluating it on mathematical, reasoning, coding, and general conversation domains. Furthermore, we explore the potential of self-alignment in ULTRAIF by further optimizing the LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct model, and achieve substantial improvement. The main contributions of our paper are as follows: We introduce ULTRAIF, simple and scalable approach that leverages real-world user instructions to train composer model, UltraComposer, enabling the synthesis of complex and diverse instructions with correct responses. Our experiments demonstrate the strong performance of ULTRAIF in handling complex instructions, surpassing all baselines under the same data budget while retaining general capabilities in domain"

ScoreFlow incorporates Score-DPO, a novel variant of the direct preference optimization method that accounts for quantitative feedback. Across six benchmarks spanning question answering, coding, and mathematical reasoning, ScoreFlow achieves an 8.2% improvement over existing baselines. Moreover, it empowers smaller models to outperform larger ones with lower inference costs. Project: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/ScoreFlow"

Instruction-following made modern large language models (LLMs) helpful assistants. However, the key to taming LLMs on complex instructions remains mysterious, for that there are huge gaps between models trained by open-source community and those trained by leading companies. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple and scalable approach UltraIF for building LLMs that can follow complex instructions with open-source data. UltraIF first decomposes real-world user prompts into simpler queries, constraints, and corresponding evaluation questions for the constraints. Then, we train an UltraComposer to compose constraint-associated prompts with evaluation questions. This prompt composer allows us to synthesize complicated instructions as well as filter responses with evaluation questions. In our experiment, for the first time, we successfully align LLaMA-3.1-8B-Base to catch up with its instruct version on 5 instruction-following benchmarks without any benchmark information, using only 8B model as response generator and evaluator. The aligned model also achieved competitive scores on other benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that UltraIF could further improve LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct through self-alignment, motivating broader use cases for the method. Our code will be available at https://github.com/kkk-an/UltraIF.

Large language models (LLMs), such as o1 from OpenAI, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities. o1 generates a long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) before answering a question. LongCoT allows LLMs to analyze problems, devise plans, reflect, and backtrack effectively. These actions empower LLM to solve complex problems. After the release of o1, many teams have attempted to replicate its LongCoT and reasoning capabilities. In terms of methods, they primarily rely on knowledge distillation with data from existing models with LongCoT capacities (e.g., OpenAI-o1, Qwen-QwQ, DeepSeek-R1-Preview), leaving significant uncertainties on systematically developing such reasoning abilities. In terms of data domains, these works focus narrowly on math while a few others include coding, limiting their generalizability. This paper introduces a novel approach to enable LLM's LongCoT capacity without distillation from o1-like models or expensive human annotations, where we bootstrap LongCoT (BOLT) from a standard instruct model. BOLT involves three stages: 1) LongCoT data bootstrapping with in-context learning on a standard instruct model; 2) LongCoT supervised finetuning; 3) online training to further refine LongCoT capacities. In BOLT, only a few in-context examples need to be constructed during the bootstrapping stage; in our experiments, we created 10 examples, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. We use Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct to bootstrap LongCoT and apply our method to various model scales (7B, 8B, 70B). We achieve impressive performance on a variety of benchmarks, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench, WildBench, ZebraLogic, MATH500, which evaluate diverse task-solving and reasoning capabilities.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant capability across various tasks, with their real-world effectiveness often driven by prompt design. While recent research has focused on optimizing prompt content, the role of prompt formatting, a critical but often overlooked dimension, has received limited systematic investigation. In this paper, we introduce Content-Format Integrated Prompt Optimization (CFPO), an innovative methodology that jointly optimizes both prompt content and formatting through an iterative refinement process. CFPO leverages natural language mutations to explore content variations and employs a dynamic format exploration strategy that systematically evaluates diverse format options. Our extensive evaluations across multiple tasks and open-source LLMs demonstrate that CFPO demonstrates measurable performance improvements compared to content-only optimization methods. This highlights the importance of integrated content-format optimization and offers a practical, model-agnostic approach to enhancing LLM performance. Code will be available at https://github.com/HenryLau7/CFPO.

"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant capability across various tasks, with their real-world effectiveness often driven by prompt design. While recent research has focused on optimizing prompt content, the role of prompt formatting, a critical but often overlooked dimension, has received limited systematic investigation. In this paper, we introduce Content-Format Integrated Prompt Optimization (CFPO), an innovative methodology that jointly optimizes both prompt content and formatting through an iterative refinement process. CFPO leverages natural language mutations to explore content variations and employs a dynamic format exploration strategy that systematically evaluates diverse format options. Our extensive evaluations across multiple tasks and open-source LLMs demonstrate that CFPO demonstrates measurable performance improvements compared to content-only optimization methods. This highlights the importance of integrated content-format optimization and offers a practical, model-agnostic approach to enhancing LLM performance. Code will be available at https://github.com/HenryLau7/CFPO."

We propose Heterogeneous Masked Autoregression (HMA) for modeling action-video dynamics to generate high-quality data and evaluation in scaling robot learning. Building interactive video world models and policies for robotics is difficult due to the challenge of handling diverse settings while maintaining computational efficiency to run in real time. HMA uses heterogeneous pre-training from observations and action sequences across different robotic embodiments, domains, and tasks. HMA uses masked autoregression to generate quantized or soft tokens for video predictions. \ourshort achieves better visual fidelity and controllability than the previous robotic video generation models with 15 times faster speed in the real world. After post-training, this model can be used as a video simulator from low-level action inputs for evaluating policies and generating synthetic data. See this link https://liruiw.github.io/hma for more information.
