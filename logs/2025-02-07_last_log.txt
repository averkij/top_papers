Text:"Weak-to-Strong Diffusion with Reflection Lichen Bai 1 Masashi Sugiyama 2 3 Zeke Xie 1 5 2 0 2 5 ] . [ 2 3 7 4 0 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aThe goal of diffusion generative models is to align the learned distribution with the real data distribution through gradient score matching. However, inherent limitations in training data quality, modeling strategies, and architectural design lead to inevitable gap between generated outputs and real data. To reduce this gap, we propose Weak-toStrong Diffusion (W2SD), novel framework that utilizes the estimated difference between existing weak and strong models (i.e., weak-to-strong difference) to approximate the gap between an ideal model and strong model. By employing reflective operation that alternates between denoising and inversion with weak-to-strong difference, we theoretically understand that W2SD steers latent variables along sampling trajectories toward regions of the real data distribution. W2SD is highly flexible and broadly applicable, enabling diverse improvements through the strategic selection of weak-to-strong model pairs (e.g., DreamShaper vs. SD1.5, good experts vs. bad experts in MoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that W2SD significantly improves human preference, aesthetic quality, and prompt adherence, achieving SOTA performance across various modalities (e.g., image, video), architectures (e.g., UNet-based, DiT-based, MoE), and benchmarks. For example, Juggernaut-XL with W2SD can improve with the HPSv2 winning rate up to 90% over the original results. Moreover, the performance gains achieved by W2SD markedly outweigh its additional computational overhead, while the cumulative improvements from different weak-to-strong difference further solidify its practical utility and deployability. The code is publicly available at github.com/xie-lab-ml//Weak-toStrong-Diffusion-with-Reflection. 1xLeaF Lab, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) 2RIKEN AIP 3The University of Tokyo. Correspondence to: Zeke Xie <zekexie@hkust-gz.edu.cn>. 1 Figure 1. W2SD leverages the gap between weak and strong models to approximate the gap between strong and ideal models. 1. Introduction In probabilistic modeling, the estimated density represents model-predicted distributions while the ground truth density reflects actual data distributions. Diffusion models (Song et al.), known for its powerful generative capabilities and diversity, estimate the gradient of the probability density in perturbed data distributions by optimizing score-based network, which has become mainstream paradigm in many generative tasks (Podell et al.; Guo et al., 2023). To enhance the alignment between the learned and real data distributions in diffusion models, extensive research has focused on improving the gradient alignment between estimated and ground truth densities through various strategies (Karras et al., 2022; Song & Ermon, 2020; Ho et al., 2022). However, constrained by practical limitations including architectural design and dataset quality issues, existing diffusion models inevitably exhibit gradient estimation errors, leading to gap between the learned and real data distributions. Depending on the magnitude of this gap, we can classify them as either strong or weak diffusion models. Specifically, due to the inaccessibility of the real data distribution, we cannot establish direct methodologies to measure this gap and effectively reduce it. In this work, we demonstrate that the gap between the strong and weak models can be used to empirically approximate the gap between the ideal and strong models. In Figure 1, we propose to use the estimated weak-to-strong difference 1 to approximate the inaccessible strong-to-ideal difference 2, thereby enhancing the strong model toward the ideal Weak-to-Strong Diffusion with Reflection Figure 2. The qualitative results of W2SD demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various aspects, such as text rendering, position, color, counting, and object co-occurrence. We present more cases in Appendix C.2. model. We note this weak-to-strong concept has been widely applied in training processes of machine learning, with early instances such as AdaBoost (Schapire, 2013), where the ensembling of weak models enhances the performance of strong models. Also, Burns et al. (2023) have demonstrated that weak models can serve as supervisory signals to assist in the alignment during the training of large LLMs. To empirically estimate the weak-to-strong difference, we draw upon reflective mechanisms, the process of modifying generated outputs based on prior states, which have been extensively studied in the field of LLMs (Gou et al.; Madaan et al., 2024; Shinn et al., 2024). Specifically, we propose Weak-to-Strong Diffusion (W2SD), novel framework that leverages weak-to-strong difference to approximate the strong-to-ideal difference. By incorporating reflective operation that alternates between denoising and inversion based on the weak-to-strong difference, we theoretically understand in Section 3.1 that W2SD guides latent variables along sampling trajectories, effectively steering them toward regions of the real data distribution. And we provide qualitative results in Figure We emphasize that W2SD can be generalized to diverse application scenarios. Notably, in Appendix E.2 we demonstrate existing inference enhancement methods including Re-Sampling (lug, 2022), Z-Sampling (Bai et al., 2024), FreeDom (Yu et al., 2023) and TFG (Ye et al., 2024) can be reinterpreted as specialized instances of W2SD. Users can define weak-to-strong model pairs based on their specific needs. Depending on the type of the model pair (e.g., DreamShaper vs. SD1.5, good experts vs. bad experts in MoE), different effects of improvements can be achieved. We provide further application analysis in Section 4 to demonstrate the broad applicability of W2SD. The contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we introduce the weak-to-strong concept into the inference enhancement of diffusion models, demonstrating that the difference of estimated densities between weak and strong diffusion models can approximate the difference between strong and ideal models, consequently bridging the gap between the learned and real data distribution. Second, to estimate the weak-to-strong difference, we propose novel inference framework called W2SD, with theoretical understanding that implicitly estimates the weakto-strong difference through iterative reflection, effe"

The goal of diffusion generative models is to align the learned distribution with the real data distribution through gradient score matching. However, inherent limitations in training data quality, modeling strategies, and architectural design lead to inevitable gap between generated outputs and real data. To reduce this gap, we propose Weak-to-Strong Diffusion (W2SD), a novel framework that utilizes the estimated difference between existing weak and strong models (i.e., weak-to-strong difference) to approximate the gap between an ideal model and a strong model. By employing a reflective operation that alternates between denoising and inversion with weak-to-strong difference, we theoretically understand that W2SD steers latent variables along sampling trajectories toward regions of the real data distribution. W2SD is highly flexible and broadly applicable, enabling diverse improvements through the strategic selection of weak-to-strong model pairs (e.g., DreamShaper vs. SD1.5, good experts vs. bad experts in MoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that W2SD significantly improves human preference, aesthetic quality, and prompt adherence, achieving SOTA performance across various modalities (e.g., image, video), architectures (e.g., UNet-based, DiT-based, MoE), and benchmarks. For example, Juggernaut-XL with W2SD can improve with the HPSv2 winning rate up to 90% over the original results. Moreover, the performance gains achieved by W2SD markedly outweigh its additional computational overhead, while the cumulative improvements from different weak-to-strong difference further solidify its practical utility and deployability.
