Text:"Enhancing Code Generation for Low-Resource Languages: No Silver Bullet Alessandro Giagnorio, Alberto Martin-Lopez, Gabriele Bavota Software Institute USI Universit`a della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland 5 2 0 2 1 3 ] . [ 1 5 8 0 9 1 . 1 0 5 2 : r AbstractThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has signiﬁcantly advanced the ﬁeld of automated code generation. LLMs rely on large and diverse datasets to learn syntax, semantics, and usage patterns of programming languages. For low-resource languages (i.e., niche programming languages characterized by the scarcity of training data), the limited availability of such data hampers the models ability to generalize effectively, resulting in poorer code generation performance as compared to high-resource languages. For this reason, there is quest for techniques able to close this performance gap. We present an empirical study investigating the effectiveness of several approaches for boosting LLMs performance on low-resource languages, namely: (i) classic ﬁne-tuning, which is however capped in size by the scarcity of training data; (ii) three variants of in-context learning, with prompts crafted to provide the LLM with additional information about the low-resource language (e.g., few-shot examples showcasing features of the targeted language); and (iii) pre-training objective teaching the model how to translate between highand low-resource languages. The context of our study are two low-resource languages (R and Racket) and six LLMs having different architectures and sizes. Our ﬁndings reveal that ﬁne-tuning is usually the best choice for smaller LLMs, possibly due to the fact that even small dataset is sufﬁcient to train their limited number of parameters. With the increase in size of the models, in-context learning becomes more and more effective, representing safe and cheap bet (i.e., it always helps, but with different magnitudes). Differently, very large LLMs may deteriorate their performance on low-resource languages wh"

Text:"PlotGen: Multi-Agent LLM-based Scientific Data Visualization via Multimodal Feedback Kanika Goswami IGDTUW, Delhi India 5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 8 8 9 0 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract Scientific data visualization is pivotal for transforming raw data into comprehensible visual representations, enabling pattern recognition, forecasting, and the presentation of data-driven insights. However, novice users often face difficulties due to the complexity of selecting appropriate tools and mastering visualization techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated potential in assisting code generation, though they struggle with accuracy and require iterative debugging. In this paper, we propose PlotGen, novel multi-agent framework aimed at automating the creation of precise scientific visualizations. PlotGen orchestrates multiple LLM-based agents, including: (1) Query Planning Agent that breaks down complex user requests into executable steps; (2) Code Generation Agent that converts pseudocode into executable Python code; and three retrieval feedback agents(3) Numeric Feedback Agent, (4) Lexical Feedback Agent, and (5) Visual Feedback Agentthat leverage multimodal LLMs to iteratively refine the data accuracy, textual labels, and visual correctness of generated plots via self-reflection. Extensive experiments show that PlotGen outperforms strong baselines, achieving 4-6% improvement on the MatPlotBench dataset, leading to enhanced user trust in LLMgenerated visualizations and improved novice productivity due to reduction in debugging time needed for plot errors.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the field of automated code generation. LLMs rely on large and diverse datasets to learn syntax, semantics, and usage patterns of programming languages. For low-resource languages (i.e., niche programming languages characterized by the scarcity of training data), the limited availability of such data hampers the models' ability to generalize effectively, resulting in poorer code generation performance as compared to high-resource languages. For this reason, there is a quest for techniques able to close this performance gap. We present an empirical study investigating the effectiveness of several approaches for boosting LLMs' performance on low-resource languages, namely: (i) a classic fine-tuning, which is however capped in size by the scarcity of training data; (ii) three variants of in-context learning, with prompts crafted to provide the LLM with additional information about the low-resource language (e.g., few-shot examples showcasing features of the targeted language); and (iii) a pre-training objective teaching the model how to translate between high- and low-resource languages. The context of our study are two low-resource languages (R and Racket) and six LLMs having different architectures and sizes. Our findings reveal that a fine-tuning is usually the best choice for smaller LLMs, possibly due to the fact that even a small dataset is sufficient to train their limited number of parameters. With the increase in size of the models, in-context learning becomes more and more effective, representing a safe and cheap bet (i.e., it always helps, but with different magnitudes). Differently, very large LLMs may deteriorate their performance on low-resource languages when fine-tuning is performed, possibly due to the lack of enough data needed to effectively update their weights.

Scientific data visualization is pivotal for transforming raw data into comprehensible visual representations, enabling pattern recognition, forecasting, and the presentation of data-driven insights. However, novice users often face difficulties due to the complexity of selecting appropriate tools and mastering visualization techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated potential in assisting code generation, though they struggle with accuracy and require iterative debugging. In this paper, we propose PlotGen, a novel multi-agent framework aimed at automating the creation of precise scientific visualizations. PlotGen orchestrates multiple LLM-based agents, including a Query Planning Agent that breaks down complex user requests into executable steps, a Code Generation Agent that converts pseudocode into executable Python code, and three retrieval feedback agents - a Numeric Feedback Agent, a Lexical Feedback Agent, and a Visual Feedback Agent - that leverage multimodal LLMs to iteratively refine the data accuracy, textual labels, and visual correctness of generated plots via self-reflection. Extensive experiments show that PlotGen outperforms strong baselines, achieving a 4-6 percent improvement on the MatPlotBench dataset, leading to enhanced user trust in LLM-generated visualizations and improved novice productivity due to a reduction in debugging time needed for plot errors.
