While some open-source alternatives have emerged, there is still notable lag behind specialized singlemodality models in performance. In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal language model that achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio understanding compared to specialized counterparts. The core design of Ola lies in its progressive modality alignment strategy that extends the supporting modality of the language model progressively. Our training pipeline begins with the most distinct modalities: image and text, then gradually expands the skill sets of the model using speech data that connects language and audio knowledge, and video data that connects all modalities. The progressive learning pipeline also enables us to maintain relatively small size of the cross-modal * Equal Contribution. Corresponding authors. alignment data, making developing omni-modal from existing vision-language models easy and less costly. Moreover, to unlock an advanced interactive experience like GPT-4o, we further design sentence-wise decoding solution for streaming speech generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola surpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models of similar sizes. We aim to make Ola fully open omni-modal understanding solution to advance future research in this emerging field. Model weights, code, and data are opensourced at https://github.com/Ola-Omni/Ola. 1. Introduction Multi-Modal Large Language Models are drawing increasing attention owing to their strong instruction-following capabilities and abundant knowledge of handling complex inputs including texts, images, videos, and audio. Based on the strong performance of open-sourced large language models [56, 76], Figure 2. Ola Architecture. Ola supports omni-modal inputs including text, image, video, and audio, capable of processing the inputs simultaneously with competitive performance on understanding tasks for all these modalities. Meanwhile, Ola supports user-friendly real-time streaming decoding for texts and speeches thanks to the text detokenizer and the speech decoder. in previous works, while existing open-sourced omni-modal solutions still have large performance gap between stateof-the-art specialized LLMs, making strong barrier between the concept of omni-modal and real-world applications. Moreover, the lack of capability in specific domains or tasks, the mass data demand, the delay for user interaction, and the inadequate alignment across modalities show the suboptimal for existing omni-modal models. In this paper, we propose the Ola model, exploring the solution for training an omni-modal Large Language Model with comparable performance with state-of-the-art specific LLMs, real-time interaction, and high efficiency on alignment data. The core design of the Ola model is the progressive modality alignment strategy. To build connections between language and vision, we start from two fundamental and separated modalities, image and text, to build the basic knowledge for omni-modal models. Subsequently, we gradually expand the training sets to equip the model with an extended ability including video frames that strengthen the visual understanding capability, speech data that connects the language and audio knowledge, and the video with audio that mixes up the information from language, video, and audio comprehensively. The progressively learning strategy makes omni-modal learning easier by disassembling the complex training procedure into small steps, therefore maintaining small size of cross-modal alignment data and making it easier to start from existing achievements in vision-language models. As shown in Fig. 3, the performance of Ola largely benefits from our progressive training pipeline, leading to more balanced and competitive results on all modalities. To cooperate with the training strategy, important improvements have been made to the architecture and data domains. 1) The Ola architecture supports omni-modal inputs and streaming text and speech generation with extendable and concise architecture design. We design the joint alignment module for vision and audio, fusing the visual inputs with local-global attention pooling layer, and make free combinations for visual, audio, and text tokens. Figure 3. Progressive modality alignment helps to learn better omni-modal models. We compare our progressive alignment strategy with two baseline training pipelines on Image QA(MMBench [40]), Video QA(VideoMME [21]), and ASR(LibriSpeech [54]): 1) direct mixing where all instruction tuning data is merged and trained in single stage, and 2) balanced sampling where we upsample certain sources to make the training data more balanced among modalities. The experiment is conducted on subsampled training set for efficiency and we train models for the same number of steps for fair comparisons. The score is normalized based on the score of progressive alignment to calculate the relative score and the ASR score is inverted as lower is better for the WER metric. extensive research has been done on connecting specific modalities with language responses [10, 32, 36, 55, 57, 67]. Recently, the success of GPT-4o [53] and Gemini [24] aiming at supporting more modalities in Large Language Models inspires researchers to take one imp"

Text:"DynVFX: Augmenting Real Videos with Dynamic Content DANAH YATIM, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel RAFAIL FRIDMAN, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel OMER BAR-TAL, Pika Labs, USA TALI DEKEL, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel 5 2 0 2 5 ] . [ 1 1 2 6 3 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Fig. 1. DynVFX augments real-world videos with new dynamic content described via simple user-provided text instruction. We present method for augmenting real-world videos with newly generated dynamic content. Given an input video and simple user-provided text instruction describing the desired content, our method synthesizes dynamic objects or complex scene effects that naturally interact with the existing scene over time. The position, appearance, and motion of the new content are seamlessly integrated into the original footage while accounting for camera motion, occlusions, and interactions with other dynamic objects in the scene, resulting in cohesive and realistic output video. We achieve this via zero-shot, training-free framework that harnesses pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer to synthesize the new content and pretrained Vision Language Model to envision the augmented scene in detail. Specifically, we introduce novel inference-based method that manipulates features within the attention mechanism, enabling accurate localization and seamless integration of the new content while preserving the integrity of the original scene. Our method is fully automated, requiring only simple user instruction. We demonstrate its effectiveness on wide range of edits applied to real-world videos, encompassing diverse objects and scenarios involving both camera and object motion1.

While some open-source alternatives have emerged, there is still a notable lag behind specialized single-modality models in performance. In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal language model that achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio understanding compared to specialized counterparts. The core design of Ola lies in its progressive modality alignment strategy that extends the supporting modality of the language model progressively. Our training pipeline begins with the most distinct modalities: image and text, then gradually expands the skill sets of the model using speech data that connects language and audio knowledge, and video data that connects all modalities. The progressive learning pipeline also enables us to maintain a relatively small size of the cross-modal alignment data, making developing omni-modal from existing vision-language models easy and less costly. Moreover, to unlock an advanced interactive experience like GPT-4o, we further design a sentence-wise decoding solution for streaming speech generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola surpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models of similar sizes. We aim to make Ola a fully open omni-modal understanding solution to advance future research in this emerging field. Model weights, code, and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/Ola-Omni/Ola.

We present a method for augmenting real-world videos with newly generated dynamic content. Given an input video and a simple user-provided text instruction describing the desired content, our method synthesizes dynamic objects or complex scene effects that naturally interact with the existing scene over time. The position, appearance, and motion of the new content are seamlessly integrated into the original footage while accounting for camera motion, occlusions, and interactions with other dynamic objects in the scene, resulting in a cohesive and realistic output video. We achieve this via a zero-shot, training-free framework that harnesses a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer to synthesize the new content and a pre-trained Vision Language Model to envision the augmented scene in detail. Specifically, we introduce a novel inference-based method that manipulates features within the attention mechanism, enabling accurate localization and seamless integration of the new content while preserving the integrity of the original scene. Our method is fully automated, requiring only a simple user instruction. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide range of edits applied to real-world videos, encompassing diverse objects and scenarios involving both camera and object motion.

Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models across various tasks, their continued scaling faces a critical challenge: the scarcity of high-quality pretraining data. While model architectures continue to evolve, the natural language data struggles to scale up. To tackle this bottleneck, we propose MAssive Genre-Audience~(MAGA) reformulation method, which systematic synthesizes diverse, contextually-rich pretraining data from existing corpus. This work makes three main contributions: (1) We propose MAGA reformulation method, a lightweight and scalable approach for pretraining corpus expansion, and build a 770B tokens MAGACorpus. (2) We evaluate MAGACorpus with different data budget scaling strategies, demonstrating consistent improvements across various model sizes (134M-13B), establishing the necessity for next-generation large-scale synthetic pretraining language models. (3) Through comprehensive analysis, we investigate prompt engineering's impact on synthetic training collapse and reveal limitations in conventional collapse detection metrics using validation losses. Our work shows that MAGA can substantially expand training datasets while maintaining quality, offering a reliably pathway for scaling models beyond data limitations.
