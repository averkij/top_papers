However, current approaches in this field tend to offer isolated solutions tailored to specific tasks, which can be inefficient and impractical for real-world applications. While some efforts have aimed to unify motion-related tasks, these methods simply use different modalities as conditions to guide motion generation. Consequently, they lack editing capabilities, fine-grained control, and fail to facilitate knowledge sharing across tasks. To address these limitations and provide versatile, unified framework capable of handling both human motion generation and editing, we introduce novel paradigm: Motion-Condition-Motion, which enables the unified formulation of diverse tasks with three concepts: source motion, condition, and target motion. Based on this paradigm, we propose unified framework, MotionLab, which incorporates rectified flows to learn the mapping from source motion to target motion, guided by the specified conditions.

We present AlphaGeometry2, significantly improved version of AlphaGeometry introduced in Trinh et al. (2024), which has now surpassed an average gold medalist in solving Olympiad geometry problems. To achieve this, we first extend the original AlphaGeometry language to tackle harder problems involving movements of objects, and problems containing linear equations of angles, ratios, and distances. This, together with other additions, has markedly improved the coverage rate of the AlphaGeometry language on International Math Olympiads (IMO) 2000-2024 geometry problems from 66% to 88%. The search process of AlphaGeometry2 has also been greatly improved through the use of Gemini architecture for better language modeling, and novel knowledge-sharing mechanism that combines multiple search trees. Together with further enhancements to the symbolic engine and synthetic data generation, we have significantly boosted the overall solving rate of AlphaGeometry2 to 84% for all geometry problems over the last 25 years, compared to 54% previously. AlphaGeometry2 was also part of the system that achieved silver-medal standard at IMO 2024 https://dpmd.ai/imo-silver. Last but not least, we report progress towards using AlphaGeometry2 as part of fully automated system that reliably solves geometry problems directly from natural language input.

However, current state-of-the-art TTS systems leveraging LLMs are often multistage, requiring separate models (e.g., diffusion models after LLM), complicating the decision of whether to scale particular model during training or testing. This work makes the following contributions: First, we explore the scaling of train-time and inference-time compute for speech synthesis. Second, we propose simple framework Llasa for speech synthesis that employs single-layer vector quantizer (VQ) codec and single Transformer architecture to fully align with standard LLMs such as Llama. Our experiments reveal that scaling train-time compute for Llasa consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech and enables the generation of more complex and accurate prosody patterns. Furthermore, from the perspective of scaling inferencetime compute, we employ speech understanding models as verifiers during the search, finding that scaling inference-time compute shifts the sampling modes toward the preferences of specific verifiers, thereby improving emotional expressiveness, timbre consistency, and content accuracy. In addition, we released the checkpoint and training code for our TTS model (1B, 3B, 8B) and codec model publicly available. *Equal contribution 1The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 2ASLP Lab, Northwestern Polytechnical University 3Independent Researcher 4University of Science and Technology Beijing 5University of Surrey 6Chinese University of Hong Kong 7Hong Kong Baptist University 8University of Rochester 9Shanghai Mobvoi Information Technology Co., Ltd.

Introduction Recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) in the text domain, represented by the GPT series(Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2019). These advances have demonstrated that increasing model size and training data consistently yields better performance across wide array of natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, as the text domain approaches data saturation, new directions are emerging, such as o1 models (Jaech et al., 2024) that emphasize extensive computational effort at test timethereby exhibiting an inference-time scaling effect. By investing more resources during inference, these models are able to produce higher-quality outputs and handle more complex tasks, offering flexible avenue for performance improvement after the training phase. Meanwhile, text-to-speech (TTS) research has also made impressive strides. Many existing TTS systems focus on devising better model architecturesleveraging well-designed modules, larger datasets, and increased model sizeto push synthesis quality ever higher. While these efforts have propelled the field forward, they also tend to narrow the communitys perspective: the focus on better architectures can overshadow investigations into broader, potentially transformative research questions. In contrast, the text LLM community has converged on relatively standard frameworka simple Transformer model with tokenizerwhich allows researchers to concentrate on fundamental issues such as training-time scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020), inferencetime scaling behaviors (Snell et al., 2024), and downstream adaptations (e.g., fine-tuning (Hu et al., 2021), pruning, and quantization(Zhu et al., 2024a)). Such common design philosophy has catalyzed rapid progress and deeper insights 1 Llasa: Scaling Train-Time and Inference-Time Compute for Llama-based Speech Synthesis into the text domain. Motivated by these observations, we propose aligning TTS with the minimalist yet powerful paradigm of text LLMs. We introduce single Transformer-based TTS model that relies on well-designed speech tokenizer. More specifically, our TTS system, named Llasa, is initialized from the Llama (Touvron et al., 2023) model with an expanded vocabulary that incorporates speech tokens and is trained using the nexttoken prediction paradigm. Although this model may not always match the performance of highly customized TTS systems, its streamlined design creates unified foundation for exploring wider range of research questionsbeyond architecture exploration. In particular, we systematically investigate both trainingtime and inference-time scaling effects under this unified TTS framework. Our experiments show that scaling trainingtime compute (e.g., increasing model size or training data) not only improves naturalness but also enhances expressive prosody, effectively capturing the meaning conveyed in text without explicit labels. Additionally, we examine the utility of inference-time scaling by incorporating speech understanding models as verifiers in the search process. We find that spending more computational effort during inference aligns generation outputs more closely with specific verifier biases, yielding better emotional expressiveness, timbre consistency, and content accuracy. Evaluations on LibriSpeech test sets (Panayotov et al., 2015), seed-tts-eval (Anastassiou et al., 2024) and ESD datasets (zho, 2022) demonstrate state-of-the-art results, and further highlight how in-context learning capabilities can be combined with search-based refinements to control factors such as speaker identity or emotion. In summary, our paper makes several key contributions. We design TTS model named Llasa that is fully aligned with standard LLM architectures by utilizing single Transformer and well-designed speech tokenizer, thereby creating simple, flexible, and scalable system. Additionally, we find that increasing training-time compute for Llasa leads to significant improvements in speech naturalness and prosody accuracy, which reflects deeper semantic understanding o"

Text:"PILAF: Optimal Human Preference Sampling for Reward Modeling Yunzhen Feng Ariel Kwiatkowski Kunhao Zheng Meta FAIR Meta FAIR NYU Julia Kempe Meta FAIR & NYU Yaqi Duan NYU 5 2 0 2 6 ] . [ 1 0 7 2 4 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r February 7, Abstract As large language models increasingly drive real-world applications, aligning them with human values becomes paramount. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as key technique, translating preference data into reward models when oracle human values remain inaccessible. In practice, RLHF mostly relies on approximate reward models, which may not consistently guide the policy toward maximizing the underlying human values. We propose Policy-Interpolated Learning for Aligned Feedback (PILAF), novel response sampling strategy for preference labeling that explicitly aligns preference learning with maximizing the underlying oracle reward. PILAF is theoretically grounded, demonstrating optimality from both an optimization and statistical perspective. The method is straightforward to implement and demonstrates strong performance in iterative and online RLHF settings where feedback curation is critical. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022) has revolutionized large language models (LLMs) by incorporating human preferences, enabling significant progress in applications such as conversational AI (Achiam et al., 2023), personalized tutoring (Limo et al., 2023), and content curation (Yue et al., 2024). At the core of RLHF is reward modeling, critical process that translates human feedbacksuch as pairwise comparisons or rankingsinto measurable objective for model training. By formalizing human preferences, reward models then guide LLMs towards alignment through policy optimization. While numerous studies have focused on improving language models (LMs) by optimizing fixed reward functions (Dong et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024c) or leveraging pre-existing preference datasets (Ethayarajh et al., 2024"

Human motion generation and editing are key components of computer graphics and vision. However, current approaches in this field tend to offer isolated solutions tailored to specific tasks, which can be inefficient and impractical for real-world applications. While some efforts have aimed to unify motion-related tasks, these methods simply use different modalities as conditions to guide motion generation. Consequently, they lack editing capabilities, fine-grained control, and fail to facilitate knowledge sharing across tasks. To address these limitations and provide a versatile, unified framework capable of handling both human motion generation and editing, we introduce a novel paradigm: Motion-Condition-Motion, which enables the unified formulation of diverse tasks with three concepts: source motion, condition, and target motion. Based on this paradigm, we propose a unified framework, MotionLab, which incorporates rectified flows to learn the mapping from source motion to target motion, guided by the specified conditions. In MotionLab, we introduce the 1) MotionFlow Transformer to enhance conditional generation and editing without task-specific modules; 2) Aligned Rotational Position Encoding} to guarantee the time synchronization between source motion and target motion; 3) Task Specified Instruction Modulation; and 4) Motion Curriculum Learning for effective multi-task learning and knowledge sharing across tasks. Notably, our MotionLab demonstrates promising generalization capabilities and inference efficiency across multiple benchmarks for human motion.

We present AlphaGeometry2, a significantly improved version of AlphaGeometry introduced in Trinh et al. (2024), which has now surpassed an average gold medalist in solving Olympiad geometry problems. To achieve this, we first extend the original AlphaGeometry language to tackle harder problems involving movements of objects, and problems containing linear equations of angles, ratios, and distances. This, together with other additions, has markedly improved the coverage rate of the AlphaGeometry language on International Math Olympiads (IMO) 2000-2024 geometry problems from 66% to 88%. The search process of AlphaGeometry2 has also been greatly improved through the use of Gemini architecture for better language modeling, and a novel knowledge-sharing mechanism that combines multiple search trees. Together with further enhancements to the symbolic engine and synthetic data generation, we have significantly boosted the overall solving rate of AlphaGeometry2 to 84% for all geometry problems over the last 25 years, compared to 54% previously. AlphaGeometry2 was also part of the system that achieved silver-medal standard at IMO 2024 https://dpmd.ai/imo-silver. Last but not least, we report progress towards using AlphaGeometry2 as a part of a fully automated system that reliably solves geometry problems directly from natural language input.

We present a novel video generation framework that integrates 3-dimensional geometry and dynamic awareness. To achieve this, we augment 2D videos with 3D point trajectories and align them in pixel space. The resulting 3D-aware video dataset, PointVid, is then used to fine-tune a latent diffusion model, enabling it to track 2D objects with 3D Cartesian coordinates. Building on this, we regularize the shape and motion of objects in the video to eliminate undesired artifacts, \eg, nonphysical deformation. Consequently, we enhance the quality of generated RGB videos and alleviate common issues like object morphing, which are prevalent in current video models due to a lack of shape awareness. With our 3D augmentation and regularization, our model is capable of handling contact-rich scenarios such as task-oriented videos. These videos involve complex interactions of solids, where 3D information is essential for perceiving deformation and contact. Furthermore, our model improves the overall quality of video generation by promoting the 3D consistency of moving objects and reducing abrupt changes in shape and motion.

"We present a novel video generation framework that integrates 3-dimensional geometry and dynamic awareness. To achieve this, we augment 2D videos with 3D point trajectories and align them in pixel space. The resulting 3D-aware video dataset, PointVid, is then used to fine-tune a latent diffusion model, enabling it to track 2D objects with 3D Cartesian coordinates. Building on this, we regularize the shape and motion of objects in the video to eliminate undesired artifacts, \eg, nonphysical deformation. Consequently, we enhance the quality of generated RGB videos and alleviate common issues like object morphing, which are prevalent in current video models due to a lack of shape awareness. With our 3D augmentation and regularization, our model is capable of handling contact-rich scenarios such as task-oriented videos. These videos involve complex interactions of solids, where 3D information is essential for perceiving deformation and contact. Furthermore, our model improves the overall quality of video generation by promoting the 3D consistency of moving objects and reducing abrupt changes in shape and motion."

This paper presents a method that allows users to design cinematic video shots in the context of image-to-video generation. Shot design, a critical aspect of filmmaking, involves meticulously planning both camera movements and object motions in a scene. However, enabling intuitive shot design in modern image-to-video generation systems presents two main challenges: first, effectively capturing user intentions on the motion design, where both camera movements and scene-space object motions must be specified jointly; and second, representing motion information that can be effectively utilized by a video diffusion model to synthesize the image animations. To address these challenges, we introduce MotionCanvas, a method that integrates user-driven controls into image-to-video (I2V) generation models, allowing users to control both object and camera motions in a scene-aware manner. By connecting insights from classical computer graphics and contemporary video generation techniques, we demonstrate the ability to achieve 3D-aware motion control in I2V synthesis without requiring costly 3D-related training data. MotionCanvas enables users to intuitively depict scene-space motion intentions, and translates them into spatiotemporal motion-conditioning signals for video diffusion models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of real-world image content and shot-design scenarios, highlighting its potential to enhance the creative workflows in digital content creation and adapt to various image and video editing applications.

Recent advances in text-based large language models (LLMs), particularly in the GPT series and the o1 model, have demonstrated the effectiveness of scaling both training-time and inference-time compute. However, current state-of-the-art TTS systems leveraging LLMs are often multi-stage, requiring separate models (e.g., diffusion models after LLM), complicating the decision of whether to scale a particular model during training or testing. This work makes the following contributions: First, we explore the scaling of train-time and inference-time compute for speech synthesis. Second, we propose a simple framework Llasa for speech synthesis that employs a single-layer vector quantizer (VQ) codec and a single Transformer architecture to fully align with standard LLMs such as Llama. Our experiments reveal that scaling train-time compute for Llasa consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech and enables the generation of more complex and accurate prosody patterns. Furthermore, from the perspective of scaling inference-time compute, we employ speech understanding models as verifiers during the search, finding that scaling inference-time compute shifts the sampling modes toward the preferences of specific verifiers, thereby improving emotional expressiveness, timbre consistency, and content accuracy. In addition, we released the checkpoint and training code for our TTS model (1B, 3B, 8B) and codec model publicly available.

As large language models increasingly drive real-world applications, aligning them with human values becomes paramount. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique, translating preference data into reward models when oracle human values remain inaccessible. In practice, RLHF mostly relies on approximate reward models, which may not consistently guide the policy toward maximizing the underlying human values. We propose Policy-Interpolated Learning for Aligned Feedback (PILAF), a novel response sampling strategy for preference labeling that explicitly aligns preference learning with maximizing the underlying oracle reward. PILAF is theoretically grounded, demonstrating optimality from both an optimization and a statistical perspective. The method is straightforward to implement and demonstrates strong performance in iterative and online RLHF settings where feedback curation is critical.

"As large language models increasingly drive real-world applications, aligning them with human values becomes paramount. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique, translating preference data into reward models when oracle human values remain inaccessible. In practice, RLHF mostly relies on approximate reward models, which may not consistently guide the policy toward maximizing the underlying human values. We propose Policy-Interpolated Learning for Aligned Feedback (PILAF), a novel response sampling strategy for preference labeling that explicitly aligns preference learning with maximizing the underlying oracle reward. PILAF is theoretically grounded, demonstrating optimality from both an optimization and a statistical perspective. The method is straightforward to implement and demonstrates strong performance in iterative and online RLHF settings where feedback curation is critical."
