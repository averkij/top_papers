[ 1 0 2 3 4 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r aDo the rich representations of multi-modal diffusion transformers (DiTs) exhibit unique properties that enhance their interpretability? We introduce CONCEPTATTENTION, novel method that leverages the expressive power of DiT attention layers to generate high-quality saliency maps that precisely locate textual concepts within images4. Without requiring additional training, CONCEPTATTENTION repurposes the parameters of DiT attention layers to produce highly contextualized concept embeddings, contributing the major discovery that performing linear projections in the output space of DiT attention layers yields significantly sharper saliency maps compared to commonly used cross-attention mechanisms. Remarkably, CONCEPTATTENTION even achieves state-of-the-art performance on zeroshot image segmentation benchmarks, outperforming 11 other zero-shot interpretability methods on the ImageNet-Segmentation dataset and on single-class subset of PascalVOC. Our work contributes the first evidence that the representations of multi-modal DiT models like Flux are highly transferable to vision tasks like segmentation, even outperforming multi-modal foundation models like CLIP. 1. Introduction Diffusion models have recently gained widespread popularity, emerging as the state-of-the-art approach for variety of generative tasks, particularly text-to-image synthesis (Rombach et al., 2022). These models transform random noise into photorealistic images guided by textual descriptions, achieving unprecedented fidelity and detail. Despite the impressive generative capabilities of diffusion models, our understanding of their internal mechanisms remains lim1Georgia Tech 2Virginia Tech 3IBM Research. Correspondence to: Alec Helbling <alechelbling@gatech.edu>. 4Code: https://alechelbling.com/ConceptAttention/ 1 Figure 1. CONCEPTATTENTION produces saliency maps that precisely localize the presence of textual concepts in images. We compare Flux raw cross attention, DAAM (Tang et al., 2022) with SDXL, and TextSpan (Gandelsman et al., 2024) for CLIP. ited. Diffusion models operate as black boxes, where the relationships between input prompts and generated outputs are visible, but the decision-making processes that connect them are hidden from human understanding. Existing work on interpreting T2I models has predominantly focused on UNet-based architectures (Podell et al., 2023; Rombach et al., 2022), which utilize shallow cross-attention mechanisms between prompt embeddings and image patch representations. UNet cross attention maps can produce high-fidelity saliency maps that predict the location of textual concepts (Tang et al., 2022) and have found numerous applications in tasks like image editing (Hertz et al., ConceptAttention: Diffusion Transformers Learn Highly Interpretable Features Figure 2. CONCEPTATTENTION augments multi-modal DiTs with sequence of concept embeddings that can be used to produce saliency maps. (Left) An unmodified multi-modal attention (MMATTN) layer processes both prompt and image tokens. (Right) CONCEPTATTENTION augments these layers without impacting the image appearance to create set of contextualized concept tokens. 2022; Chefer et al., 2023). However, the interpretability of more recent multi-modal diffusion transformers (DiTs) remains underexplored. DiT-based models have recently replaced UNets (Ronneberger et al., 2015) as the state-ofthe-art architecture for image generation, with models such as Flux (Labs, 2023) and SD3 (Esser et al., 2024) achieving breakthroughs in text-to-image generation. The rapid advancement and enhanced capabilities of DiT-based models highlight the critical importance of methods that improve their interpretability, transparency, and safety. In this work, we propose CONCEPTATTENTION, novel method that leverages the representations of multi-modal DiTs to produce high-fidelity saliency maps that localize textual concepts within images. Our method provides insight into the rich semantics of DiT representations. CONCEPTATTENTION is lightweight and requires no additional training, instead it repurposes the existing parameters of DiT attention layers. CONCEPTATTENTION works by producing set of rich contextualized text embeddings each corresponding to visual concepts (e.g. dragon, sun). By linearly projecting these concept embeddings and the image we can produce rich saliency maps that are even higher quality than commonly used cross attention maps. We evaluate the efficacy of CONCEPTATTENTION in zeroshot semantic segmentation task on real world images. We compare our interpretative maps against annotated segmentations to measure the accuracy and relevance of the attributions generated by our method. Our experiments and extensive comparisons demonstrate that CONCEPTATTENTION provides valuable insights into the inner workings of these otherwise complex black-box models. By explaining the meaning of the representations of generative models our method paves the way for advancements in interpretability, controllability, and trust in generative AI systems. In summary, we contribute: CONCEPTATTENTION, method for interpreting text-to-image diffusion transformers. Our method requires no additional training, by leveraging the representations of multi-modal DiTs to generate highly interpretable saliency maps that depict the presence of arbitrary textual concepts (e.g. dragon, sky, etc.) in images (as shown in Figure 1). The novel discovery that the output vectors of attention operations produce higher-quality saliency maps than cross attentions. CONCEPTATTENTION repurposes the parameters of DiT attention layers to produce set of rich textual embeddings corresponding to different concepts, something that is uniquely enabled by multi-modal DiT architectures. By performing linear projections between these concept embeddings and image patch representations in the attention output space we can produce high quality saliency maps. CONCEPTATTENTION generalizes to achieve stateof-the-art performance in zero-shot segmentation on benchmarks like ImageNet Segmentation and Pascal VOC. We achieve superior performance to diverse set of zero-shot interpretability methods based on various foundation models like CLIP, DINO, and UNet-based diffusion models; this highlights the pot"

Do the rich representations of multi-modal diffusion transformers (DiTs) exhibit unique properties that enhance their interpretability? We introduce ConceptAttention, a novel method that leverages the expressive power of DiT attention layers to generate high-quality saliency maps that precisely locate textual concepts within images. Without requiring additional training, ConceptAttention repurposes the parameters of DiT attention layers to produce highly contextualized concept embeddings, contributing the major discovery that performing linear projections in the output space of DiT attention layers yields significantly sharper saliency maps compared to commonly used cross-attention mechanisms. Remarkably, ConceptAttention even achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot image segmentation benchmarks, outperforming 11 other zero-shot interpretability methods on the ImageNet-Segmentation dataset and on a single-class subset of PascalVOC. Our work contributes the first evidence that the representations of multi-modal DiT models like Flux are highly transferable to vision tasks like segmentation, even outperforming multi-modal foundation models like CLIP.
