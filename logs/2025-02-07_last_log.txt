Text:"ChartCitor: Answer Citations for ChartQA via Multi-Agent LLM Retrieval Kanika Goswami IGDTUW, Delhi India 5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 9 8 9 0 0 . 2 0 5 2 : r Abstract Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform chart question-answering tasks but often generate unverified hallucinated responses. Existing answer attribution methods struggle to ground responses in source charts due to limited visual-semantic context, complex visual-text alignment requirements, and difficulties in bounding box prediction across complex layouts. We present ChartCitor, multi-agent framework that provides fine-grained bounding box citations by identifying supporting evidence within chart images. The system orchestrates LLM agents to perform chart-to-table extraction, answer reformulation, table augmentation, evidence retrieval through prefiltering and re-ranking, and table-to-chart mapping. ChartCitor outperforms existing baselines across different chart types. Qualitative user studies show that ChartCitor helps increase user trust in Generative AI by providing enhanced explainability for LLMassisted chart QA and enables professionals to be more productive.

Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform chart question-answering tasks but often generate unverified hallucinated responses. Existing answer attribution methods struggle to ground responses in source charts due to limited visual-semantic context, complex visual-text alignment requirements, and difficulties in bounding box prediction across complex layouts. We present ChartCitor, a multi-agent framework that provides fine-grained bounding box citations by identifying supporting evidence within chart images. The system orchestrates LLM agents to perform chart-to-table extraction, answer reformulation, table augmentation, evidence retrieval through pre-filtering and re-ranking, and table-to-chart mapping. ChartCitor outperforms existing baselines across different chart types. Qualitative user studies show that ChartCitor helps increase user trust in Generative AI by providing enhanced explainability for LLM-assisted chart QA and enables professionals to be more productive.

We introduce a new approach to systematically map features discovered by sparse autoencoder across consecutive layers of large language models, extending earlier work that examined inter-layer feature links. By using a data-free cosine similarity technique, we trace how specific features persist, transform, or first appear at each stage. This method yields granular flow graphs of feature evolution, enabling fine-grained interpretability and mechanistic insights into model computations. Crucially, we demonstrate how these cross-layer feature maps facilitate direct steering of model behavior by amplifying or suppressing chosen features, achieving targeted thematic control in text generation. Together, our findings highlight the utility of a causal, cross-layer interpretability framework that not only clarifies how features develop through forward passes but also provides new means for transparent manipulation of large language models.

我们介绍了一种新方法，系统地在大语言模型的连续层中映射稀疏自编码器发现的特征。我们使用无数据余弦相似度技术，追踪特定特征在每个阶段如何持续、转变或首次出现。这种方法产生特征演化的细粒度流图，实现细粒度的可解释性和模型计算的机制洞察。我们展示了这些跨层特征图如何通过放大或抑制选定特征，实现文本生成的定向主题控制。我们的发现突显了因果、跨层可解释性框架的实用性，不仅澄清了特征如何通过前向传递发展，还提供了透明操控大语言模型的新方法。
