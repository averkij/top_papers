To bridge this gap, we introduce UniTok, discrete visual tokenizer that encodes fine-grained details for generation while also capturing highlevel semantics for understanding. Despite recent studies have shown that these objectives could induce loss conflicts in training, we reveal that the underlying bottleneck stems from limited representational capacity of discrete tokens. We address this by introducing multi-codebook quantization, which divides vector quantization with several independent sub-codebooks to expand the latent feature space, while avoiding training instability caused by overlarge codebooks. Our method significantly raises the upper limit of unified discrete tokenizers to match or even surpass domainspecific continuous tokenizers. For instance, UniTok achieves remarkable rFID of 0.38 (versus 0.87 for SD-VAE) and zero-shot accuracy of 78.6% (versus 76.2% for CLIP) on ImageNet. Our code is available at https://github.com/ FoundationVision/UniTok. 1. Introduction Autoregressive modeling has recently extended its predominance in natural language processing to visual domains. This is characterized by the rapid growth of autoregressive models in image and video generation (Kondratyuk et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024c), as well as the increasing prevalence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for diverse visual understanding tasks (Liu et al., 2024a; Tong et al., 2024a; Wu et al., 2024c). Given these advancements in individual fields, there is growing interest in Project Lead 1The University of Hong Kong 2ByteDance Inc. 3Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

(b): Comparison with the unified tokenizer VILA-U in terms of ImageNet zero-shot accuracy and reconstruction FID. developing unified MLLMs by integrating visual generation and understanding within single autoregressive framework (Liu et al., 2024b; Team, 2024; Wang et al., 2024). However, critical challenge persists in unification: the disparity in visual tokenization for understanding and generation. For instance, the CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) tokenizer, widely used in multimodal understanding, does not naturally fit into generative modeling, which requires precise encoding of fine-grained details. Conversely, the VQVAE (Van Den Oord et al., 2017) tokenizer, which is tailored for autoregressive generation, potentially falls short of capturing high-level semantics crucial for visual understanding (Xie et al., 2024). To address this issue, recent studies attempt to use separate tokenizers for each task (Wu et al., 2024a), yet this increases model complexity without fundamentally bridging the gap in representation. These limitations underscore the need for unified visual tokenizer to serve both generation and understanding objectives. Recently, VILA-U (Wu et al., 2024d) has proposed promising paradigm for unified tokenizers, which integrates CLIP supervision into VQVAE training to complement VQ tokens with text alignment and rich semantics, as illustrated in Figure 1(a). Despite this innovation, it has been observed that the unified tokenizer struggles to converge in training and tends to underperform domain-specific tokenizers. This is commonly attributed to loss conflicts arising from divergent optimization goals (Wu et al., 2024d;a). However, recent studies on visual generation suggest that these objectives might not inherently conflict, as evidenced by the alignment UniTok: Unified Tokenizer for Visual Generation and Understanding behavior in generative and discriminative representation learning (Yu et al., 2024). This contrast raises an important question: Do reconstruction and contrastive losses truly conflict in unified tokenizer training, or might there be an underlying bottleneck that remains unidentified? To answer the question, we conduct comprehensive ablation study on the current unified tokenizer training paradigm (see Figure 3), which yields several intriguing findings. First, we show that removing reconstruction supervision, which equals training vector-quantized CLIP model, actually does not lead to better understanding performance over unified tokenizers. This observation indicates that the existing gap between unified and CLIP tokenizers mainly arise from vector quantization rather than the conflict of learning objectives. We further establish that this gap stems from both token factorization which projects tokens into lowerdimensional space for code index lookup (Yu et al., 2021) and discretization. These operations are essential for vector quantization but inevitably compromise the expressiveness of visual tokens. We thus identify that the primary bottleneck of unified tokenizers lies in the limited representational capacity of discrete tokens. To address this limitation, an intuitive approach is to expand the codebook size and latent code dimension of the tokenizer, which enables better approximation of the continuous feature space. However, this in practice could result in low codebook utilization (Zhu et al., 2024) and diminished performance gains (Yu et al., 2023b), while also making the code lookup process more computationally expensive. Drawing inspiration from the divide-and-conquer algorithm, we introduce multi-codebook quantization to alleviate this problem. Specifically, this involves dividing the visual token into multiple chunks and discretizing each with independent sub-codebooks, similar to the multi-head attention mechanism (Vaswani, 2017). Such design effectively scales up the latent code space by increasing the number of sub-codebooks, circumventing the optimization problem associated with large codebooks. Building upon multi-codebook quantization, we train unified tokenizer called UniTok to bridge visual generation and understanding. We conduct thorough evaluation of UniToks reconstruction and classification capabilities, and more importantly, its effectiveness in establishing unified MLLM. Experimental results show that UniTok ach"

We flexify DiTs and adjust the compute per diffusion step, generating high-quality samples with significantly less compute.how our approach can be readily extended for video generation, where FlexiDiT models generate samples with up to 75% less compute without compromising performance. Despite their remarkable performance, modern Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are hindered by substantial resource requirements during inference, stemming from the fixed and large amount of compute needed for each denoising step. In this work, we revisit the conventional static paradigm that allocates fixed compute budget per denoising iteration and propose dynamic strategy instead. Our simple and sample-efficient framework enables pre-trained DiT models to be converted into flexible ones dubbed FlexiDiT allowing them to process inputs at varying compute budgets. We demonstrate how single flexible model can generate images without any drop in quality, while reducing the required FLOPs by more than 40% compared to their static counterparts, for both class-conditioned and textconditioned image generation. Our method is general and agnostic to input and conditioning modalities. We show Work done during an internship at Meta GenAI. Meta GenAI. ETH Zurich. KAIST. Correspondence to: sanagnos@ethz.ch 1. Introduction Diffusion models [87] have recently become the core building block of major improvements in image generation [10, 13, 24, 90, 107]. These models gradually denoise random sample xt, drawn typically from pnoise = (0, I), by iteratively calling neural network trained to reverse pre-defined noise corruption process pθ(xt1xt). This process enables the generation of samples from the desired distribution pdata.The remarkable performance of these models is closely tied to the amount of computational resources invested in them, as evidenced by established scaling laws [52]. The Transformer architecture [95] has proven to be highly scalable across various modalities, leading to its adoption in diffusion models, in the form of the recent In DiTs, the denoising proDiffusion Transformer [78]. Figure 2. Diffusion can be viewed as spectral autoregression [25]. Left: Diffusion and its effect on the spatial frequency of images. Right: To investigate the role of different frequency components in image generation, we apply low or high pass filter to single diffusion step update (while keeping all other updates unchanged). With all other sources of randomness fixed, we compare the generated samples with and without filtering using LPIPS [110], L2 distance of the pixels, SSIM [99] and DreamSim [32]. Notably, the influence of low and high pass filters varies depending on whether they are applied early or late in the denoising process. cess pθ(xt1xt) is parametrized using Transformer blocks instead of traditional convolutional layers. As popularized in Vision Transformers [26], (latent) images of dimension are divided into patches of size p, which serve as input tokens that are transformed via series of attention and feed-forward layers. The use of DiTs offers two key advantages: (i) unified architecture and input processing framework that facilitates multimodal applications and generalization to other domains, such as audio and video; and (ii) exceptional scalability due to their signal propagation characteristics and efficient training on modern hardware. The computational complexity of DiT with hidden dimension and depth is O(LN d2 +LN 2d), where corresponds to the total number of tokens1. Given steps of the diffusion process, function calls to the same monolithic DiT model are repeated for all steps, and the total amount of compute is thus uniformly allocated. However, image generation via diffusion exhibits distinct, non-uniform, and temporally with respect to the noise process varying characteristics. Consistent with intuition, prior work has observed that high-level image features tend to emerge at early generative diffusion steps (i.e., large ts). In contrast, later steps refine and progressively generate high-frequency and detailed visual features [14]. We illustrate further differences during the denoising generation in Fig. 2. Concisely, different denoising steps have profoundly different influence on high and low-level features of the resulting images. In theory, different denoising methods and models can be employed for each step t, i.e. one can use separate parameters θt to learn pθt(xt1xt). While this notion has been previously explored in the literature, prior works propose computationally intensive solutions, such as training 1For high-resolution image generation even when diffusion is performed in latent space the second term O(LN 2d) that corresponds to the attention operations, can quickly become the main bottleneck. separate expert denoisers for different ts [5] or using model cascades [91]. These approaches face two significant limitations: (i) they require multiple models to be managed during inference, increasing memory demands. This can quickly become major issue, especially as current trends favor the use of larger and larger models. Moreover, (ii) using separate models restricts the opportunity for knowledge sharing across steps. Although one can treat denoising steps independently, the denoising process itself retains certain shared characteristics across steps. This inherent smoothness implies that separate models would need to learn these shared properties individually. In this work, we address these challenges and instead propose to perform different denoising steps with varying levels of compute using single model. In summary, our contributions are the following: We present simple framework that flexifies DiT models, allowing them to convert samples into different sequences of tokens by adjusting the patch size. Processing samples as different sequences enables us to control the compute budget being used for each denoising step. By leveraging specific image characteristics at different denoising steps, we demonstrate that strategically allocating less compute to certain steps can yield significant computational savings (over 40%) without compromising the quality of generated samples "

"The representation disparity between visual generation and understanding imposes a critical gap in integrating these capabilities into a single framework. To bridge this gap, we introduce UniTok, a discrete visual tokenizer that encodes fine-grained details for generation while also capturing high-level semantics for understanding. Despite recent studies have shown that these objectives could induce loss conflicts in training, we reveal that the underlying bottleneck stems from limited representational capacity of discrete tokens. We address this by introducing multi-codebook quantization, which divides vector quantization with several independent sub-codebooks to expand the latent feature space, while avoiding training instability caused by overlarge codebooks. Our method significantly raises the upper limit of unified discrete tokenizers to match or even surpass domain-specific continuous tokenizers. For instance, UniTok achieves a remarkable rFID of 0.38 (versus 0.87 for SD-VAE) and a zero-shot accuracy of 78.6% (versus 76.2% for CLIP) on ImageNet. Our code is available at https://github.com/FoundationVision/UniTok."

Despite their remarkable performance, modern Diffusion Transformers are hindered by substantial resource requirements during inference, stemming from the fixed and large amount of compute needed for each denoising step. In this work, we revisit the conventional static paradigm that allocates a fixed compute budget per denoising iteration and propose a dynamic strategy instead. Our simple and sample-efficient framework enables pre-trained DiT models to be converted into flexible ones -- dubbed FlexiDiT -- allowing them to process inputs at varying compute budgets. We demonstrate how a single flexible model can generate images without any drop in quality, while reducing the required FLOPs by more than 40\% compared to their static counterparts, for both class-conditioned and text-conditioned image generation. Our method is general and agnostic to input and conditioning modalities. We show how our approach can be readily extended for video generation, where FlexiDiT models generate samples with up to 75\% less compute without compromising performance.

Despite recent breakthroughs in reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) like DeepSeek-R1, incorporating inference-time reasoning into machine translation (MT), where human translators naturally employ structured, multi-layered reasoning chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), is yet underexplored. Existing methods either design a fixed CoT tailored for a specific MT sub-task (e.g., literature translation), or rely on synthesizing CoTs unaligned with humans and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) prone to catastrophic forgetting, limiting their adaptability to diverse translation scenarios. This paper introduces R1-Translator (R1-T1), a novel framework to achieve inference-time reasoning for general MT via reinforcement learning (RL) with human-aligned CoTs comprising six common patterns. Our approach pioneers three innovations: (1) extending reasoning-based translation beyond MT sub-tasks to six languages and diverse tasks (e.g., legal/medical domain adaptation, idiom resolution); (2) formalizing six expert-curated CoT templates that mirror hybrid human strategies like context-aware paraphrasing and back translation; and (3) enabling self-evolving CoT discovery and anti-forgetting adaptation through RL with KL-constrained rewards. Experimental results indicate a steady translation performance improvement in 21 languages and 80 translation directions on Flores-101 test set, especially on the 15 languages unseen from training, with its general multilingual abilities preserved compared with plain SFT.
