[ 1 4 3 6 9 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r MedVLM-R1: Incentivizing Medical Reasoning Capability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) via Reinforcement Learning Jiazhen Pan1,2, Che Liu3, Junde Wu2, Fenglin Liu2, Jiayun Zhu2, Hongwei Bran Li4, Chen Chen5,6, Cheng Ouyang2,6, Daniel Rueckert1,6 1 Chair for AI in Healthcare and Medicine, Technical University of Munich (TUM) and TUM University Hospital, Germany 2 Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK 3 Data Science Institute, Imperial College London, UK 4 Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, USA 5 School of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, UK 6 Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK Abstract. Reasoning is critical frontier for advancing medical image analysis, where transparency and trustworthiness play central role in both clinician trust and regulatory approval. Although Medical Visual Language Models (VLMs) show promise for radiological tasks, most existing VLMs merely produce final answers without revealing the underlying reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce MedVLM-R1, medical VLM that explicitly generates natural language reasoning to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Instead of relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often suffers from overfitting to training distributions and fails to foster genuine reasoning, MedVLM-R1 employs reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the model to discover human-interpretable reasoning paths without using any reasoning references. Despite limited training data (600 visual question answering samples) and model parameters (2B), MedVLM-R1 boosts accuracy from 55.11% to 78.22% across MRI, CT, and X-ray benchmarks, outperforming larger models trained on over million samples. It also demonstrates robust domain generalization under out-of-distribution tasks. By unifying medical image analysis with explicit reasoning, MedVLM-R1 marks pivotal step toward trustworthy and interpretable AI in clinic"

Building articulated objects is a key challenge in computer vision. Existing methods often fail to effectively integrate information across different object states, limiting the accuracy of part-mesh reconstruction and part dynamics modeling, particularly for complex multi-part articulated objects. We introduce ArtGS, a novel approach that leverages 3D Gaussians as a flexible and efficient representation to address these issues. Our method incorporates canonical Gaussians with coarse-to-fine initialization and updates for aligning articulated part information across different object states, and employs a skinning-inspired part dynamics modeling module to improve both part-mesh reconstruction and articulation learning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including a new benchmark for complex multi-part objects, demonstrate that ArtGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in joint parameter estimation and part mesh reconstruction. Our approach significantly improves reconstruction quality and efficiency, especially for multi-part articulated objects. Additionally, we provide comprehensive analyses of our design choices, validating the effectiveness of each component to highlight potential areas for future improvement.

  "desc": "ArtGS - это новый подход к реконструкции и моделированию динамики сочлененных объектов в компьютерном зрении. Метод использует 3D гауссианы для гибкого и эффективного представления частей объекта. ArtGS включает канонические гауссианы с инициализацией от грубого к точному для выравнивания информации о частях в разных состояниях объекта. Подход также применяет модуль моделирования динамики частей, вдохновленный скиннингом, для улучшения реконструкции и обучения артикуляции. Эксперименты показывают, что ArtGS достигает современного уровня производительности в оценке параметров соединений и реконструкции сетки частей, особенно для сложных многокомпонентных объектов.",
