Can machine truly understand the world without interacting with it? This question lies at the heart of the ongoing debate surrounding the capabilities of AI video generation models. While the generation of realistic videos has, for long time, been considered one of the major unsolved challenges within deep learning, this recently changed. Within relatively short period of time, the field has seen the development of impressive video generation models (13), capturing the imagin"
