Samples generated by Mimir. Our model demonstrates powerful spatiotemporal imagination for input text prompts, e.g., (row-3) physically accurate petals, (row-4) the desert with illumination harmonization, which closely match human cognition. Abstract Text serves as the key control signal in video generation due to its narrative nature. To render text descriptions into video clips, current video diffusion models borrow features from text encoders yet struggle with limited text comprehension. The recent success of large language models (LLMs) showcases the power of decoder-only transformers, which offers three clear benefits for text-to-video (T2V) generation, namely, precise text understanding resulting from the superior scalability, imagination beyond the input text enabled by next token prediction, and flexibility to *Equal contribution. Work done during internship at Ant Group. Project lead and corresponding author. prioritize user interests through instruction tuning. Nevertheless, the feature distribution gap emerging from the two different text modeling paradigms hinders the direct use of LLMs in established T2V models. This work addresses this challenge with Mimir, an end-to-end training framework featuring carefully tailored token fuser to harmonize the outputs from text encoders and LLMs. Such design allows the T2V model to fully leverage learned video priors while capitalizing on the text-related capability of LLMs. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of Mimir in generating high-quality videos with excellent text comprehension, especially when processing short captions and managing shifting motions.

We present TokenFlow, a novel unified image tokenizer that bridges the long-standing gap between multimodal understanding and generation. Prior research attempt to employ a single reconstruction-targeted Vector Quantization (VQ) encoder for unifying these two tasks. We observe that understanding and generation require fundamentally different granularities of visual information. This leads to a critical trade-off, particularly compromising performance in multimodal understanding tasks. TokenFlow addresses this challenge through an innovative dual-codebook architecture that decouples semantic and pixel-level feature learning while maintaining their alignment via a shared mapping mechanism. This design enables direct access to both high-level semantic representations crucial for understanding tasks and fine-grained visual features essential for generation through shared indices. Our extensive experiments demonstrate TokenFlow's superiority across multiple dimensions. Leveraging TokenFlow, we demonstrate for the first time that discrete visual input can surpass LLaVA-1.5 13B in understanding performance, achieving a 7.2\% average improvement. For image reconstruction, we achieve a strong FID score of 0.63 at 384*384 resolution. Moreover, TokenFlow establishes state-of-the-art performance in autoregressive image generation with a GenEval score of 0.55 at 256*256 resolution, achieving comparable results to SDXL.

Building realistic and animatable avatars still requires minutes of multi-view or monocular self-rotating videos, and most methods lack precise control over gestures and expressions. To push this boundary, we address the challenge of constructing a whole-body talking avatar from a single image. We propose a novel pipeline that tackles two critical issues: 1) complex dynamic modeling and 2) generalization to novel gestures and expressions. To achieve seamless generalization, we leverage recent pose-guided image-to-video diffusion models to generate imperfect video frames as pseudo-labels. To overcome the dynamic modeling challenge posed by inconsistent and noisy pseudo-videos, we introduce a tightly coupled 3DGS-mesh hybrid avatar representation and apply several key regularizations to mitigate inconsistencies caused by imperfect labels. Extensive experiments on diverse subjects demonstrate that our method enables the creation of a photorealistic, precisely animatable, and expressive whole-body talking avatar from just a single image.

"Building realistic and animatable avatars still requires minutes of multi-view or monocular self-rotating videos, and most methods lack precise control over gestures and expressions. To push this boundary, we address the challenge of constructing a whole-body talking avatar from a single image. We propose a novel pipeline that tackles two critical issues: 1) complex dynamic modeling and 2) generalization to novel gestures and expressions. To achieve seamless generalization, we leverage recent pose-guided image-to-video diffusion models to generate imperfect video frames as pseudo-labels. To overcome the dynamic modeling challenge posed by inconsistent and noisy pseudo-videos, we introduce a tightly coupled 3DGS-mesh hybrid avatar representation and apply several key regularizations to mitigate inconsistencies caused by imperfect labels. Extensive experiments on diverse subjects demonstrate that our method enables the creation of a photorealistic, precisely animatable, and expressive whole-body talking avatar from just a single image."

Diffusion models have been applied to 3D LiDAR scene completion due to their strong training stability and high completion quality. However, the slow sampling speed limits the practical application of diffusion-based scene completion models since autonomous vehicles require an efficient perception of surrounding environments. This paper proposes a novel distillation method tailored for 3D LiDAR scene completion models, dubbed ScoreLiDAR, which achieves efficient yet high-quality scene completion. ScoreLiDAR enables the distilled model to sample in significantly fewer steps after distillation. To improve completion quality, we also introduce a novel Structural Loss, which encourages the distilled model to capture the geometric structure of the 3D LiDAR scene. The loss contains a scene-wise term constraining the holistic structure and a point-wise term constraining the key landmark points and their relative configuration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ScoreLiDAR significantly accelerates the completion time from 30.55 to 5.37 seconds per frame (>5times) on SemanticKITTI and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art 3D LiDAR scene completion models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/happyw1nd/ScoreLiDAR.

This paper introduces MIDI, a novel paradigm for compositional 3D scene generation from a single image. Unlike existing methods that rely on reconstruction or retrieval techniques or recent approaches that employ multi-stage object-by-object generation, MIDI extends pre-trained image-to-3D object generation models to multi-instance diffusion models, enabling the simultaneous generation of multiple 3D instances with accurate spatial relationships and high generalizability. At its core, MIDI incorporates a novel multi-instance attention mechanism, that effectively captures inter-object interactions and spatial coherence directly within the generation process, without the need for complex multi-step processes. The method utilizes partial object images and global scene context as inputs, directly modeling object completion during 3D generation. During training, we effectively supervise the interactions between 3D instances using a limited amount of scene-level data, while incorporating single-object data for regularization, thereby maintaining the pre-trained generalization ability. MIDI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in image-to-scene generation, validated through evaluations on synthetic data, real-world scene data, and stylized scene images generated by text-to-image diffusion models.

Text serves as the key control signal in video generation due to its narrative nature. To render text descriptions into video clips, current video diffusion models borrow features from text encoders yet struggle with limited text comprehension. The recent success of large language models (LLMs) showcases the power of decoder-only transformers, which offers three clear benefits for text-to-video (T2V) generation, namely, precise text understanding resulting from the superior scalability, imagination beyond the input text enabled by next token prediction, and flexibility to prioritize user interests through instruction tuning. Nevertheless, the feature distribution gap emerging from the two different text modeling paradigms hinders the direct use of LLMs in established T2V models. This work addresses this challenge with Mimir, an end-to-end training framework featuring a carefully tailored token fuser to harmonize the outputs from text encoders and LLMs. Such a design allows the T2V model to fully leverage learned video priors while capitalizing on the text-related capability of LLMs. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of Mimir in generating high-quality videos with excellent text comprehension, especially when processing short captions and managing shifting motions.

"Text serves as the key control signal in video generation due to its narrative nature. To render text descriptions into video clips, current video diffusion models borrow features from text encoders yet struggle with limited text comprehension. The recent success of large language models (LLMs) showcases the power of decoder-only transformers, which offers three clear benefits for text-to-video (T2V) generation, namely, precise text understanding resulting from the superior scalability, imagination beyond the input text enabled by next token prediction, and flexibility to prioritize user interests through instruction tuning. Nevertheless, the feature distribution gap emerging from the two different text modeling paradigms hinders the direct use of LLMs in established T2V models. This work addresses this challenge with Mimir, an end-to-end training framework featuring a carefully tailored token fuser to harmonize the outputs from text encoders and LLMs. Such a design allows the T2V model to fully leverage learned video priors while capitalizing on the text-related capability of LLMs. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of Mimir in generating high-quality videos with excellent text comprehension, especially when processing short captions and managing shifting motions.
