Recent approaches have yielded promising results in distilling multi-step text-to-image diffusion models into one-step ones. The state-of-the-art efficient distillation technique, i.e., SwiftBrushv2 (SBv2), even surpasses the teacher model's performance with limited resources. However, our study reveals its instability when handling different diffusion model backbones due to using a fixed guidance scale within the Variational Score Distillation (VSD) loss. Another weakness of the existing one-step diffusion models is the missing support for negative prompt guidance, which is crucial in practical image generation. This paper presents SNOOPI, a novel framework designed to address these limitations by enhancing the guidance in one-step diffusion models during both training and inference. First, we effectively enhance training stability through Proper Guidance-SwiftBrush (PG-SB), which employs a random-scale classifier-free guidance approach. By varying the guidance scale of both teacher models, we broaden their output distributions, resulting in a more robust VSD loss that enables SB to perform effectively across diverse backbones while maintaining competitive performance. Second, we propose a training-free method called Negative-Away Steer Attention (NASA), which integrates negative prompts into one-step diffusion models via cross-attention to suppress undesired elements in generated images. Our experimental results show that our proposed methods significantly improve baseline models across various metrics. Remarkably, we achieve an HPSv2 score of 31.08, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark for one-step diffusion models.

"Recent approaches have yielded promising results in distilling multi-step text-to-image diffusion models into one-step ones. The state-of-the-art efficient distillation technique, i.e., SwiftBrushv2 (SBv2), even surpasses the teacher model's performance with limited resources. However, our study reveals its instability when handling different diffusion model backbones due to using a fixed guidance scale within the Variational Score Distillation (VSD) loss. Another weakness of the existing one-step diffusion models is the missing support for negative prompt guidance, which is crucial in practical image generation. This paper presents SNOOPI, a novel framework designed to address these limitations by enhancing the guidance in one-step diffusion models during both training and inference. First, we effectively enhance training stability through Proper Guidance-SwiftBrush (PG-SB), which employs a random-scale classifier-free guidance approach. By varying the guidance scale of both teacher models, we broaden their output distributions, resulting in a more robust VSD loss that enables SB to perform effectively across diverse backbones while maintaining competitive performance.

While fusing heterogeneous open-source LLMs with varying architectures and sizes can potentially integrate the strengths of different models, existing fusion methods face significant challenges, such as vocabulary alignment and merging distribution matrices. These procedures are not only complex but also prone to introducing noise and errors. In this paper, we propose an implicit fusion method, Weighted-Reward Preference Optimization (WRPO), which leverages preference optimization between the source LLMs and the target LLM to transfer their capabilities effectively. WRPO eliminates the need for vocabulary alignment and matrix fusion and can be efficiently scaled to accommodate various LLMs. To address distributional deviations between the source and target LLMs, WRPO introduces a progressive adaptation strategy that gradually shifts reliance on preferred examples from the target LLM to the source LLMs. Extensive experiments on the MT-Bench, AlpacaEval-2, and Arena-Hard benchmarks demonstrate that WRPO consistently outperforms existing knowledge fusion methods and various fine-tuning baselines. When applied to LLaMA3-8B-Instruct as the target model, WRPO achieves a length-controlled win rate of 55.9% against GPT-4-Preview-1106 on AlpacaEval-2 and a win rate of 46.2% against GPT-4-0314 on Arena-Hard.
