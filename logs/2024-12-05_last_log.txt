We combine the SigLIP-So400m vision encoder that was also used by PaliGemma with the whole range of Gemma 2 models, from the 2B one all the way up to the 27B model. We train these models at three resolutions (224px2, 448px2 and 896px2) in multiple stages to equip them with broad knowledge for transfer via fine-tuning. The resulting family of base models covering different model sizes and resolutions allows us to investigate factors impacting transfer performance (such as learning rate) and to analyze the interplay between the type of task, model size, and resolution. We further increase the number and breadth of transfer tasks beyond the scope of PaliGemma including different OCR-related tasks such as table structure recognition, molecular structure recognition, music score recognition, as well as long fine-grained captioning and radiography report generation, on which PaliGemma 2 obtains state-of-the-art results. 1. Introduction PaliGemma [9] is 3B vision-language model (VLM) for transfer combining the SigLIP [108] vision encoder and the 2B Gemma language model [21]. It matches the performance of much larger prior VLMs consisting of range of different vision encoders and language models. We now upgrade PaliGemma by replacing its language model component with the more recent and more capable language models from the Gemma 2 family [22], producing new PaliGemma 2 base VLMs at 3 different sizes (3B"

The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly impacted various multimodal tasks. However, these models face challenges in tasks that require spatial understanding within 3D environments. Efforts to enhance MLLMs, such as incorporating point cloud features, have been made, yet a considerable gap remains between the models' learned representations and the inherent complexity of 3D scenes. This discrepancy largely stems from the training of MLLMs on predominantly 2D data, which restricts their effectiveness in comprehending 3D spaces. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel generalist model, i.e., Video-3D LLM, for 3D scene understanding. By treating 3D scenes as dynamic videos and incorporating 3D position encoding into these representations, our Video-3D LLM aligns video representations with real-world spatial contexts more accurately. Additionally, we have implemented a maximum coverage sampling technique to optimize the balance between computational costs and performance efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several 3D scene understanding benchmarks, including ScanRefer, Multi3DRefer, Scan2Cap, ScanQA, and SQA3D.

'emoji': emoji that will reflect the theme of an article somehow, only one emoji. 'title': a slogan of a main idea of the article in Russian. Return only JSON and nothing else.

In this paper, we introduce an open-source Korean-English vision-language model (VLM), VARCO-VISION. We incorporate a step-by-step training strategy that allows a model learn both linguistic and visual information while preserving the backbone model's knowledge. Our model demonstrates outstanding performance in diverse settings requiring bilingual image-text understanding and generation abilities compared to models of similar size. VARCO-VISION is also capable of grounding, referring, and OCR, expanding its usage and potential applications for real-world scenarios. In addition to the model, we release five Korean evaluation datasets, including four closed-set and one openset benchmarks. We anticipate that our milestone will broaden the opportunities for AI researchers aiming to train VLMs. VARCO-VISION is available at https://huggingface.co/NCSOFT/VARCO-VISION-14B.
