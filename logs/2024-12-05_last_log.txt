LUMINET transfers complex lighting conditions from target image (a) to source image (b), synthesizing relit version of the source image (c) while preserving its geometry and albedo. In the top row, observe how LUMINET transforms the scene from nighttime to daytime by transferring strong directional light from the target images window to the source image. Key details in the relit image include pronounced gloss on the table, shadows cast onto the carpet (center left), cast shadows from the TV stand (left corner), and, most importantly, reflections of the table on the TV screen (d, e). These changes demonstrate plausible control over both direct and indirect lighting effects, such as reflections, specular highlights and shadow placement. In the bottom row, LUMINET knows about luminaires. In the relit image, two bedside lamps illuminate the scene, transforming it from dimly lit room into well-lit environment. This suggests that LUMINET recognizes the spatial arrangement of objects and infers where light sources should be switched on. Note how LUMINET introduces specular highlights on the left painting (see crop) and gloss in the far-right corner of the bedroom, where previously invisible bedside lamp is now turned on. These results show LUMINETs ability to handle complex lighting phenomenaincluding direct illumination, specular highlights, cast shadows, inter-reflections and other indirect effectswhile maintaining scene geometry, and albedo.

We introduce LumiNet, a novel architecture that leverages generative models and latent intrinsic representations for effective lighting transfer. Given a source image and a target lighting image, LumiNet synthesizes a relit version of the source scene that captures the target's lighting. Our approach makes two key contributions: a data curation strategy from the StyleGAN-based relighting model for our training, and a modified diffusion-based ControlNet that processes both latent intrinsic properties from the source image and latent extrinsic properties from the target image. We further improve lighting transfer through a learned adaptor (MLP) that injects the target's latent extrinsic properties via cross-attention and fine-tuning.   Unlike traditional ControlNet, which generates images with conditional maps from a single scene, LumiNet processes latent representations from two different images - preserving geometry and albedo from the source while transferring lighting characteristics from the target. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully transfers complex lighting phenomena including specular highlights and indirect illumination across scenes with varying spatial layouts and materials, outperforming existing approaches on challenging indoor scenes using only images as input.
