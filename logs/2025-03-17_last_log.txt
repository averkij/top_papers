INTRODUCTION In real-world robotic manipulation, collecting real-scene imitation learning data requires humans to teleoperate robotic arms to perform tasks based on linguistic instructions, which is labor-intensive and costly process [1], [2]. Each demonstration demands significant human effort (e.g., expert operation, precise annotation), making it economically infeasible to scale data quantity for diverse environmental coverage. Real-world complexityvarying object configurations, lighting, and task constraintsfurther exacerbates the need for massive data diversity to ensure robust generalization [3]. While recent approaches attempt to address this by generating diversity through simulated environments [4], [5] or lowcost Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) grippers [3], [6] (sampling one variation per trial, such as object poses), these methods face two fundamental limitations: indicates the equal contribution and indicates corresponding authors. Siyuan Huang is with Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Yue Liao and Hongsheng Li are with MMLab, CUHK. Siyuan Feng, Shu Jiang, Maoqing Yao and Guanghui Ren are with Agibot. Si Liu is with Beihang University. Comparative Analysis of the Real-Data Collection Loop in Fig. 1. Robotic Manipulation. (a) Traditional Approach: tele-operator executes tasks via fixed linguistic instructions in static visual environments. (b) Adversarial Data Collection (ADC) Framework: Employs Two-Humansin-the-Loop approach, where secondary operator intervenes to perturb the primarys execution dynamically when the tele-operator is executing task. (c) ADC Loop: The adversarial operator introduces visual (backgrounds, object positions/poses) and linguistic (task goals) perturbations, shifting environmental context and target objects within single episode. Synthetic data, despite its scalability, suffers from domain gap due to idealized physics/kinematics, hindering transfer to real-robot dynamics; Extending such diversity to tele-operated systems remains impractical, as even minor environmental changes (e.g., repositioning objects) require costly human-in-theloop resampling. To contextualize our approach, we first analyze the data requirements and structural constraints of state-of-the-art robotic imitation frameworks, particularly Vision-LanguageAction (VLA) models. VLAs integrate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to unify reasoning over visual inputs, language instructions, and robotic actions. Most VLA [7], [8] frameworks inherit the Markov assumption, predicting actions based solely on the current visual observation. This design necessitates training data in the form of triplets: current visual scene, language instruction, and action supervision. As shown in Fig. 1(a), Conventional data collection, however, treats an entire task (e.g., grasping the orange) as single demonstration, slicing it into ineffisequential units. These units suffer from inherent cienciesvisually redundant frames, repetitive language instructions, and highly correlated actionseffectively diluting the informational value of each collected demonstration. For instance, 30-second pick-and-place task might yield hundreds of near-identical diversity in scenes or commands. training triplets, with minimal To overcome these limitations, we propose Adversarial Data Collection (ADC), collaborative Human-in-theLoop (HiL) framework that systematically injects controlled perturbations during data acquisition to maximize per-demonstration diversity and robustness. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the ADC framework operates through two synchronized human roles: tele-operator executes primary manipulation tasks via standard robotic interfaces, while an adversarial operator dynamically modulates task parameters through real-time perturbations across perceptual, linguistic, and physical dimensions. During single demonstration episode, the adversarial operator alters scene configurations (e.g., repositioning objects, rotating target objects mid-grasp and adjusting background) and paraphrases task instructions (e.g., grasping the orange grasping the watermelon). These perturbations force the tele-operator to adaptively re-plan actions, such as re-grasping strategies or trajectory cor"

Text:"Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention: Is Learnable Attention Better For Vision Transformers? Subhajit Maity 1 Killian Hitsman 2 Xin Li 2 Aritra Dutta 2 1 5 2 0 2 3 1 ] . [ 1 2 3 6 0 1 . 3 0 5 2 : r Abstract Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are remarkable innovation consisting of learnable activation functions with the potential to capture more complex relationships from data. Although KANs are useful in finding symbolic representations and continual learning of one-dimensional functions, their effectiveness in diverse machine learning (ML) tasks, such as vision, remains questionable. Presently, KANs are deployed by replacing multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in deep network architectures, including advanced architectures such as vision Transformers (ViTs). In this paper, we are the first to design general learnable Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KArAt) for vanilla ViTs that can operate on any choice of basis. However, the computing and memory costs of training them motivated us to propose more modular version, and we designed particular learnable attention, called Fourier-KArAt. FourierKArAt and its variants either outperform their ViT counterparts or show comparable performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K datasets. We dissect these architectures performance and generalization capacity by analyzing their loss landscapes, weight distributions, optimizer path, attention visualization, and spectral behavior, and contrast them with vanilla ViTs. The goal of this paper is not to produce parameterand compute-efficient attention, but to encourage the community to explore KANs in conjunction with more advanced architectures that require careful understanding of learnable activations.

State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to the popular transformer-based models and have been increasingly gaining attention. Compared to transformers, SSMs excel at tasks with sequential data or longer contexts, demonstrating comparable performances with significant efficiency gains. In this survey, we provide a coherent and systematic overview for SSMs, including their theoretical motivations, mathematical formulations, comparison with existing model classes, and various applications. We divide the SSM series into three main sections, providing a detailed introduction to the original SSM, the structured SSM represented by S4, and the selective SSM typified by Mamba. We put an emphasis on technicality, and highlight the various key techniques introduced to address the effectiveness and efficiency of SSMs. We hope this manuscript serves as an introduction for researchers to explore the theoretical foundations of SSMs.

Bridging different modalities lies at the heart of cross-modality generation. While conventional approaches treat the text modality as a conditioning signal that gradually guides the denoising process from Gaussian noise to the target image modality, we explore a much simpler paradigm-directly evolving between text and image modalities through flow matching. This requires projecting both modalities into a shared latent space, which poses a significant challenge due to their inherently different representations: text is highly semantic and encoded as 1D tokens, whereas images are spatially redundant and represented as 2D latent embeddings. To address this, we introduce FlowTok, a minimal framework that seamlessly flows across text and images by encoding images into a compact 1D token representation. Compared to prior methods, this design reduces the latent space size by 3.3x at an image resolution of 256, eliminating the need for complex conditioning mechanisms or noise scheduling. Moreover, FlowTok naturally extends to image-to-text generation under the same formulation. With its streamlined architecture centered around compact 1D tokens, FlowTok is highly memory-efficient, requires significantly fewer training resources, and achieves much faster sampling speeds-all while delivering performance comparable to state-of-the-art models. Code will be available at https://github.com/bytedance/1d-tokenizer.

The pursuit of data efficiency, where quality outweighs quantity, has emerged as a cornerstone in robotic manipulation, especially given the high costs associated with real-world data collection. We propose that maximizing the informational density of individual demonstrations can dramatically reduce reliance on large-scale datasets while improving task performance. To this end, we introduce Adversarial Data Collection, a Human-in-the-Loop (HiL) framework that redefines robotic data acquisition through real-time, bidirectional human-environment interactions. Unlike conventional pipelines that passively record static demonstrations, ADC adopts a collaborative perturbation paradigm: during a single episode, an adversarial operator dynamically alters object states, environmental conditions, and linguistic commands, while the tele-operator adaptively adjusts actions to overcome these evolving challenges. This process compresses diverse failure-recovery behaviors, compositional task variations, and environmental perturbations into minimal demonstrations. Our experiments demonstrate that ADC-trained models achieve superior compositional generalization to unseen task instructions, enhanced robustness to perceptual perturbations, and emergent error recovery capabilities. Strikingly, models trained with merely 20% of the demonstration volume collected through ADC significantly outperform traditional approaches using full datasets. These advances bridge the gap between data-centric learning paradigms and practical robotic deployment, demonstrating that strategic data acquisition, not merely post-hoc processing, is critical for scalable, real-world robot learning. Additionally, we are curating a large-scale ADC-Robotics dataset comprising real-world manipulation tasks with adversarial perturbations. This benchmark will be open-sourced to facilitate advancements in robotic imitation learning.

Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are a remarkable innovation consisting of learnable activation functions with the potential to capture more complex relationships from data. Although KANs are useful in finding symbolic representations and continual learning of one-dimensional functions, their effectiveness in diverse machine learning (ML) tasks, such as vision, remains questionable. Presently, KANs are deployed by replacing multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in deep network architectures, including advanced architectures such as vision Transformers (ViTs). In this paper, we are the first to design a general learnable Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KArAt) for vanilla ViTs that can operate on any choice of basis. However, the computing and memory costs of training them motivated us to propose a more modular version, and we designed particular learnable attention, called Fourier-KArAt. Fourier-KArAt and its variants either outperform their ViT counterparts or show comparable performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K datasets. We dissect these architectures' performance and generalization capacity by analyzing their loss landscapes, weight distributions, optimizer path, attention visualization, and spectral behavior, and contrast them with vanilla ViTs.

"Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are a remarkable innovation consisting of learnable activation functions with the potential to capture more complex relationships from data. Although KANs are useful in finding symbolic representations and continual learning of one-dimensional functions, their effectiveness in diverse machine learning (ML) tasks, such as vision, remains questionable. Presently, KANs are deployed by replacing multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in deep network architectures, including advanced architectures such as vision Transformers (ViTs). In this paper, we are the first to design a general learnable Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KArAt) for vanilla ViTs that can operate on any choice of basis. However, the computing and memory costs of training them motivated us to propose a more modular version, and we designed particular learnable attention, called Fourier-KArAt. Fourier-KArAt and its variants either outperform their ViT counterparts or show comparable performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K datasets. We dissect these architectures' performance and generalization capacity by analyzing their loss landscapes, weight distributions, optimizer path, attention visualization, and spectral behavior, and contrast them with vanilla ViTs. The goal of this paper is not to produce parameter- and compute-efficient attention, but to encourage the community to explore KANs in conjunction with more advanced architectures that require a careful understanding of learnable activations.

We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the NavsimDauner2024_navsim, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YvanYin/GoalFlow.
