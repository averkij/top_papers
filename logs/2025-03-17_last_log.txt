While diffusion distillation methodsbased on distribution matching [19, 41] and trajectory matching [27, 35]reduce sampling to as few as one step, they fall short on complex tasks like textto-image generation. Few-step generation offers better balance between speed and quality, but existing approaches face persistent trade-off: distribution matching lacks flexibility for multi-step sampling, while trajectory matching often yields suboptimal image quality. To bridge this gap, we propose learning few-step diffusion models by Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), unified distillation paradigm that combines the strengths of distribution and trajectory matching. Our method introduces datafree score distillation objective, aligning the students trajectory with the teachers at the distribution level. Further, we develop sampling-steps-aware objective that de- *Work was partly done during an internship at Huawei Noahs Ark Lab. Corresponding Author.

This is accomplished with 500 iterations and 2 A800 hours mere 0.01% of the teachers training cost. In addition, our proposed TDM can be extended to accelerate text-tovideo diffusion. Notably, TDM can outperform its teacher model (CogVideoX-2B) by using only 4 NFE on VBench, improving the total score from 80.91 to 81.65. Project page: https://tdm-t2x.github.io/. 1. Introduction Accelerating diffusion model sampling is essential for the efficient deployment of AIGC models. Thanks to various diffusion distillation techniques, the number of sampling 1 Figure 2.

It can be seen that the ultra-fast convergence of our method, without sacrificing the sample quality. steps has been drastically reduced to as few as one. Most notably, approaches based on distribution matching through score distillation, such as DMD [41], Diff-Instruct [19], and SiD [44], have demonstrated strong performance in this regime. However, even state-of-the-art one-step generation methods fall short in complex tasks, particularly in textIn such cases, few-step generation to-image generation. strikes better balance between speed and image quality. Yet, existing distribution matching methods are primarily designed for one-step generation, optimizing solely for performance at this extreme and lacking the flexibility to extract extra information with increased sampling steps. An alternative approach, commonly known as trajectory distillation [16, 27, 35], operates on the instance level, aiming to simulate the original diffusion generation trajectories in as few steps as possible. However, matching entire instancelevel trajectories with fewer steps poses substantial challenges, requiring high model capacity. Consequently, its performance in few-step generation remains suboptimal. To bridge this gap, we propose novel framework that non-trivially unifies trajectory distillation and distribution matching, termed Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM). Specifically, our approach aligns the students trajectory with the teachers at the distribution level using novel, data-free score distillation objective. TDM supports deterministic sampling which inherently has better fewstep performance than stochastic sampling, enabling faster convergence [1, 14, 15, 32]. Our method combines the strengths of both distribution and trajectory matching. On the distribution matching side, the addition of trajectory information enables us to better inherit teachers knowledge in fine-grained fashion for multi-step generation. On the trajectory matching side, since we match the pre-trained diffusion distribution at different timesteps, the learning of the generator becomes easier, and better performance is expected from the same model capacity. To accommodate diverse use cases, an ideal generator should also offer users flexible control over the number of sampling steps. However, existing works in text-to-image diffusion distillation either only support less-adjustable steps based on deterministic sampling [11, 27, 39] or adjustable steps based on stochastic sampling, which sacrifices image quality for flexibility [17, 25]. To address these limitations, we propose novel sampling-steps-aware objective that decouples learning targets among different sampling steps, enabling flexible deterministic sampling. We name the model trained with this technique as TDM-unify. Furthermore, inspired by our new perspective built on the commonalities between TDM and CMs [35], we introduce surrogate training objective that employs the Pseudo-Huber metric, which has proven effective in iCT [33]. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various text-to-image backbones with remarkable efficiency. On SD-v1.5 [26], our TDM-unify demonstrates superior performance in both 1-step and 4-step generation, substantially outperforming existing approaches. On distilling SDXL [24] for 4-step inference, our method surpasses SDXL-Lightning [11] by +2.17 in Human Preference Score (HPS) [37] and +1.05 in CLIP Score, outperforms Hyper-SD [25] by +0.74 in HPS and +1.81 in CLIP Score, and exceeds DMD2 [42] by +3.42 in HPS and +0.57 in CLIP Score.

Precision therapeutics require multimodal adaptive models that generate personalized treatment recommendations. We introduce TxAgent, an AI agent that leverages multi-step reasoning and real-time biomedical knowledge retrieval across a toolbox of 211 tools to analyze drug interactions, contraindications, and patient-specific treatment strategies. TxAgent evaluates how drugs interact at molecular, pharmacokinetic, and clinical levels, identifies contraindications based on patient comorbidities and concurrent medications, and tailors treatment strategies to individual patient characteristics. It retrieves and synthesizes evidence from multiple biomedical sources, assesses interactions between drugs and patient conditions, and refines treatment recommendations through iterative reasoning. It selects tools based on task objectives and executes structured function calls to solve therapeutic tasks that require clinical reasoning and cross-source validation. The ToolUniverse consolidates 211 tools from trusted sources, including all US FDA-approved drugs since 1939 and validated clinical insights from Open Targets. TxAgent outperforms leading LLMs, tool-use models, and reasoning agents across five new benchmarks: DrugPC, BrandPC, GenericPC, TreatmentPC, and DescriptionPC, covering 3,168 drug reasoning tasks and 456 personalized treatment scenarios. It achieves 92.1% accuracy in open-ended drug reasoning tasks, surpassing GPT-4o and outperforming DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in structured multi-step reasoning. TxAgent generalizes across drug name variants and descriptions. By integrating multi-step inference, real-time knowledge grounding, and tool-assisted decision-making, TxAgent ensures that treatment recommendations align with established clinical guidelines and real-world evidence, reducing the risk of adverse events and improving therapeutic decision-making.

Accelerating diffusion model sampling is crucial for efficient AIGC deployment. While diffusion distillation methods -- based on distribution matching and trajectory matching -- reduce sampling to as few as one step, they fall short on complex tasks like text-to-image generation. Few-step generation offers a better balance between speed and quality, but existing approaches face a persistent trade-off: distribution matching lacks flexibility for multi-step sampling, while trajectory matching often yields suboptimal image quality. To bridge this gap, we propose learning few-step diffusion models by Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), a unified distillation paradigm that combines the strengths of distribution and trajectory matching. Our method introduces a data-free score distillation objective, aligning the student's trajectory with the teacher's at the distribution level. Further, we develop a sampling-steps-aware objective that decouples learning targets across different steps, enabling more adjustable sampling. This approach supports both deterministic sampling for superior image quality and flexible multi-step adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency. Our model, TDM, outperforms existing methods on various backbones, such as SDXL and PixArt-alpha, delivering superior quality and significantly reduced training costs. In particular, our method distills PixArt-alpha into a 4-step generator that outperforms its teacher on real user preference at 1024 resolution. This is accomplished with 500 iterations and 2 A800 hours -- a mere 0.01% of the teacher's training cost. In addition, our proposed TDM can be extended to accelerate text-to-video diffusion. Notably, TDM can outperform its teacher model (CogVideoX-2B) by using only 4 NFE on VBench, improving the total score from 80.91 to 81.65. Project page: https://tdm-t2x.github.io/
