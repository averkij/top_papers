EDERATED Learning (FL) [1][3] is framework that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train model the need to disclose their private local data. The without distinctive features of FL make it particularly suitable for developing machine learning models in privacy sensitive scenarios such as healthcare [4][6] and financial services [7], [8]. Although FL is designed to protect data privacy by only sharing model gradients, several studies have shown that attackers can still extract sensitive information about private training data through Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIA) [9], [10], Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) [11], [12], or Property Inference Attacks (PIA) [13], [14]. Among these privacy attacks, GIA, which focuses on reconstructing input data via either an honest-but-curious server that follows the FL protocol but is interested in uncovering input data [9], [10], [15], or malicious server that may modify the model architecture or parameters sent to the user [16][18], has emerged as the most powerful and is the focus of this work. Many GIA methods have been proposed, but detailed analysis, evaluation, and summary of these methods is still lacking. Although there are various surveys [19][25] summarizing existing privacy attacks in FL, few studies have conducted extensive experiments to reveal the effectiveness of GIA and their associated limiting factors in this context. Among the limited research on this topic, the works [10], [26], [27] are the most closely related to ours. However, these methods focus solely on analyzing partial GIA methods, leaving the applicability of their findings to other types of GIA uncertain. To fill this gap, we aim to conduct comprehensive study of GIA, including literature review, categorization of existing methods, in-depth analysis, and extensive evaluation. Specifically, we first undertake systematic review of current GIA methods and divide them into three categories (Section II): (1) Optimization-based GIA (OP-GIA): OP-GIA works by minimizing the distance between the received gradients and the gradients computed from dummy data [9], [15], [28][33]. (2) Generation-based GIA (GEN-GIA): GEN-GIA utilizes generator to reconstruct input data [34][41]. (3) Analyticsbased GIA (ANA-GIA): ANA-GIA aims to recover input data in closed form using malicious server [16][18], [42][44]. Additionally, based on the different optimization components of the GEN-GIA methods, they can be further categorized into (i) optimizing latent vector [34][36], (ii) optimizing gener00000000/00$00.00 2021 IEEE JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 2 TABLE COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF GIA METHODS IN TERMS OF INFLUENCE FACTORS, RECONSTRUCTION RESULTS, AND EXTRA RELIANCE OF EACH TYPE OF METHOD.

Diffusion models have shown impressive results in generating high-quality conditional samples using guidance techniques such as Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, existing methods often require additional training or neural function evaluations (NFEs), making them incompatible with guidance-distilled models. Also, they rely on heuristic approaches that need identifying target layers. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient method, termed PLADIS, which boosts pre-trained models (U-Net/Transformer) by leveraging sparse attention. Specifically, we extrapolate query-key correlations using softmax and its sparse counterpart in the cross-attention layer during inference, without requiring extra training or NFEs. By leveraging the noise robustness of sparse attention, our PLADIS unleashes the latent potential of text-to-image diffusion models, enabling them to excel in areas where they once struggled with newfound effectiveness. It integrates seamlessly with guidance techniques, including guidance-distilled models. Extensive experiments show notable improvements in text alignment and human preference, offering a highly efficient and universally applicable solution.

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving collaborative model training paradigm without sharing raw data. However, recent studies have revealed that private information can still be leaked through shared gradient information and attacked by Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIA). While many GIA methods have been proposed, a detailed analysis, evaluation, and summary of these methods are still lacking. Although various survey papers summarize existing privacy attacks in FL, few studies have conducted extensive experiments to unveil the effectiveness of GIA and their associated limiting factors in this context. To fill this gap, we first undertake a systematic review of GIA and categorize existing methods into three types, i.e., optimization-based GIA (OP-GIA), generation-based GIA (GEN-GIA), and analytics-based GIA (ANA-GIA). Then, we comprehensively analyze and evaluate the three types of GIA in FL, providing insights into the factors that influence their performance, practicality, and potential threats. Our findings indicate that OP-GIA is the most practical attack setting despite its unsatisfactory performance, while GEN-GIA has many dependencies and ANA-GIA is easily detectable, making them both impractical. Finally, we offer a three-stage defense pipeline to users when designing FL frameworks and protocols for better privacy protection and share some future research directions from the perspectives of attackers and defenders that we believe should be pursued. We hope that our study can help researchers design more robust FL frameworks to defend against these attacks.

Camera control has been actively studied in text or image conditioned video generation tasks. However, altering camera trajectories of a given video remains under-explored, despite its importance in the field of video creation. It is non-trivial due to the extra constraints of maintaining multiple-frame appearance and dynamic synchronization. To address this, we present ReCamMaster, a camera-controlled generative video re-rendering framework that reproduces the dynamic scene of an input video at novel camera trajectories. The core innovation lies in harnessing the generative capabilities of pre-trained text-to-video models through a simple yet powerful video conditioning mechanism -- its capability often overlooked in current research. To overcome the scarcity of qualified training data, we construct a comprehensive multi-camera synchronized video dataset using Unreal Engine 5, which is carefully curated to follow real-world filming characteristics, covering diverse scenes and camera movements. It helps the model generalize to in-the-wild videos. Lastly, we further improve the robustness to diverse inputs through a meticulously designed training strategy. Extensive experiments tell that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines. Our method also finds promising applications in video stabilization, super-resolution, and outpainting. Project page: https://jianhongbai.github.io/ReCamMaster/

Large language models (LLMs) have evolved beyond simple text generation to power software agents that directly translate natural language commands into tangible actions. While API-based LLM agents initially rose to prominence for their robust automation capabilities and seamless integration with programmatic endpoints, recent progress in multimodal LLM research has enabled GUI-based LLM agents that interact with graphical user interfaces in a human-like manner. Although these two paradigms share the goal of enabling LLM-driven task automation, they diverge significantly in architectural complexity, development workflows, and user interaction models.   This paper presents the first comprehensive comparative study of API-based and GUI-based LLM agents, systematically analyzing their divergence and potential convergence. We examine key dimensions and highlight scenarios in which hybrid approaches can harness their complementary strengths. By proposing clear decision criteria and illustrating practical use cases, we aim to guide practitioners and researchers in selecting, combining, or transitioning between these paradigms. Ultimately, we indicate that continuing innovations in LLM-based automation are poised to blur the lines between API- and GUI-driven agents, paving the way for more flexible, adaptive solutions in a wide range of real-world applications.

We examine key dimensions and highlight scenarios in which hybrid approaches can harness their complementary strengths. By proposing clear decision criteria and illustrating practical use cases, we aim to guide practitioners and researchers in selecting, combining, or transitioning between these paradigms. Ultimately, we indicate that continuing innovations in LLM-based automation are poised to blur the lines between API- and GUI-driven agents, paving the way for more flexible, adaptive solutions in a wide range of real-world applications."

Video Detailed Captioning (VDC) is a crucial task for vision-language bridging, enabling fine-grained descriptions of complex video content. In this paper, we first comprehensively benchmark current state-of-the-art approaches and systematically identified two critical limitations: biased capability towards specific captioning aspect and misalignment with human preferences. To address these deficiencies, we propose Cockatiel, a novel three-stage training pipeline that ensembles synthetic and human-aligned training for improving VDC performance. In the first stage, we derive a scorer from a meticulously annotated dataset to select synthetic captions high-performing on certain fine-grained video-caption alignment and human-preferred while disregarding others. Then, we train Cockatiel-13B, using this curated dataset to infuse it with assembled model strengths and human preferences. Finally, we further distill Cockatiel-8B from Cockatiel-13B for the ease of usage. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments reflect the effectiveness of our method, as we not only set new state-of-the-art performance on VDCSCORE in a dimension-balanced way but also surpass leading alternatives on human preference by a large margin as depicted by the human evaluation results.
