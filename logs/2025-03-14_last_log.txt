Toxicity in bug report discussions poses significant challenges to the collaborative dynamics of open-source software development. Bug reports are crucial for identifying and resolving defects, yet their inherently problem-focused nature and emotionally charged context make them susceptible to toxic interactions. This study explores toxicity in GitHub bug reports through a qualitative analysis of 203 bug threads, including 81 toxic ones. Our findings reveal that toxicity frequently arises from misaligned perceptions of bug severity and priority, unresolved frustrations with tools, and lapses in professional communication. These toxic interactions not only derail productive discussions but also reduce the likelihood of actionable outcomes, such as linking issues with pull requests. Our preliminary findings offer actionable recommendations to improve bug resolution by mitigating toxicity.

Авторы провели качественный анализ 203 веток обсуждения ошибок на GitHub, включая 81 токсичную. Результаты показывают, что токсичность часто возникает из-за расхождений в восприятии серьезности и приоритетности ошибок, нерешенных проблем с инструментами и нарушений профессиональной коммуникации. Токсичные взаимодействия не только нарушают продуктивные обсуждения, но и снижают вероятность достижения конкретных результатов, таких как привязка проблем к запросам на слияние.",
