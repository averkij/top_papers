Text:"CoSTA: Cost-Sensitive Toolpath Agent for Multi-turn Image Editing Advait Gupta NandaKiran Velaga Dang Nguyen Tianyi Zhou University of Maryland, College Park {advait25,nvelaga,dangmn,tianyi}@umd.edu Project: https://github.com/tianyi-lab/CoSTAR 5 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 3 1 6 0 1 . 3 0 5 2 : r Abstract Text-to-image models like stable diffusion and DALLE-3 still struggle with multi-turn image editing. We decompose such task as an agentic workflow (path) of tool use that addresses sequence of subtasks by AI tools of varying costs. Conventional search algorithms require expensive exploration to find tool paths. While large language models (LLMs) possess prior knowledge of subtask planning, they may lack accurate estimations of capabilities and costs of tools to determine which to apply in each subtask. Can we combine the strengths of both LLMs and graph search to find cost-efficient tool paths? We propose threestage approach CoSTA that leverages LLMs to create subtask tree, which helps prune graph of AI tools for the given task, and then conducts search on the small subgraph to find tool path. To better balance the total cost and quality, CoSTA combines both metrics of each tool on every subtask to guide the search. Each subtasks output is then evaluated by visionlanguage model (VLM), where failure will trigger an update of the tools cost and quality on the subtask. Hence, the search can recover from failures quickly to explore other paths. Moreover, CoSTA can automatically switch between modalities across subtasks for better cost-quality tradeoff. We build novel benchmark of challenging multi-turn image editing, on which CoSTA outperforms state-of-the-art image-editing models or agents in terms of both cost and quality, and performs versatile trade-offs upon user preference. 1. Introduction Text-to-Image models such as stable diffusion, FLUX, and DALLE has been widely studied to replace humans on image-editing tasks, which are time-consuming due to various repetitive operati"

We visualize the flows learned by different algorithms using the 8gaussiansmoons dataset. We compare flow matching (FM), minibatch optimal transport FM (OT), and our proposed conditional optimal transport FM (C2OT) using one Euler step and an adaptive ODE solver, respectively. Below each plot, we show the 2-Wasserstein distance (lower is better; meanstd over 10 runs). For unconditional generation, OT achieves significantly straighter flows, outperforming FM. However, paradoxically, OT performs worse when conditions are introduced. This paper analyzes this degradation and finds that it occurs because optimal transport disregards conditions, leading to train-test gap. To address this, we propose simple fix (C2OT) that outperforms FM and OT in conditional generation. Abstract Minibatch optimal transport coupling straightens paths in unconditional flow matching. This leads to computationally less demanding inference as fewer integration steps and less complex numerical solvers can be employed when numerically solving an ordinary differential equation at test time. However, in the conditional setting, minibatch optimal transport falls short. This is because the default optimal transport mapping disregards conditions, resulting in conditionally skewed prior distribution during training. In contrast, at test time, we have no access to the skewed prior, and instead sample from the full, unbiased prior distributi"

Text:"2025-3- Sinuo Liu1,2, Chenyang Lyu1, Minghao Wu1, Longyue Wang1, Weihua Luo1, Kaifu Zhang1 1. MarcoPolo Team, Alibaba International Digital Commerce 2. University of Edinburgh Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), particularly those leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning (CoT), have opened brand new possibility for Machine Translation (MT). This position paper argues that LRMs substantially transformed traditional neural MT as well as LLMs-based MT paradigms by reframing translation as dynamic reasoning task that requires contextual, cultural, and linguistic understanding and reasoning. We identify three foundational shifts: 1) contextual coherence, where LRMs resolve ambiguities and preserve discourse structure through explicit reasoning over cross-sentence and complex context or even lack of context; 2) cultural intentionality, enabling models to adapt outputs by inferring speaker intent, audience expectations, and socio-linguistic norms; 3) self-reflection, LRMs can perform self-reflection during the inference time to correct the potential errors in translation especially extremely noisy cases, showing better robustness compared to simply mapping X->Y translation. We explore various scenarios in translation including stylized translation, document-level translation and multimodal translation by showcasing empirical examples that demonstrate the superiority of LRMs in translation. We also identify several interesting phenomenons for LRMs for MT including autopivot translation as well as the critical challenges such as over-localisation in translation and inference efficiency. In conclusion, we think that LRMs redefine translation systems not merely as text converters but as multilingual cognitive agents capable of reasoning about meaning beyond the text. This paradigm shift reminds us to think of problems in translation beyond traditional translation scenarios in much broader context with LRMs - what we can achieve on top of it. 5 2 0 2 3 ] .

INTRODUCTION The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled advancements across multiple communication modalities, including speech processing. Whisper is an automated speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI, designed for applications such as speech transcription, live translation, and captioning [18]. The model has been trained with 680,000 hours of audio data, far surpassing the magnitude of training data used for ASR models. Furthermore, as training data has been divvied into 97 total languages, Whisper is compatible to act as translation machine, frequently found to perform better than LLM-based ASR models [20]. This robust approach has made Whisper one of the leading ASR models in both research and practical applications, and allows Whisper to be amongst the top performers across many applications of speech processing, such as through translation, transcription, speech recognition, and zero-shot evaluation [17]. Additionally, due to Whispers open support for quantization e.g whispercpp lightweight model with built in quantization features, it led me to use Whisper as the focus of this study [2]. Currently, Whisper contains ﬁve versions: tiny, small, base, medium, and large. Due to its accuracy and easy of use, Whisper is becoming increasingly popular in both larger model variants exhibit research and commercial applications [12]. However, these models are not always accurate when transcribing speech, and some transcriptions have been found to contain hallucinations. increased latency Moreover, and computational demands, making deployment on resourceconstrained devices more challenging. [10] ﬁnd that roughly 1% of audio transcriptions by Whisper contained entire hallucinated phrases or sentences, while also ﬁnding 38% of hallucinations included harms such as violence, inaccuracies or false authority. While prior research has explored ﬁne-tuning strategies to enhance Whispers performance [6], [8], [11], [12], [14], [19], [21], the impact of quantization on model size reduction and latency optimization remains underexplored. A. Contributions and Organization This paper addresses this research gap with few contributions: Evaluating the capabilities of Whisper and 2 variants: Whisper_Streaming & whisper-timestamped, with an emphasis on their similarities and differences. Establishing and deﬁning quantization techniques and relevant hardware considerations applicable to Whisper models. qualitative review on usage between the Whisper and Whisper_Streaming & whisper-timestamped Examining model performance in terms of word error rate, processing speed, and latency, relative to model size, version, runtime, and quantization approach. Summarizing both qualitative and quantitative results from two experimental evaluations. describe current research results and limitations in Sec. II. Sec. III qualitatively compares Whisper and its two variants. In Sec. IV, conduct model performance experiment, followed by discussion of qualitative results in Sec. V. Sec. VI compares the Whisper base model size with its performance on the LibriSpeech audio dataset. Sec. VII introduces quantization and its applications for Whisper, while Sec. VIII compares the performance of whispercpp based on run type and quantization method. Sec. IX evaluates the impact of three quantization methods on whispercpps accuracy, latency, and model size. Finally, Sec. discusses the practical applications of this research, with conclusion in Sec. XI. B. Note on Naming Conventions In this work, explore several variants of the Whisper model. The naming conventions across these variants, developed by external organizations or individuals, are inconsistent, with some adopting different conventions: Whisper: Standard model developed by OpenAI whispercpp: C++ implementation of the Whisper model whisper-timestamped: Version with added timestamping functionality Whisper Streaming: Version adapted for streaming For consistency in this document, will refer to these variants using the most common or descriptive form of the name. Please note that the developers may use different naming conventions across various implementations. II. LITERATURE REVIEW So far, several studies have been conducted on quantizing LLMs and ASR speech transcription. [17] evaluate the Whisper model, describing it as an encoder-decoder transformer model, in which decoder predicts corresponding text caption for each audio segment. They also note that Whisper was trained on large and diverse dataset, which explains why its performance on speciﬁc dataset may not be as high as model trained on only one kind [17]. [20] evaluate Whisper model capabilities, and contrast it with LLM-based ASR models. [20] explain how LLM-based ASR models use speech encoder to process speech and generate embeddings which are passed into decoder-only LLM. In their experimentation, they ﬁnd that the performan"

Text:"Shifting Long-Context LLMs Research from Input to Output Yuhao Wu 1 Yushi Bai 2 Zhiqing Hu 1 Shangqing Tu 2 Ming Shan Hee 1 Juanzi Li 2 Roy Ka-Wei Lee 1 5 2 0 2 7 ] . [ 2 3 2 7 4 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r aRecent advancements in long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) have primarily concentrated on processing extended input contexts, resulting in significant strides in long-context comprehension. However, the equally critical aspect of generating long-form outputs has received comparatively less attention. This paper advocates for paradigm shift in NLP research towards addressing the challenges of long-output generation. Tasks such as novel writing, long-term planning, and complex reasoning require models to understand extensive contexts and produce coherent, contextually rich, and logically consistent extended text. These demands highlight critical gap in current LLM capabilities. We underscore the importance of this under-explored domain and call for focused efforts to develop foundational LLMs tailored for generating high-quality, longform outputs, which hold immense potential for real-world applications. 1. Introduction Advancements in Long-Context LLMs (Inputs). Research on long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) has progressed rapidly in recent years, particularly in expanding context window lengths. These have grown from an initial 8K tokens to as much as 128K or even 1M tokens (OpenAI, 2024a; Anthropic, 2024; Reid et al., 2024b; GLM et al., 2024; Dubey et al., 2024). This dramatic expansion has enabled significant improvements in performance across long-context benchmarks (Kamradt, 2023; Bai et al., 2024b; Hsieh et al., 2024), unlocking new possibilities for real-world applications. Such advancements facilitate enhanced long-document and multi-document retrieval and more nuanced text comprehension tasks. For example, applications like summarizing lengthy reports, answering questions based on entire books, and analyzing multi-chapter 1Singapore University 2Tsinghua University. Lee <roy lee@sutd.edu.sg>. of Technology and Design Correspondence to: Roy Ka-Wei Figure 1. Difference between long-input and long-output LLMs. documents are now increasingly viable (Bai et al., 2024b; An et al., 2024a; Hsieh et al., 2024; Vodrahalli et al., 2024; Reid et al., 2024b). Consequently, the ability to process extended text has evolved from specialized feature into fundamental capability of state-of-the-art LLMs. The Case for Prioritizing Long Output. While the focus on long-context LLMs has primarily centered on processing extended input contexts, comparatively less attention has been given to long-output generation. This is surprising, given the growing number of applications requiring extended, coherent, and contextually rich text. Recent studies reveal significant performance limitations in existing models when tasked with generating long-form content beyond thousands of words (Wu et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2024d; Ye et al., 2025; Tu et al., 2025). This paper advocates for shift in research priorities for foundational LLMs, urging researchers to focus on this relatively unexplored area of long text generation. Several real-world applications, such as novel writing, long-term planning, and complex reasoning, require generating long texts exceeding 4,000 tokens (approximately 2,600 words) for successful task completion. Despite their importance, these applications have been significantly overlooked. These applications demand models capable of processing extensive contexts while producing high-quality, logically consistent outputs. We define these 1 models, optimized for long-output tasks, as long-output LLMs (see Figure 1). foundational long-output LLMs could be an immensely rewarding and exciting opportunity for many researchers and workflow. Why Long-Output LLMs have been Overlooked? The limited progress in long-output generation can be attributed to three primary challenges. ① Data limitations pose significant obstacle. Existing datasets for instruction-following tasks are predominantly composed of short input-output pairs, with only limited number of high-quality datasets featuring long output sequences (Bai et al., 2024a; Xiong et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023). This scarcity of suitable data constrains both research and the practical application of long-output models. ② Task execution complexities add further difficulty. Generating long-form content, particularly for creative and structured tasks such as novel writing or article composition, requires models to maintain coherence and logical consistency across extended contexts. This level of complexity is significantly greater than what is required for shorter tasks (Wu et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Tan et al., 2024). ③ Computational cost constraints present substantial hurdle. The computational demand for generating long texts increases linearly in certain architectures (Gu & Dao, 2023; Dao et al., 2022). Furthermore, proprietary models often impose token limits (e.g., 4,096 or 8,192 tokens) (OpenAI, n.d.; Anthropic, 2024; Reid et al., 2024a), restricting their capacity to generate extended outputs. These combined challenges highlight the need for more targeted research and innovation to advance long-output LLM capabilities. Why Care about the Long Output Domain? Addressing the challenges of long-output LLMs is crucial for meeting real-world needs across various domains. ① Fields, such as healthcare, law, education, and media depend on long-form content for tasks such as generating research papers, drafting legal documents, and preparing detailed reports (Zhao et al., 2024b; Chiang et al., 2024). Long-output LLMs can bridge the gap in these areas by automating the production of coherent, high-quality content, thereby streamlining workflows. ② Enhancing creativity and productivity is another key benefit. Long-output LLMs facilitate the co-authoring of extensive works such as novels and academic papers, reducing the time and effort required for content creation. This allows professionals to allocate more attention to higherlevel tasks like analysis and ideation (Atmakuru et al., 2024; Chiang et al., 2024). ③ Advancing complex reasoning is critical contribution of these models. By exploring larger output spaces and enhancing capabilities in summarization and inference, long-output LLMs enable deeper analysis and support intricate reasoning processes. Together, these advancements underscore the transformative potential of long-output LLM"

Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown promise for embodied task planning, yet they struggle with fundamental challenges like dependency constraints and efficiency. Existing approaches either solely optimize action selection or leverage world models during inference, overlooking the benefits of learning to model the world as a way to enhance planning capabilities. We propose Dual Preference Optimization (D^2PO), a new learning framework that jointly optimizes state prediction and action selection through preference learning, enabling LVLMs to understand environment dynamics for better planning. To automatically collect trajectories and stepwise preference data without human annotation, we introduce a tree search mechanism for extensive exploration via trial-and-error. Extensive experiments on VoTa-Bench demonstrate that our D^2PO-based method significantly outperforms existing methods and GPT-4o when applied to Qwen2-VL (7B), LLaVA-1.6 (7B), and LLaMA-3.2 (11B), achieving superior task success rates with more efficient execution paths.

Vision-Language Models have made significant progress on many perception-focused tasks, however, their progress on reasoning-focused tasks seem to be limited due to the lack of high-quality and diverse training data. In this work, we aim to address the scarcity issue of reasoning-focused multimodal datasets. We propose VisualWebInstruct - a novel approach that leverages search engine to create a diverse, and high-quality dataset spanning multiple disciplines like math, physics, finance, chemistry, etc. Starting with meticulously selected 30,000 seed images, we employ Google Image search to identify websites containing similar images. We collect and process the HTMLs from over 700K unique URL sources. Through a pipeline of content extraction, filtering and synthesis, we build a dataset of approximately 900K question-answer pairs, with 40% being visual QA pairs and the rest as text QA pairs. Models fine-tuned on VisualWebInstruct demonstrate significant performance gains: (1) training from Llava-OV-mid shows 10-20% absolute point gains across benchmarks, (2) training from MAmmoTH-VL shows 5% absoluate gain. Our best model MAmmoTH-VL2 shows state-of-the-art performance within the 10B parameter class on MMMU-Pro-std (40.7%), MathVerse (42.6%), and DynaMath (55.7%). These remarkable results highlight the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing VLMs' reasoning capabilities for complex multimodal tasks.

In this paper, we propose a general framework for universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation. Existing zero-shot methods build inference framework upon large language models (LLM) for specific tasks, which differs a lot in overall pipeline and fails to generalize across different types of goal. Towards the aim of universal zero-shot navigation, we propose a uniform graph representation to unify different goals, including object category, instance image and text description. We also convert the observation of agent into an online maintained scene graph. With this consistent scene and goal representation, we preserve most structural information compared with pure text and are able to leverage LLM for explicit graph-based reasoning. Specifically, we conduct graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph at each time instant and propose different strategies to generate long-term goal of exploration according to different matching states. The agent first iteratively searches subgraph of goal when zero-matched. With partial matching, the agent then utilizes coordinate projection and anchor pair alignment to infer the goal location. Finally scene graph correction and goal verification are applied for perfect matching. We also present a blacklist mechanism to enable robust switch between stages. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our UniGoal achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on three studied navigation tasks with a single model, even outperforming task-specific zero-shot methods and supervised universal methods.

Text-to-image models like stable diffusion and DALLE-3 still struggle with multi-turn image editing. We decompose such a task as an agentic workflow (path) of tool use that addresses a sequence of subtasks by AI tools of varying costs. Conventional search algorithms require expensive exploration to find tool paths. While large language models (LLMs) possess prior knowledge of subtask planning, they may lack accurate estimations of capabilities and costs of tools to determine which to apply in each subtask. Can we combine the strengths of both LLMs and graph search to find cost-efficient tool paths? We propose a three-stage approach "CoSTA*" that leverages LLMs to create a subtask tree, which helps prune a graph of AI tools for the given task, and then conducts A* search on the small subgraph to find a tool path. To better balance the total cost and quality, CoSTA* combines both metrics of each tool on every subtask to guide the A* search. Each subtask's output is then evaluated by a vision-language model (VLM), where a failure will trigger an update of the tool's cost and quality on the subtask. Hence, the A* search can recover from failures quickly to explore other paths. Moreover, CoSTA* can automatically switch between modalities across subtasks for a better cost-quality trade-off. We build a novel benchmark of challenging multi-turn image editing, on which CoSTA* outperforms state-of-the-art image-editing models or agents in terms of both cost and quality, and performs versatile trade-offs upon user preference.

Minibatch optimal transport coupling straightens paths in unconditional flow matching. This leads to computationally less demanding inference as fewer integration steps and less complex numerical solvers can be employed when numerically solving an ordinary differential equation at test time. However, in the conditional setting, minibatch optimal transport falls short. This is because the default optimal transport mapping disregards conditions, resulting in a conditionally skewed prior distribution during training. In contrast, at test time, we have no access to the skewed prior, and instead sample from the full, unbiased prior distribution. This gap between training and testing leads to a subpar performance. To bridge this gap, we propose conditional optimal transport C^2OT that adds a conditional weighting term in the cost matrix when computing the optimal transport assignment. Experiments demonstrate that this simple fix works with both discrete and continuous conditions in 8gaussians-to-moons, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-32x32, and ImageNet-256x256. Our method performs better overall compared to the existing baselines across different function evaluation budgets. Code is available at https://hkchengrex.github.io/C2OT

To bridge this gap, we propose conditional optimal transport C^2OT that adds a conditional weighting term in the cost matrix when computing the optimal transport assignment. Experiments demonstrate that this simple fix works with both discrete and continuous conditions in 8gaussians-to-moons, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-32x32, and ImageNet-256x256. Our method performs better overall compared to the existing baselines across different function evaluation budgets. Code is available at https://hkchengrex.github.io/C2OT"

Video generation has witnessed remarkable progress with the advent of deep generative models, particularly diffusion models. While existing methods excel in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or single images, personalized multi-subject video generation remains a largely unexplored challenge. This task involves synthesizing videos that incorporate multiple distinct subjects, each defined by separate reference images, while ensuring temporal and spatial consistency. Current approaches primarily rely on mapping subject images to keywords in text prompts, which introduces ambiguity and limits their ability to model subject relationships effectively. In this paper, we propose CINEMA, a novel framework for coherent multi-subject video generation by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach eliminates the need for explicit correspondences between subject images and text entities, mitigating ambiguity and reducing annotation effort. By leveraging MLLM to interpret subject relationships, our method facilitates scalability, enabling the use of large and diverse datasets for training. Furthermore, our framework can be conditioned on varying numbers of subjects, offering greater flexibility in personalized content creation. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves subject consistency, and overall video coherence, paving the way for advanced applications in storytelling, interactive media, and personalized video generation.

Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), particularly those leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning (CoT), have opened brand new possibility for Machine Translation (MT). This position paper argues that LRMs substantially transformed traditional neural MT as well as LLMs-based MT paradigms by reframing translation as a dynamic reasoning task that requires contextual, cultural, and linguistic understanding and reasoning. We identify three foundational shifts: 1) contextual coherence, where LRMs resolve ambiguities and preserve discourse structure through explicit reasoning over cross-sentence and complex context or even lack of context; 2) cultural intentionality, enabling models to adapt outputs by inferring speaker intent, audience expectations, and socio-linguistic norms; 3) self-reflection, LRMs can perform self-reflection during the inference time to correct the potential errors in translation especially extremely noisy cases, showing better robustness compared to simply mapping X->Y translation. We explore various scenarios in translation including stylized translation, document-level translation and multimodal translation by showcasing empirical examples that demonstrate the superiority of LRMs in translation. We also identify several interesting phenomenons for LRMs for MT including auto-pivot translation as well as the critical challenges such as over-localisation in translation and inference efficiency. In conclusion, we think that LRMs redefine translation systems not merely as text converters but as multilingual cognitive agents capable of reasoning about meaning beyond the text. This paradigm shift reminds us to think of problems in translation beyond traditional translation scenarios in a much broader context with LRMs - what we can achieve on top of it.

Automated speech recognition (ASR) models have gained prominence for applications such as captioning, speech translation, and live transcription. This paper studies Whisper and two model variants: one optimized for live speech streaming and another for offline transcription. Notably, these models have been found to generate hallucinated content, reducing transcription reliability. Furthermore, larger model variants exhibit increased latency and pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This study analyzes the similarities and differences between three Whisper models, qualitatively examining their distinct capabilities. Next, this study quantifies the impact of model quantization on latency and evaluates its viability for edge deployment. Using the open source LibriSpeech dataset, this paper evaluates the word error rate (WER) along with latency analysis of whispercpp using 3 quantization methods (INT4, INT5, INT8). Results show that quantization reduces latency by 19\% and model size by 45\%, while preserving transcription accuracy. These findings provide insights into the optimal use cases of different Whisper models and edge device deployment possibilities.

"Automated speech recognition (ASR) models have gained prominence for applications such as captioning, speech translation, and live transcription. This paper studies Whisper and two model variants: one optimized for live speech streaming and another for offline transcription. Notably, these models have been found to generate hallucinated content, reducing transcription reliability. Furthermore, larger model variants exhibit increased latency and pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This study analyzes the similarities and differences between three Whisper models, qualitatively examining their distinct capabilities. Next, this study quantifies the impact of model quantization on latency and evaluates its viability for edge deployment. Using the open source LibriSpeech dataset, this paper evaluates the word error rate (WER) along with latency analysis of whispercpp using 3 quantization methods (INT4, INT5, INT8). Results show that quantization reduces latency by 19\% and model size by 45\%, while preserving transcription accuracy. These findings provide insights into the optimal use cases of different Whisper models and edge device deployment possibilities. All code, datasets, and implementation details are available in a public GitHub repository: https://github.com/allisonandreyev/WhisperQuantization.git"

Recent advancements in long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) have primarily concentrated on processing extended input contexts, resulting in significant strides in long-context comprehension. However, the equally critical aspect of generating long-form outputs has received comparatively less attention. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift in NLP research toward addressing the challenges of long-output generation. Tasks such as novel writing, long-term planning, and complex reasoning require models to understand extensive contexts and produce coherent, contextually rich, and logically consistent extended text. These demands highlight a critical gap in current LLM capabilities. We underscore the importance of this under-explored domain and call for focused efforts to develop foundational LLMs tailored for generating high-quality, long-form outputs, which hold immense potential for real-world applications.
