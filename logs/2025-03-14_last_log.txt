Control Distillation: (d) Control methods like Concept sliders can be transferred from base model to distilled models, effectively distilling controlDistilled diffusion models suffer from critical limitation: reduced sample diversity compared to their base counterparts. In this work, we uncover that despite this diversity loss, distilled models retain the fundamental concept representations of base models. We demonstrate control distillation - where control mechanisms like Concept Sliders and LoRAs trained on base models can be seamlessly transferred to distilled models and vice-versa, effectively distilling control without any retraining. This preservation of representational structure prompted our investigation into the mechanisms of diversity collapse during distillation. To understand how distillation affects diversity, we introduce Diffusion Target (DT) Visualization, an analysis and debugging tool that reveals how models predict final outputs at intermediate steps. Through DT-Visualization, we identify generation artifacts, inconsistencies, and demonstrate that initial diffusion timesteps disproportionately determine output diversity, while later steps primarily refine details. Based on these insights, we introduce diversity distillation - hybrid inference approach that strategically employs the base model for only the first critical timestep before transitioning to the efficient distilled model. Our experiments demonstrate that this simple modification not only restores the diversity capabilities from base to distilled models but surprisingly exceeds it, while maintaining nearly the computational efficiency of distilled inference, all without requiring additional training or model modifications. Our code and data are available at distillation.baulab.info 1. Introduction Distilled diffusion models generate images in far fewer timesteps but lack the sample diversity of their original base model counterparts. In this paper we ask: How can we distill both diversity and control capabilities from base diffusion models to their efficient distilled variants? Diffusion models demonstrate unprecedented quality [4, 13, 17, 24, 25], but their computational demands, requiring dozens or hundreds of sequential denoising steps, present significant deployment challenges. Diffusion distillation techniques [17, 18, 21, 29, 34, 35] address this by modifying base model weights to reduce required inference steps. However, this efficiency comes at critical cost: mode colCorrespondence to gandikota.ro@northeastern.edu 1 lapse, where different initial noise seeds produce visually similar outputs, creating fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and generation diversity. Our analysis reveals surprising property: distilled diffusion models maintain consistent concept representations with their base counterparts, independent of the distillation procedure. We empirically verify this through concept transfer experiments, where control mechanisms like Concept Sliders [8, 10], LoRA adaptations [14, 16, 26] that are trained on base models can be seamlessly applied to distilled variants and vice versa without retraining. This preservation of representational structure despite the model weights modification suggests that the fundamental capabilities of base models remain intact in their distilled versions, enabling form of CONTROL DISTILLATION from base to efficient models. This raises an intriguing question: if representations are preserved, why does diversity collapse during distillation? To answer this question, we introduce novel analysis and debugging technique called DT-Visualization (Diffusion Target) that reveals what diffusion model thinks the final image will be at any intermediate timestep. Through DT-Visualization, we conduct detailed analysis of latent representations across timesteps and discover that the initial diffusion steps disproportionately determine structural composition and diversity, while subsequent steps primarily refine details. This critical insight connects our findings: while distilled models preserve concept representations, they fail to maintain the diversity-generating behavior of early timesteps, affecting both sample-level variation and distribution-level coverage. This observation motivates simple hybrid inference approach that achieves DIVERSITY DISTILLATION by strategically employing the base model for only the first critical timestep before transitioning to the distilled model for efficient completion of the generation process. By leveraging the representational compatibility between models, this approach aims to directly address the mode collapse in distilled models during the diversity-critical early denoising steps. Our experimental results reveal counterintuitive finding: this hybrid approach not only restores the diversity lost during distillation but exceeds the diversity of the original base model while maintaining nearly the computational efficiency of distilled inference. These results demonstrate that the traditional trade-off between computational efficiency and generation diversity can be mitigated through timestep-specific model selection. This work has implications for both theoretical understanding of diffusion model distillation and practical applications in model deployment. 2. Related Works Diffusion Distillation: While diffusion models [13, 30, 31] excel at high-quality image synthesis, their requirement for 20-100 sampling steps creates significant computational bottlenecks. Diffusion distillation techniques address this limitation by finetuning base models that maintain quality with fewer steps. Progressive distillation [27] established the foundation by iteratively training student models to match teacher outputs with half the sampling steps. Recent approaches have further improved efficiency through distinct methodologies: Adversarial Diffusion Distillation [29], implemented in SDXL-Turbo, integrates score distillation with adversarial training to enable high-fidelity generation in just 1-4 steps, effectively combining diffusion guidance with GAN-like discriminators.

Text:"Open-Sora 2.0: Training Commercial-Level Video Generation Model in $200k Open-Sora Team HPC-AI TechVideo generation models have achieved remarkable progress in the past year. The quality of AI video continues to improve, but at the cost of larger model size, increased data quantity, and greater demand for training compute. In this report, we present Open-Sora 2.0, commercial-level video generation model trained for only $200k. With this model, we demonstrate that the cost of training topperforming video generation model is highly controllable. We detail all techniques that contribute to this efficiency breakthrough, including data curation, model architecture, training strategy, and system optimization. According to human evaluation results and VBench scores, Open-Sora 2.0 is comparable to global leading video generation models including the open-source HunyuanVideo and the closed-source Runway Gen-3 Alpha. By making Open-Sora 2.0 fully open-source, we aim to democratize access to advanced video generation technology, fostering broader innovation and creativity in content creation.

[ 1 2 4 6 9 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Human preference evaluation of Open-Sora 2.0 against other leading video generation models. Win rate represents the percentage of comparisons where our model was preferred over the competing model. The evaluation is conducted on 100 prompts carefully designed to cover three key aspects: 1) visual quality, 2) prompt adherence, and 3) motion quality. Results show that our model performs favorably against other top-performing models in all three aspects. Technical Report. The past year has witnessed an explosion of video generation models. Since the emergence of OpenAIs Sora [4] in February 2024, series of video generation modelseither open-source [16, 19, 22, 27, 43] or proprietary [26, 31, 34]have appeared at an unprecedented pace, each striving to achieve "Sora-level" generation quality. While the quality of generated videos continues to improve, there is clear trend toward rapid growth in model size, data quantity, and computing resources. Following the success of scaling large language models (LLMs) [15, 18], researchers are now applying similar scaling principles [19] to video generation, converging on similar model architectures and training techniques. In this report, however, we show that top-performing video generation model can be trained at highly controlled cost, offering new insights into cost-effective training and efficiency optimization.. We build Open-Sora 2.0, commercial-level video generation model trained for only $200k. As shown in Table. 4, the training cost is 5-10 times lower than comparable models like MovieGen [31] and Step-Video-T2V [27] based on fair comparison. This remarkable cost efficiency stems from our joint optimization of data curation, training strategy, and AI infrastructureall of which are detailed in the following sections. We show the human preference evaluation of Open-Sora 2.0 and other global leading video generation models in Figure 1. The models for comparison include proprietary models like Runway Gen-3 Alpha [34], Luma Ray2 [26] and open-source models like HunyuanVideo [19] and Step-VideoT2V [27]. We evaluate these models in three important aspects: 1) visual quality, 2) prompt adherence, and 3) motion quality. Despite the low cost of our model, it outperforms these top-performing models in at least two aspects out of the three, demonstrating its strong potential for commercial deployment. This report is structured as follows. In Section 2, we elaborate on our data strategy, including our hierarchical data filtering system and annotation methods. Section 3 details our model architecture, covering both our novel Video DC-AE autoencoder design and the DiT architecture. Section 4 explores our cost-effective training methodology, which enables commercial-level quality at just $200k. Section 5 presents our conditioning approaches, including image-to-video and motion control techniques. Section 6 outlines the system optimizations that maximize training efficiency, and Section 7 evaluates our models performance against leading video generation models. Finally, we conclude with summary of our contributions and insights for future research.Our goal for data is to build hierarchical data pyramid, catering to the requirement of the progressive training process. To this end, we develop collection of filters that function distinctly from each other, aiming to tackle various types of data detections. By progressively strengthening the degree of filtration, we can obtain subsets of smaller sizes but higher purity and quality. In Section 2.1, we first elaborate the data filtering system that consists of two main components: preprocessing and score filtering. Then, we introduce data annotation methods in Section 2.2. Finally, we present detailed statistics of the whole dataset in Section 2.3. 2.1 Data Filtering The hierarchical data filtering system is illustrated in Figure 2. We begin by preprocessing raw videos into trainable video clips, then progressively apply series of filters, ranging from loose to strict, to construct structured data pyramid. 2.1.1 Preprocessing The preprocessing phase converts raw videos into short clips suitable for training. During this phase, we first eliminate broken files and raw videos with outlying attributes. Specifically, we filter out videos with duration of less than 2 seconds, bit per pixel (bpp) below 0.02, frame rate (fps) under 16, and an aspect ratio outside the range [1/3, 3], and those with "Constrained Baseline" profile. Then, we detect continuous shots within the raw video and segment it into short clips based on the detection result. For shot detection, we apply the libavfilter from FFmpeg [12] to calculate the scene scores, which quantify visual differences among frames. The shot boundaries are identified at points where the change in scene scores exceeds an empirically determined threshold. 2 Figure 2: The hierarchical data filtering pipeline. The raw videos are first transformed into trainable video clips. Then, we apply various complimentary score filters to obtain data subsets for each training stage. Finally, we segment the video based on the shot detection results, ensuring that the output clips adhere to specific format constraints: frame rate (fps) below 30, longer dimension not exceed"

Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality contents from text prompts. However, their reliance on publicly available data and the growing trend of data sharing for fine-tuning make these models particularly vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce the Silent Branding Attack, a novel data poisoning method that manipulates text-to-image diffusion models to generate images containing specific brand logos or symbols without any text triggers. We find that when certain visual patterns are repeatedly in the training data, the model learns to reproduce them naturally in its outputs, even without prompt mentions. Leveraging this, we develop an automated data poisoning algorithm that unobtrusively injects logos into original images, ensuring they blend naturally and remain undetected. Models trained on this poisoned dataset generate images containing logos without degrading image quality or text alignment. We experimentally validate our silent branding attack across two realistic settings on large-scale high-quality image datasets and style personalization datasets, achieving high success rates even without a specific text trigger. Human evaluation and quantitative metrics including logo detection show that our method can stealthily embed logos.

"Pixel grounding, encompassing tasks such as Referring Expression Segmentation (RES), has garnered considerable attention due to its immense potential for bridging the gap between vision and language modalities. However, advancements in this domain are currently constrained by limitations inherent in existing datasets, including limited object categories, insufficient textual diversity, and a scarcity of high-quality annotations. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce GroundingSuite, which comprises: (1) an automated data annotation framework leveraging multiple Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents; (2) a large-scale training dataset encompassing 9.56 million diverse referring expressions and their corresponding segmentations; and (3) a meticulously curated evaluation benchmark consisting of 3,800 images. The GroundingSuite training dataset facilitates substantial performance improvements, enabling models trained on it to achieve state-of-the-art results. Specifically, a cIoU of 68.9 on gRefCOCO and a gIoU of 55.3 on RefCOCOm. Moreover, the GroundingSuite annotation framework demonstrates superior efficiency compared to the current leading data annotation method, i.e., 4.5 times faster than the GLaMM."

Current image generation and editing methods primarily process textual prompts as direct inputs without reasoning about visual composition and explicit operations. We present Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT), a novel paradigm that enables generation and editing through an explicit language reasoning process before outputting images. This approach transforms conventional text-to-image generation and editing into a reasoning-guided framework that analyzes semantic relationships and spatial arrangements. We define the formulation of GoT and construct large-scale GoT datasets containing over 9M samples with detailed reasoning chains capturing semantic-spatial relationships. To leverage the advantages of GoT, we implement a unified framework that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for reasoning chain generation with an end-to-end diffusion model enhanced by our novel Semantic-Spatial Guidance Module. Experiments show our GoT framework achieves excellent performance on both generation and editing tasks, with significant improvements over baselines. Additionally, our approach enables interactive visual generation, allowing users to explicitly modify reasoning steps for precise image adjustments. GoT pioneers a new direction for reasoning-driven visual generation and editing, producing images that better align with human intent. To facilitate future research, we make our datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at https://github.com/rongyaofang/GoT.

Distilled diffusion models suffer from a critical limitation: reduced sample diversity compared to their base counterparts. In this work, we uncover that despite this diversity loss, distilled models retain the fundamental concept representations of base models. We demonstrate control distillation - where control mechanisms like Concept Sliders and LoRAs trained on base models can be seamlessly transferred to distilled models and vice-versa, effectively distilling control without any retraining. This preservation of representational structure prompted our investigation into the mechanisms of diversity collapse during distillation. To understand how distillation affects diversity, we introduce Diffusion Target (DT) Visualization, an analysis and debugging tool that reveals how models predict final outputs at intermediate steps. Through DT-Visualization, we identify generation artifacts, inconsistencies, and demonstrate that initial diffusion timesteps disproportionately determine output diversity, while later steps primarily refine details. Based on these insights, we introduce diversity distillation - a hybrid inference approach that strategically employs the base model for only the first critical timestep before transitioning to the efficient distilled model. Our experiments demonstrate that this simple modification not only restores the diversity capabilities from base to distilled models but surprisingly exceeds it, while maintaining nearly the computational efficiency of distilled inference, all without requiring additional training or model modifications.

We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables randomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel guided decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot tasks such as image inpainting, outpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.94 with only 64 sampling steps, achieving over a 20-fold increase in throughput while reducing memory consumption by over 75% compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale.

"We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables randomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel guided decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot tasks such as image inpainting, outpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.94 with only 64 sampling steps, achieving over a 20-fold increase in throughput while reducing memory consumption by over 75% compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale."

Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capability in complex textual tasks. However, multimodal reasoning, which requires integrating visual and textual information, remains a significant challenge. Existing visual-language models often struggle to effectively analyze and reason visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on complex reasoning tasks. Moreover, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks hinders the accurate assessment of multimodal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce R1-Onevision, a multimodal reasoning model designed to bridge the gap between visual perception and deep reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a cross-modal reasoning pipeline that transforms images into formal textural representations, enabling precise language-based reasoning. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct the R1-Onevision dataset which provides detailed, step-by-step multimodal reasoning annotations across diverse domains. We further develop the R1-Onevision model through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to cultivate advanced reasoning and robust generalization abilities. To comprehensively evaluate multimodal reasoning performance across different grades, we introduce R1-Onevision-Bench, a benchmark aligned with human educational stages, covering exams from junior high school to university and beyond. Experimental results show that R1-Onevision achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming models such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL on multiple challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks.

This paper presents our work on the Light-R1 series, with models, data, and code all released.   We first focus on training long COT models from scratch, specifically starting from models initially lacking long COT capabilities. Using a curriculum training recipe consisting of two-stage SFT and semi-on-policy DPO, we train our model Light-R1-32B from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, resulting in superior math performance compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B. Despite being trained exclusively on math data, Light-R1-32B shows strong generalization across other domains. In the subsequent phase of this work, we highlight the significant benefit of the 3k dataset constructed for the second SFT stage on enhancing other models. By fine-tuning DeepSeek-R1-Distilled models using this dataset, we obtain new SOTA models in 7B and 14B, while the 32B model, Light-R1-32B-DS performed comparably to QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1.   Furthermore, we extend our work by applying reinforcement learning, specifically GRPO, on long-COT models to further improve reasoning performance. We successfully train our final Light-R1-14B-DS with RL, achieving SOTA performance among 14B parameter models in math. With AIME24 & 25 scores of 74.0 and 60.2 respectively, Light-R1-14B-DS surpasses even many 32B models and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. Its RL training also exhibits well expected behavior, showing simultaneous increase in response length and reward score.   The Light-R1 series of work validates training long-COT models from scratch, showcases the art in SFT data and releases SOTA models from RL.

Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in the past year. The quality of AI video continues to improve, but at the cost of larger model size, increased data quantity, and greater demand for training compute. In this report, we present Open-Sora 2.0, a commercial-level video generation model trained for only $200k. With this model, we demonstrate that the cost of training a top-performing video generation model is highly controllable. We detail all techniques that contribute to this efficiency breakthrough, including data curation, model architecture, training strategy, and system optimization. According to human evaluation results and VBench scores, Open-Sora 2.0 is comparable to global leading video generation models including the open-source HunyuanVideo and the closed-source Runway Gen-3 Alpha. By making Open-Sora 2.0 fully open-source, we aim to democratize access to advanced video generation technology, fostering broader innovation and creativity in content creation. All resources are publicly available at: https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora.
