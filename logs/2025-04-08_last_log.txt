[ 1 4 0 3 5 0 . 4 0 5 2 : r aDiffusion models approximate the denoising distribution as Gaussian and predict its mean, whereas flow matching models reparameterize the Gaussian mean as flow velocity. However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce oversaturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where single Gaussian is learned with an L2 denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256256. 1. Introduction Diffusion probabilistic models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020), score-based models (Song & Ermon, 2019; Song et al., 2021b), and flow matching models (Lipman et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022) form family of generative models that share an underlying theoretical framework and 1Stanford University, CA 94305, USA 2Adobe Research, CA 95110, USA 3Hillbot. Correspondence to: Hansheng Chen <hanshengchen@stanford.edu.>. Preliminary work. Figure 1. Comparison between vanilla diffusion (with flow velocity parameterization) and GMFlow on 2D checkerboard distribution. (a) The vanilla diffusion model predicts mean velocity, modeling the denoising distribution qθ(x0xt) as single Gaussian, and then samples from Gaussian transition distribution qθ(xttxt). (b) GMFlow predicts GM for velocity and yields multi-modal GM denoising distribution, from which the transition distribution can be analytically derived for precise next-step sampling, allowing more accurate few-step sampling (4 steps in this case). have made significant advances in image and video generation (Yang et al., 2023; Po et al., 2024; Rombach et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022b; Podell et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Esser et al., 2024; Blattmann et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2023; HaCohen et al., 2024; Kong et al., 2025). Standard diffusion models approximate the denoising distribution as Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching Models Gaussian and train neural networks to predict its mean, and optionally its variance (Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021; Bao et al., 2022b;a). Flow matching models reparameterize the Gaussian mean as flow velocity, formulating an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that maps noise to data. These formulations remain dominant in image generation as per user studies (Artificial Analysis, 2025; Jiang et al., 2024). However, vanilla diffusion and flow models require tens of sampling steps for high-quality generation, since Gaussian approximations hold only for small step sizes, and numeric ODE integration introduces discretization errors. In addition, high quality generation requires higher classifier-free guidance (CFG) scale (Ho & Salimans, 2021), yet stronger CFG often leads to over-saturated colors (Saharia et al., 2022a; Kynkaanniemi et al., 2024) due to out-of-distribution (OOD) extrapolation (Bradley & Nakkiran, 2024), thus limiting overall image quality even with hundreds of steps. To address these limitations, we deviate from previous single-Gaussian assumption and introduce Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow). Unlike vanilla flow models, which predict the mean of flow velocity u, GMFlow predicts the parameters of Gaussian mixture (GM) distribution, representing the probability density function (PDF) of u. This provides two key benefits: (a) our GM formulation captures more intricate denoising distributions, enabling more accurate transition estimates at larger step sizes and thus requiring fewer steps for high-quality generation  (Fig. 1)  ; (b) CFG can be reformulated by reweighting the GM probabilities rather than extrapolation, thus bounding the samples within the conditional distribution and avoiding over-saturation, thereby improving overall image quality. We train GMFlow by minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted velocity distribution and the ground truth distribution, which we show is generalization of previous diffusion and flow matching models ( 3.1). For inference, we introduce novel SDE and ODE solvers that analytically derive the reverse transition distribution and flow velocity field from the predicted GM, enabling fast and precise few-step sampling ( 3.3). Meanwhile, we develop probabilistic guidance approach for conditional generation, which reweights the GM PDF using Gaussian mask to enhance condition alignment ( 3.2). For evaluation, we compare GMFlow against vanilla flow matching baselines on both 2D toy dataset and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). Extensive experiments reveal that GMFlow consistently outperforms baselines equipped with advanced solvers (Lu et al., 2022; 2023; Zhao et al., 2023; Karras et al., 2022). Notably, on ImageNet 256256, GMFlow excels in both Precision and FID metrics with fewer than 8 sampling steps; with 32 sampling steps, GMFlow achieves state-of-the-art Precision of 0.950  (Fig. 6)  . The main contributions of this paper are as follows: We propose GMFlow, generalized formulation of diffusion models based on GM denoising distributions. We introduce GM-based sampling framework consisting of novel SDE/ODE solvers and probabilistic guidance. We empirically validate that GMFlow outperforms flow matching baselines in both fewand many-step settings. 2. Diffusion and Flow Matching Models In this section, we provide background on diffusion and flow matching models as the basis for GMFlow. Note that we introduce flow matching as special diffusion parameterization since they largely overlap in practice (Albergo & Vanden-Eijnden, 2023; Gao et al., 2024). Forward diffusion process.

Region-level captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for specific image regions while highlighting their distinguishing features. However, existing methods struggle to produce unique captions across multi-granularity, limiting their real-world applicability. To address the need for detailed region-level understanding, we introduce URECA dataset, a large-scale dataset tailored for multi-granularity region captioning. Unlike prior datasets that focus primarily on salient objects, URECA dataset ensures a unique and consistent mapping between regions and captions by incorporating a diverse set of objects, parts, and background elements. Central to this is a stage-wise data curation pipeline, where each stage incrementally refines region selection and caption generation. By leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, our pipeline produces distinctive and contextually grounded captions with improved accuracy and semantic diversity. Building upon this dataset, we present URECA, a novel captioning model designed to effectively encode multi-granularity regions. URECA maintains essential spatial properties such as position and shape through simple yet impactful modifications to existing MLLMs, enabling fine-grained and semantically rich region descriptions. Our approach introduces dynamic mask modeling and a high-resolution mask encoder to enhance caption uniqueness. Experiments show that URECA achieves state-of-the-art performance on URECA dataset and generalizes well to existing region-level captioning benchmarks.

However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an L_2 denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256times256."
