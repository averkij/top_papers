Text:"5 2 0 2 5 ] . [ 1 2 2 0 4 0 . 4 0 5 2 : r Rethinking Reflection in Pre-Training Essential AI San Francisco, CA research@essential.aiA language models ability to reflect on its own reasoning provides key advantage for solving complex problems. While most recent research has focused on how this ability develops during reinforcement learning, we show that it actually begins to emerge much earlierduring the models pre-training. To study this, we introduce deliberate errors into chains-of-thought and test whether the model can still arrive at the correct answer by recognizing and correcting these mistakes. By tracking performance across different stages of pre-training, we observe that this self-correcting ability appears early and improves steadily over time. For instance, an OLMo-27B model pre-trained on 4 trillion tokens displays self-correction on our six self-reflection tasks. Figure 1: As pre-training compute increases, OLMo-2 checkpoints solve more word problems from our adversarial version of GSM8K-Platinum, leveraging explicit reflection. For the definition of pre-training compute please refer to section 4.3. Essential AI (2025)Reflection enhances models ability to adapt its response to prior reasoning, thereby improving the accuracy of its outputs. Recent work reports that "behaviors such as reflection... emerge as result of the models interaction with the reinforcement learning environment" [DeepSeek-AI, 2025a]. Attributing the development of capabilities to validate such claims necessitates comprehensive evaluation throughout the training phases. In this work, we propose an exhaustive framework to measure reflection and we observe the phenomenon consistently during pre-training. Benchmarking reflection using existing reasoning datasets [Mondorf and Plank, 2024] has been challenging. Reflection is often sparse in such tasks, and each model exhibits distinct error patterns that yield unique manifestations of reflective behavior [Madaan et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2025]. We address this challenge by distinguishing between situational-reflection and self-reflection. In the situational setting, model examines reasoning chains created by another source, such as different frontier model. In self-reflection, the model considers its own reasoning processes. We calibrate models ability to solve task when provided with some confounding reasoning that leads to an incorrect answer, and thereby measure reflection capabilities throughout the pre-training process. Figure 2 shows an attempt by partially pre-trained OLMo-2 checkpoint [OLMo et al., 2025] to solve coding task [Gu et al., 2024]. In this case, the model is given question about determining the input to the Python function that leads to the output avdropj gsd . In its first attempt, the model which has 32 billion parameters and was pre-trained on 4.8 trillion tokens repeats the output as the answer, advdropj gsd . Upon prompting it with its incorrect thinking plus suffix of Wait,, the model is able to successfully self-reflect and generates think got it wrong. . . . the value of ?? should be [gsd, avdropj]. Figure 2: partially pre-trained OLMo-2-32B model exhibits self-reflection to correctly predict programs input. Note that the question is sample_485 from CruxEval. For brevity, formatting instructions are omitted from the visualized prompt. By programmatically introducing erroneous chains-of-thought (CoTs), featuring elements such as arithmetic perturbations and logical inconsistencies, we can control and scale the extent of reflection needed to complete these tasks correctly. This also maintains the established CoT format [Wei et al., 2022]. Furthermore, our algorithmic approach permits the creation of these datasets in relatively rapid and economical manner by adapting established reasoning benchmarks, which in turn allows for comprehensive study of models reflection abilities across diverse range of domains. Our six datasets, spanning the domains of Mathematics, Coding, Logical Reasoning, and Knowledge Acquisition, are designed to assess both situational-reflection and self-reflection capabilities.1. 1Our data and code will be publicly released at https://github.com/Essential-AI/reflection 2 The results of evaluating pre-training checkpoints from the OLMo-2 family of models with varying compute on our set of six diverse datasets indicate that reflection is ubiquitous across domains. Even simple trigger phrase like Wait,[Muennighoff et al., 2025] enables partially pre-trained models to consistently identify both introduced errors and their own generated errors. Specifically, 231 of 240 dataset-checkpoint pairs demonstrate at least one instance of situational-reflection and 154 of 240 pairs demonstrate at least one instance of self-reflection. With increasing pre-training, models correct more adversarial examples, leading to an average Pearson correlation between accuracy and log(pre-training compute) of 0.76 across tasks. Furthermore, as pre-training progresses, models increasingly recover from incorrect prior reasoning, the rate of explicit reflection in model generations increases, and explicit reflection increasingly contributes to recovery from confounding CoTs. The contributions of this paper are threefold: We introduce systematic method to create six datasets across Code, Knowledge Acquisition, Logical Reasoning, and Mathematics to study models ability to reflect. We demonstrate that pre-trained models of varying capacities and training compute can elicit reflection to correct inaccurate prior reasoning using simple interjections in wide variety of domains. We observe that continually improving pre-training leads to better reflection, requiring fewer test-time tokens to solve the same number of tasks.Evaluating Reasoning in LLMs Real-world applicability of natural language systems is dependent on reasoning capabilities [Wos et al., 1992, Schuster et al., 2019, Mondorf and Plank, 2024]. LLMs, combined with prompting techniques such as Chain of Thought [Wei et al., 2022], Tree of Thought [Yao et al., 2023], and Self-Consistency [Wang et al., 2023b] have been successfully used to solve variety of reasoning tasks [Kojima et al., 2022, Bubeck et al., 2023]. Reasoning is typically measured by observing model outcomes [Fu et al., 2023a, Liu et al., 2023], through generation traces [Saparov and He, 2023, Dziri et al., 2023, Willig et al., 2022] and interactive engagement [Zhuang et al., 2024, Wang et al., 2023a, Bertolazzi et a"

A language model's ability to reflect on its own reasoning provides a key advantage for solving complex problems. While most recent research has focused on how this ability develops during reinforcement learning, we show that it actually begins to emerge much earlier - during the model's pre-training. To study this, we introduce deliberate errors into chains-of-thought and test whether the model can still arrive at the correct answer by recognizing and correcting these mistakes. By tracking performance across different stages of pre-training, we observe that this self-correcting ability appears early and improves steadily over time. For instance, an OLMo2-7B model pre-trained on 4 trillion tokens displays self-correction on our six self-reflection tasks.

Increasing test-time computation has emerged as a promising direction for improving language model performance, particularly in scenarios where model finetuning is impractical or impossible due to computational constraints or private model weights. However, existing test-time search methods using a reward model (RM) often degrade in quality as compute scales, due to the over-optimization of what are inherently imperfect reward proxies. We introduce QAlign, a new test-time alignment approach. As we scale test-time compute, QAlign converges to sampling from the optimal aligned distribution for each individual prompt. By adopting recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo for text generation, our method enables better-aligned outputs without modifying the underlying model or even requiring logit access. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QAlign on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and GSM-Symbolic) using a task-specific RM, showing consistent improvements over existing test-time compute methods like best-of-n and majority voting. Furthermore, when applied with more realistic RMs trained on the Tulu 3 preference dataset, QAlign outperforms direct preference optimization (DPO), best-of-n, majority voting, and weighted majority voting on a diverse range of datasets (GSM8K, MATH500, IFEval, MMLU-Redux, and TruthfulQA). A practical solution to aligning language models at test time using additional computation without degradation, our approach expands the limits of the capability that can be obtained from off-the-shelf language models without further training.
