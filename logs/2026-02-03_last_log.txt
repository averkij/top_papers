Text:"VOXSERVE: Streaming-Centric Serving System for Speech Language Models 6 2 0 2 0 3 ] . [ 1 9 6 2 0 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Keisuke Kamahori 1 Wei-Tzu Lee 1 Atindra Jha 2 Rohan Kadekodi 1 Stephanie Wang 1 Arvind Krishnamurthy 1 Baris Kasikci 1 Abstract Deploying modern Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) in streaming settings requires systems that provide low latency, high throughput, and strong guarantees of streamability. Existing systems fall short of supporting diverse models flexibly and efficiently. We present VOXSERVE, unified serving system for SpeechLMs that optimizes streaming performance. VOXSERVE introduces model-execution abstraction that decouples model architecture from system-level optimizations, thereby enabling support for diverse SpeechLM architectures within single framework. Building on this abstraction, VOXSERVE implements streaming-aware scheduling and an asynchronous inference pipeline to improve endto-end efficiency. Evaluations across multiple modern SpeechLMs show that VOXSERVE achieves 1020 higher throughput than existing implementations at comparable latency while maintaining high streaming viability. The code of VOXSERVE is available at https://github .com/vox-serve/vox-serve. 1. Introduction In recent years, speech models built upon large language model (LLM) foundations have made substantial progress in tasks such as Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Speech (STS) (Arora et al., 2025). These Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) leverage LLM backbones and neural audio codec models (Mousavi et al., 2025) to generate and understand speech representations. SpeechLMs are increasingly deployed at scale in real-world applications, including virtual assistants, content generation, and language access services (OpenAI, 2025; ElevenLabs, 2025; Yao, 2025). This widespread adoption demands serving systems that are both low-latency and cost-efficient. The 1University of Washington 2Stanford University.

Nevertheless, at the limits of model capability, CoT often proves insufficient, and its strictly sequential nature constrains test-time scalability. potential alternative is divide-and-conquer (DAC) reasoning, which decomposes complex problem into subproblems to facilitate more effective exploration of the solution. Although promising, our analysis reveals fundamental misalignment between general-purpose post-training and DAC-style inference, which limits the models capacity to fully leverage this potential. To bridge this gap and fully unlock LLMs reasoning capabilities on the most challenging tasks, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework to enhance their DAC-style reasoning capacity. At each step, the policy decomposes problem into group of subproblems, solves them sequentially, and addresses the original one conditioned on the subproblem solutions, with both decomposition and solution integrated into RL training. Under comparable training, our DAC-style framework endows the model with higher performance ceiling and stronger test-time scalability, surpassing CoT by 8.6% in Pass@1 and 6.3% in Pass@32 on competition-level benchmarks.

Text:"CUA-Skill: Develop Skills for Computer Using Agent MicrosoftComputer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate computer systems to complete real-world tasks. However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUASkill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

Introduction Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to complete real-world desktop tasks such as document editing, web navigation, data analysis, and system configuration (Xie et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025c; Yang et al., 2025b; Hui et al., 2025). Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and 1See full author list in Appendix A. Copyright 2026 by the Microsoft. Figure 1. Success rate vs. execution steps on WAA. multimodal perception have substantially improved agents abilities to interpret user intent and visually ground actions on the screen, making CUAs promising pathway toward general-purpose digital assistants capable of interacting with complex desktop environments. Despite this progress, building reliable and scalable CUAs remains challenging. Existing systems often struggle with long-horizon tasks that require executing dozens of interdependent actions across dynamic UI states. Small errors in grounding, planning, or execution can quickly compound, leading to brittle behavior and low end-to-end success rates. More fundamentally, most current approaches lack an explicit representation of how humans use computers: desktop interaction is typically modeled as flat sequences of low-level actions, forcing agents to repeatedly rediscover common workflows from scratch. In contrast to current CUAs, human computer use is inherently structured around reusable procedural knowledge. Users rely on familiar skills, such as launching applications, navigating menus, or formatting documents, which are composed into higher-level workflows and adapted to the current UI context. The lack of such reusable and structured skill abstractions remains key bottleneck for existing CUAs, limiting their scalability, generalization, and robustness on CUA-Skill: Develop Skills for Computer Using Agent Figure 2. Overview of CUA-Skill and Associated Skill-Agent. complex real-world tasks. Concurrently, Anthropic introduced the notion of agent skills as reusable, filesystem-based resources that encapsulate domain expertise (Notov, 2025). While effective in code-centric environments (e.g., Linux or API-rich systems), these skills are primarily executed through scripts and tightly integrated with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) (Anthropic, 2024a). As result, they are less suited for desktop environments such as Windows, where many applications expose limited or inconsistent programmatic APIs and effective task execution fundamentally makes them difficult to leverage across applications. Therefore, question is naturally raised: How can we build scalable and transferable skill base for desktop environments that captures human procedural knowledge and enables reliable and capable CUAs? In this work, we answer this question by introducing CUASkill, the first systematic agentic skill library designed for desktop computer use. CUA-Skill encodes human computer-use knowledge as reusable skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs, forming structured intermediate layer between high-level user intent and low-level interaction primitives. While GUI primitives serve as the primary, human-aligned substrate for skill execution, the execution graph abstraction flexibly supports scriptand code-based execution paths when they offer improved reliability or efficiency. This unified parameterization makes skills transferable across tasks, UI states, and applications, enabling strong generalization. Built on top of this skill base, we develop CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that performs retrievalaugmented skill selection, configuration, and execution. At each step, an LLM-based planner retrieves relevant skills conditioned on the current UI state and user goal, re-ranks candidates using execution context and memory, instantiates skill arguments, and executes the selected skill via GUI grounding or direct script execution, depending on the instantiated execution path. This design supports scalable skill expansion, memory-aware recovery from failures, and robust long-horizon task completion without hard-coding tools into prompts or relying on monolithic plans (Huang et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023). Our main contributions are summarized as follows: CUA-Skill. We introduce structured agentic skill library for desktop environments that encodes human computer-use knowledge as reusable, parameterized skills with explicit execution and composition graphs. This design enables strong transferability and generalization across tasks and UI states. The initial release contains hundreds of carefully engineered atomic skills spanning tens of popular applications. Through parameterization and composition, these skills can be instantiated into millions or more executable task variants, supporting wide range of downstream agent applications. CUA-Skill Agent. To effectively utilize CUA-Skill, we propose skill-centric, retrieval-augmented agent that performs "

VoxServe is a unified serving system for Speech Language Models that enhances streaming performance through model-execution abstraction, streaming-aware scheduling, and asynchronous inference pipelines.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deploying modern Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) in streaming settings requires systems that provide low latency, high throughput, and strong guarantees of streamability. Existing systems fall short of supporting diverse models flexibly and efficiently. We present VoxServe, a unified serving system for SpeechLMs that optimizes streaming performance. VoxServe introduces a model-execution abstraction that decouples model architecture from system-level optimizations, thereby enabling support for diverse SpeechLM architectures within a single framework. Building on this abstraction, VoxServe implements streaming-aware scheduling and an asynchronous inference pipeline to improve end-to-end efficiency. Evaluations across multiple modern SpeechLMs show that VoxServe achieves 10-20x higher throughput than existing implementations at comparable latency while maintaining high streaming viability. The code of VoxServe is available at https://github.com/vox-serve/vox-serve.

"VoxServe is a unified serving system for Speech Language Models that enhances streaming performance through model-execution abstraction, streaming-aware scheduling, and asynchronous inference pipelines.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deploying modern Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) in streaming settings requires systems that provide low latency, high throughput, and strong guarantees of streamability. Existing systems fall short of supporting diverse models flexibly and efficiently. We present VoxServe, a unified serving system for SpeechLMs that optimizes streaming performance. VoxServe introduces a model-execution abstraction that decouples model architecture from system-level optimizations, thereby enabling support for diverse SpeechLM architectures within a single framework. Building on this abstraction, VoxServe implements streaming-aware scheduling and an asynchronous inference pipeline to improve end-to-end efficiency. Evaluations across multiple modern SpeechLMs show that VoxServe achieves 10-20x higher throughput than existing implementations at comparable latency while maintaining high streaming viability. The code of VoxServe is available at https://github.com/vox-serve/vox-serve."

An end-to-end reinforcement learning framework enhances large language models' reasoning capabilities by implementing divide-and-conquer strategies that outperform traditional chain-of-thought reasoning on challenging benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities through step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Nevertheless, at the limits of model capability, CoT often proves insufficient, and its strictly sequential nature constrains test-time scalability. A potential alternative is divide-and-conquer (DAC) reasoning, which decomposes a complex problem into subproblems to facilitate more effective exploration of the solution. Although promising, our analysis reveals a fundamental misalignment between general-purpose post-training and DAC-style inference, which limits the model's capacity to fully leverage this potential. To bridge this gap and fully unlock LLMs' reasoning capabilities on the most challenging tasks, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework to enhance their DAC-style reasoning capacity. At each step, the policy decomposes a problem into a group of subproblems, solves them sequentially, and addresses the original one conditioned on the subproblem solutions, with both decomposition and solution integrated into RL training. Under comparable training, our DAC-style framework endows the model with a higher performance ceiling and stronger test-time scalability, surpassing CoT by 8.6% in Pass@1 and 6.3% in Pass@32 on competition-level benchmarks.

CUA-Skill introduces a large-scale library of engineered computer-use skills that enhance agent performance and efficiency on Windows-based tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate computer systems to complete real-world tasks. However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

"CUA-Skill introduces a large-scale library of engineered computer-use skills that enhance agent performance and efficiency on Windows-based tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate computer systems to complete real-world tasks. However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches. The project page is available at https://microsoft.github.io/cua_skill/."
