Text:"KIMI K2.5: VISUAL AGENTIC INTELLIGENCE TECHNICAL REPORT OF KIMI K2.5 Kimi TeamWe introduce Kimi K2.5, an open-source multimodal agentic model designed to advance general agentic intelligence. K2.5 emphasizes the joint optimization of text and vision so that two modalities enhance each other. This includes series of techniques such as joint text-vision pre-training, zero-vision SFT, and joint text-vision reinforcement learning. Building on this multimodal foundation, K2.5 introduces Agent Swarm, self-directed parallel agent orchestration framework that dynamically decomposes complex tasks into heterogeneous sub-problems and executes them concurrently. Extensive evaluations show that Kimi K2.5 achieves state-of-the-art results across various domains including coding, vision, reasoning, and agentic tasks. Agent Swarm also reduces latency by up to 4.5 over single-agent baselines. We release the post-trained Kimi K2.5 model checkpoint1 to facilitate future research and real-world applications of agentic intelligence. 6 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 6 7 2 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Figure 1: Kimi K2.5 main results.Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving toward agentic intelligence. Recent advances, such as GPT5.2 [41], Claude Opus 4.5 [6], Gemini 3 Pro [20], and Kimi K2-Thinking [1], demonstrate substantial progress in agentic capabilities, particularly in tool calling and reasoning. These models increasingly exhibit the ability to decompose complex problems into multi-step plans and to execute long sequences of interleaved reasoning and actions. 1https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5 Kimi K2.5 TECHNICAL REPORT In this report, we introduce the training methods and evaluation results of Kimi K2.5. Concretely, we improve the training of K2.5 over previous models in the following two key aspects. Joint Optimization of Text and Vision. key insight from the practice of K2.5 is that joint optimization of text and vision enhances both modalities and avoids the conflict. Specifically, we devise set of techniques for this purpose. During pre-training, in contrast to conventional approaches that add visual tokens to text backbone at late stage [8, 21], we find early vision fusion with lower ratios tends to yield better results given the fixed total vision-text tokens. Therefore, K2.5 mixes text and vision tokens with constant ratio throughout the entire training process. Architecturally, Kimi K2.5 employs MoonViT-3D, native-resolution vision encoder incorporating the NaViT packing strategy [15], enabling variable-resolution image inputs. For video understanding, we introduce lightweight 3D ViT compression mechanism: consecutive frames are grouped in fours, processed through the shared MoonViT encoder, and temporally averaged at the patch level. This design allows Kimi K2.5 to process videos up to 4 longer within the same context window while maintaining complete weight sharing between image and video encoders. During post-training, we introduce zero-vision SFTtext-only SFT alone activates visual reasoning and tool use. We find that adding human-designed visual trajectories at this stage hurts generalization. In contrast, text-only SFT performs betterlikely because joint pretraining already establishes strong vision-text alignment, enabling capabilities to generalize naturally across modalities. We then apply joint RL on both text and vision tasks. Crucially, we find visual RL enhances textual performance rather than degrading it, with improvements on MMLU-Pro and GPQADiamond. This bidirectional enhancementtext bootstraps vision, vision refines textrepresents superior crossmodal alignment in joint training. Agent Swarm: Parallel Agent Orchestration. Most existing agentic models rely on sequential execution of tool calls. Even systems capable of hundreds of reasoning steps, such as Kimi K2-Thinking [1], suffer from linear scaling of inference time, leading to unacceptable latency and limiting task complexity. As agentic workloads grow in scope and heterogeneitye.g., building complex project that involves massive-scale research, design, and developmentthe sequential paradigm becomes increasingly inefficient. To overcome the latency and scalability limits of sequential agent execution, Kimi K2.5 introduces Agent Swarm, dynamic framework for parallel agent orchestration. We propose Parallel-Agent Reinforcement Learning (PARL) paradigm that departs from traditional agentic RL [2]. In addition to optimizing tool execution via verifiable rewards, the model is equipped with interfaces for sub-agent creation and task delegation. During training, sub-agents are frozen and their execution trajectories are excluded from the optimization objective; only the orchestrator is updated via reinforcement learning. This decoupling circumvents two challenges of end-to-end co-optimization: credit assignment ambiguity and training instability. Agent Swarm enables complex tasks to be decomposed into heterogeneous subproblems executed concurrently by domain-specialized agents, transforming task complexity from linear scaling to parallel processing. In wide-search scenarios, Agent Swarm reduces inference latency by up to 4.5 while improving item-level F1 from 72.8% to 79.0% compared to single-agent baselines. Kimi K2.5 represents unified architecture for general-purpose agentic intelligence, integrating vision and language, thinking and instant modes, chats and agents. It achieves strong performance across broad range of agentic and frontier benchmarks, including state-of-the-art results in visual-to-code generation (image/video-to-code) and realworld software engineering in our internal evaluations, while scaling both the diversity of specialized agents and the degree of parallelism. To accelerate community progress toward General Agentic Intelligence, we open-source our post-trained checkpoints of Kimi K2.5, enabling researchers and developers to explore, refine, and deploy scalable agentic intelligence.Kimi K2.5 is native multimodal model built upon Kimi K2 through large-scale joint pre-training on approximately 15 trillion mixed visual and text tokens. Unlike vision-adapted models that compromise either linguistic or visual capabilities, our joint pre-training paradigm enhances both modalities simultaneously. This section describes the multimodal joint optimization methodology that extends Kimi K2 to Kimi K2.5. 2.1 Native Multimodal Pre-Training key design question for multimodal pre-training is: Given fixed vision-text to"

[ 1 0 6 0 2 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r Figure 1. Panel A: We identify two key limitations of existing multimodal deep-research paradigms for image search. First, prior multimodal deep-research MLLMs largely ignore the search engine hit-rate problem. In image retrieval, single full-image or even entity-level query often fails to retrieve the required evidence; moreover, querying different-scale crops of the same entity can yield highly variable results. Second, existing methods are constrained in both reasoning depth and retrieval breadth, typically producing only short trajectories. In contrast, our approach supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, leading to substantially stronger performance. Panel B: Pipeline Overview. We synthesize high-quality VQA instances and multi-turn trajectories, and then integrate multimodal deep-research capabilities into an MLLM via SFT and RL training. This enables long-horizon reasoning that performs multi-turn, multi-entity, and multi-scale visual and textual search. Bottom Image: Performance Comparison. Our model achieves the SoTA performance on six benchmarks with comparatively smaller parameter. The our Large and Small models correspond to the 30B-A3B and 8B parameter scales, respectively, while Qwen3-VL and WebWatcher refer to Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinkin"

We consider repository comprehension and generation to be inverse processes within unified cycle: generation expands intent into implementation, while comprehension compresses implementation back into intent. To address this, we propose RPG-Encoder, framework that generalizes the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) from static generative blueprint into unified, high-fidelity representation. RPG-Encoder closes the reasoning loop through three mechanisms: (1) Encoding raw code into the RPG that combines lifted semantic features with code dependencies; (2) Evolving the topology incrementally to decouple maintenance costs from repository scale, reducing overhead by 95.7%; and (3) Operating as unified interface for structure-aware navigation. In evaluations, RPG-Encoder establishes state-of-the-art repository understanding on SWE-bench Verified with 93.7% Acc@5 and exceeds the best baseline by over 10% on SWE-bench Live Lite. These results highlight our superior fine-grained localization accuracy in complex codebases. Furthermore, it achieves 98.5% reconstruction coverage on RepoCraft, confirming RPGs high-fidelity capacity to mirror the original codebase and closing the loop between intent and implementation.

However, many existing benchmarks for GraphRAG rely on short, curated passages as external knowledge, failing to adequately evaluate systems in realistic settings involving long contexts and large-scale heterogeneous documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce WildGraphBench, benchmark designed to assess GraphRAG performance in the wild. We leverage Wikipedias unique structure, where cohesive narratives are grounded in long and heterogeneous external reference documents, to construct benchmark reflecting real-word scenarios. Specifically, we sample articles across 12 top-level topics, using their external references as the retrieval corpus and citation-linked statements as ground truth, resulting in 1,100 questions spanning three levels of complexity: single-fact QA, multi-fact QA, and section-level summarization. Experiments across multiple baselines reveal that current GraphRAG pipelines help on multi-fact aggregation when evidence comes from moderate number of sources, but this aggregation paradigm may overemphasize high-level statements at the expense of fine-grained details, leading to weaker performance on summarization tasks.

However, long trajectories in deep research often exceed model context limits, compressing token budgets for both evidence collection and report writing, and preventing effective test-time scaling. We introduce FS-Researcher, file-system-based, dual-agent framework that scales deep research beyond the context window via persistent workspace. Specifically, Context Builder agent acts as librarian which browses the internet, writes structured notes, and archives raw sources into hierarchical knowledge base that can grow far beyond context length. Report Writer agent then composes the final report section by section, treating the knowledge base as the source of facts. In this framework, the file system serves as durable external memory and shared coordination medium across agents and sessions, enabling iterative refinement beyond the context window. Experiments on two open-ended benchmarks (DeepResearch Bench and DeepConsult) show that FS-Researcher achieves state-of-the-art report quality across different backbone models. Further analyses demonstrate positive correlation between final report quality and the computation allocated to the Context Builder, validating effective test-time scaling under the file-system paradigm. The code and data are anonymously open-sourced at https://github.com/Ignoramus0817/FS-Researcher.

However, it is challenging to optimize high-dimensional pixel manifolds that contain many perceptually irrelevant signals, leaving existing pixel diffusion methods lagging behind latent diffusion models. We propose PixelGen, simple pixel diffusion framework with perceptual supervision. Instead of modeling the full image manifold, PixelGen introduces two complementary perceptual losses to guide diffusion model towards learning more meaningful perceptual manifold. An LPIPS loss facilitates learning better local patterns, while DINO-based perceptual loss strengthens global semantics. With perceptual supervision, PixelGen surpasses strong latent diffusion baselines. It achieves an FID of 5.11 on ImageNet-256 without classifier-free guidance using only 80 training epochs, and demonstrates favorable scaling performance on large-scale text-to-image generation with GenEval score of 0.79. PixelGen requires no VAEs, no latent representations, and no auxiliary stages, providing simpler yet more powerful generative paradigm. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/ Zehong-Ma/PixelGen. Figure 1. This work shows that pixel diffusion with perceptual loss outperforms latent diffusion. (a) traditional two-stage latent diffusion denoises in the latent space, which is influenced by the artifacts of the VAE.

Introduction Diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021) have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity image generation, offering exceptional quality and diversity. Research in this field generally follows two main directions: latent diffusion and pixel diffusion. Latent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022; Peebles & Xie, 2023; Ma et al., 2024; Labs, 2024) split generation into two stages. As illustrated in Figure 1(a), VAE first compresses images into latent space, and diffusion model then performs denoising in that space. The performance of 1State Key Laboratory of Multimedia Information Processing, School of Computer Science, Peking University. latent diffusion methods is largely constrained by the VAEs, where the reconstruction quality limits the upper bound of the generation quality. Furthermore, the learned latent distribution can significantly affect the convergence speed of diffusion training (Yao & Wang, 2025; Leng et al., 2025). These works have demonstrated that VAEs introduce lowlevel artifacts and representational bottlenecks of the latent diffusion model. Pixel diffusion models avoid these limitations by modeling raw pixels directly. This end-to-end pipeline removes the need for latent representations and eliminates VAE-induced artifacts. However, it is difficult for the diffusion model to 1 PixelGen: Pixel Diffusion Beats Latent Diffusion with Perceptual Loss no VAEs, and no auxiliary stages. We evaluate PixelGen on both class-to-image and text-toimage generation. PixelGen achieves leading FID score of 5.11 on ImageNet 256 without classifier-free guidance (CFG) using only 80 epochs. It outperforms the strong latent diffusion model REPA (Yu et al., 2024), which achieves an FID of 5.90 with 800 training epochs. Our pretrained text-to-image model also achieves an overall score of 0.79 on GenEval. These results show that pixel diffusion with perceptual loss has strong potential to outperform traditional two-stage latent diffusion method. In summary, our contributions are as follows: i) We propose PixelGen, simple end-to-end pixel diffusion framework with two complementary perceptual losses, simplifying the generative pipeline while improving performance. It requires no latent representations, no VAEs, and no auxiliary stages. ii) We demonstrate that pixel diffusion with perceptual losses can outperform the two-stage latent diffusion on ImageNet without CFG, highlighting pixel diffusion as simpler yet more powerful generative paradigm. 2. Related Work This work is closely related to latent diffusion, pixel diffusion, and perceptual supervision. This section briefly reviews recent works. Latent Diffusion. Latent diffusion trains diffusion models in compact latent space learned by VAE (Rombach et al., 2022). Compared to raw pixel space, the latent space significantly reduces spatial dimensionality, easing learning difficulty and computational cost (Rombach et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2024). Consequently, VAEs have become fundamental component in modern diffusion models (Peebles & Xie, 2023; Karras et al., 2024; Yue et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Teng et al., 2024; Song et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2023b; Yao et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2023a). However, training VAEs often involves adversarial objectives, which complicate the overall pipeline (Wang et al., 2025a). Poorly trained VAEs can produce decoding artifacts (Zhou et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025b) and introduce bottleneck, limiting the generalization quality of latent diffusion models. Early latent diffusion models mainly used U-Net-based architectures. The pioneering DiT (Peebles & Xie, 2023) introduced transformers into diffusion models, replacing the U-Net (Bao et al., 2023; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021). SiT (Ma et al., 2024) further validated the DiT with linear flow diffusion. Subsequent works explore enhancing latent diffusion through representation alignment and joint optimization. REPA (Yu et al., 2024) and REG align intermediate features with pretrained DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023) model to learn better semantics. REG (Wu et al., 2025b) entangles latents with high-level class token from DINOv2 Figure 2. Illustration of different manifolds within the pixel space. The image manifold is large manifold containing both perceptually significant information and imperceptible signals. The perceptual manifold contains perceptually important signals, providing better target for pixel space diffusion. P-D"

Text:"SLIME: Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement for Preference Optimization Maksim Afanasyev * 1 Illarion Iov * 1 Abstract Direct preference optimization methods have emerged as computationally efficient alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs). Latest approaches have streamlined the alignment process by deriving implicit reward functions, yet they often suffer from critical objective mismatch: optimizing the relative margin between chosen and rejected responses does not guarantee the preservation of the chosen responses absolute likelihood. This can lead to unlearning, where the model degrades the probability of high-quality outputs to satisfy margin constraints, and formatting collapse caused by the over-penalization of rejected sequences. In this work, we introduce SLIME (Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement), reference-free alignment objective designed to decouple preference learning from generation quality. SLIME incorporates three-pronged objective: (1) an anchoring term to maximize the likelihood of preferred responses; (2) stabilizing penalty that prevents the probabilities of rejected tokens from collapsing to zero; and (3) dual-margin mechanism that combines hard and soft constraints for precise boundary shaping. Our results demonstrate that SLIME achieves superior performance compared to stateof-the-art baselines while maintaining higher generation stability. 6 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 3 8 3 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r 1.

Moreover, our theory-motivated automatic environment adaptation improves training for both the reward and policy models by leveraging critic feedback from each, enabling learning from experience. Empirically, each added component consistently improves the overall system, and RLAnything yields substantial gains across various representative LLM and agentic tasks, boosting Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking by 9.1% on OSWorld and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct by 18.7% and 11.9% on Alf World and LiveBench, respectively.

Specifically, the policy is trained with integrated feedback from step-wise and outcome signals, while the reward model is jointly optimized via consistency feedback, which in turn further improves policy training. Moreover, our theory-motivated automatic environment adaptation improves training for both the reward and policy models by leveraging critic feedback from each, enabling learning from experience. Empirically, each added component consistently improves the overall system, and RLAnything yields substantial gains across various representative LLM and agentic tasks, boosting Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking by 9.1% on OSWorld and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct by 18.7% and 11.9% on Alf World and LiveBench, respectively.

Corresponding author(s): yangling0818@163.com RLAnything: Forge Environment, Policy, and Reward Model in Completely Dynamic RL System Figure 2 Motivation and takeaways of our RLAnything framework. First, in complex real-world applications, reinforcement learning benefits from integrating step-wise rewards with outcome rewards. Second, the reward model can be jointly optimized with the policy via outcome supervision and self-consistency signals. Third, we show that adapting environment task difficulty to the policys capability not only facilitates policy learning but also improves reward model training within our framework. Environment tasks leverage critic feedback from both the policy and the reward model to drive automatic, targeted adaptation, further enabling active learning from experience. 1. Introduction Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an effective approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (Guo et al., 2025a; OpenAI, 2024; Shao et al., 2024). However, as real-world applications extend beyond single-turn question answering, especially when policies interact with environments iteratively over long trajectories, binary outcome rewards alone provide insufficient supervision (Lightman et al., 2023; Xi et al., 2025; Xiong et al., 2024). Step-wise signals are typically provided by generative reward models, which often outperform scalarbased models by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of language models (Liu et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024). However, training these models usually requires collecting high-quality, task-specific supervision (Xi et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025), motivating the need for more automated methods and scalable supervision. Beyond reward design, the quality of the environment is also vital for scaling reinforcement learning. Aligning task difficulty with models current capabilities is known to improve training dynamics (Yang et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025). In RLVR, it has been shown that adapting task difficulty during optimization can improve policy training (Zeng et al., 2025). In real-world environments, such as computers for GUI agents (Wang et al., 2025a; Xie et al., 2024) or the physical world for robots (Kober et al., 2013), the scope of exploration is largely defined by the task. Moreover, scaling the environment by increasing task diversity can further promote policy generalization in broader scenarios (Cai et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025; Cobbe et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2025; Song et al., 2026; Team et al., 2021). If there exists an RL system that jointly optimizes the environment, policy, and reward model to amplify learning signals and strengthen the overall system? In this work, we propose RLAnything, dynamic RL framework that forges the environment, policy, and reward model in closed-loop system, where each component continuously receives feedback from the others to amplify learning signals across various complex LLM or agentic scenarios. First, the policy is trained with integrated feedback that combines verifiable outcome rewards with step-wise signals provided by the reward model. Second, the reward model is jointly optimized via consistency feedback based on outcome and self-consistency, producing reliable step-wise supervision that in turn improves policy learning. Finally, motivated by our theoretical results, we show that balancing task difficulty benefits not only policy training but also reward model training in our RL 2 RLAnything: Forge Environment, Policy, and Reward Model in Completely Dynamic RL System system. Accordingly, we adapt environment tasks using critic feedback from both the policy and reward model, enabling precise and automatic task adjustment. In particular, we feed the reward models summarized information, which captures the policys failures, into language model to perturb the task, providing concrete guidance on how to modify it. To demonstrate the generality of our framework, we conduct empirical studies in three representative scenarios on computer use setting (Xie et al., 2024), text-based interactive games (Côté et al., 2018; Shridhar et al., 2020), and coding LLMs. We summarize our main contributions as follows: We propose RLAnything, fully dynamic RL system that forges the environment, policy, and reward model through closed-loop optimization to amplify learning signals and strengthen the overall system, guided by our theoretical in"

Reward-based post-training has emerged as promising direction to improve the quality and semantic alignment of generated videos. However, recent methods either rely on largescale human preference annotations or operate on misaligned embeddings from pre-trained visionlanguage models, leading to limited scalability or suboptimal supervision.

Preprint. February 3, 2026. 1 dresses these limitations via novel Dual Optimal Transport (OT)-aligned Rewards module. To align reward signals with human judgment, PISCES uses OT to bridge text and video embeddings at both distributional and discrete token levels, enabling reward supervision to fulfill two objectives: (i) Distributional OT-aligned Quality Reward that captures overall visual quality and temporal coherence; and (ii) Discrete Token-level OTaligned Semantic Reward that enforces semantic, spatio-temporal correspondence between text and video tokens. To our knowledge, PISCES is the first to improve annotation-free reward supervision in generative post-training through the lens of OT. Experiments on both shortand long-video generation show that PISCES outperforms both annotation-based and annotation-free methods on VBench across Quality and Semantic scores, with PISCES : Annotation-free Text-to-Video Post-Training via Optimal Transport-Aligned Rewards human preference studies further validating its effectiveness. We show that the Dual OT-aligned Rewards module is compatible with multiple optimization paradigms, including direct backpropagation and reinforcement learning fine-tuning. 1. Introduction Text-to-video (T2V) generation (Kong et al., 2025; RunwayML, 2024) aims to synthesize videos from textual descriptions such that they appear realistic, temporally consistent, and accurately reflect the prompt. T2V has broad applications in multimedia content creation, robotics, and accessibility. While T2V performance is inherently subjective and judged by human preferences, recent benchmark (Huang et al., 2024) formalizes evaluation along two main dimensions Quality score, for the visual quality and temporal consistency; and Semantic score, factoring the correspondence of generated videos to text prompts. Rapid advances in diffusion and flow matching models (Podell et al., 2024; Esser et al., 2024) and VisionLanguage Models (VLMs) (Chung et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2024; GLM et al., 2024) have enabled the development of recent T2V models (Pika Labs, 2023; RunwayML, 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Kong et al., 2025). To further improve existing T2V models (Chen et al., 2024; Kong et al., 2025), particularly in terms of video-text misalignment in the denoisers, reward-based post-training (Li et al., 2025a; Liu et al., 2025b) has been introduced that provides additional supervision via specially designed rewards to the denoiser. Reward-based T2V post-training methods can be either Annotation-based or Annotation-free. Annotation-based approaches (Liu et al., 2025b; Yang et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b) collect large-scale human preference datasets, where annotators judge generated video pairs on quality and semantics, which are used to train reward model or via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023; Wallace et al., 2024) for post-training. Although effective and serving as existing SoTA, these annotationbased methods cannot easily scale because they need highquality preference-based annotations. Another line of work explores Annotation-free rewards, where supervision is derived from pre-trained VLMs rather than human labels (Li et al., 2024; 2025a). While these approaches do not need large-scale human annotations, their performance is not on par with the Annotation-based techniques. We aim to achieve the best of both worlds by asking: Can an annotation-free T2V post-training method match, or even outperform, annotation-based approaches? From review of annotation-free approaches, we identify reliance on pre-trained visionlanguage models (VLMs) for reward supervision as key limitation. VLMs are trained with non-distributional objectives, such as pointwise matching (Chen et al., 2020) and contrastive learning (Radford et al., 2021), that may not adequately align text with the real-video distribution, consistent with the patterns in Table 4 and Figure 6. This results in both quality and semantic issues, as shown in Figure 1c, such as failure to ensure the correct number and attributes of objects (e.g., zebra and bear, wearing brown beret and glasses) or failing to capture motion descriptors (e.g., closed-mouth smile). We posit that, for annotation-free reward supervision to mimic human preferences, the real-video distribution must be better aligned with the text distribution, which represents the space of human instructions/preferences, without altering the video distributions semantic structure, and the derived rewards should reflect human judgments of textto-video outputs on the dual of quality and semantics. We introduce PISCES1, an annotation-free T2V post-training algorithm that includes novel Dual Optimal Transportaligned Rewards module (Figure 1b). Leveraging Optimal Transport (OT) (Villani, 2009; Cuturi, 2013), we tailor PISCES specifically for T2V post-training by enhancing text-video alignment at both the distribution and the token level to simultaneo"

Moreover, constrained by static internal priors, these models remain unable to adapt to the evolving dynamics of the real world. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Mind-Brush, unified agentic framework that transforms generation into dynamic, knowledgedriven workflow. Simulating human-like thinkresearch-create paradigm, Mind-Brush actively retrieves multimodal evidence to ground out-ofdistribution concepts and employs reasoning tools to resolve implicit visual constraints. To rigorously evaluate these capabilities, we propose Mind-Bench, comprehensive benchmark comprising 500 distinct samples spanning real-time news, emerging concepts, and domains such as mathematical and Geo-Reasoning. Extensive exMind-Brush: Integrating Agentic Cognitive Search and Reasoning into Image Generation periments demonstrate that Mind-Brush significantly enhances the capabilities of unified models, realizing zero-to-one capability leap for the Qwen-Image baseline on Mind-Bench, while achieving superior results on established benchmarks like WISE and RISE. 1. Introduction Recent advancements in image generation have democratized visual creation, enabling the seamless translation of imagination into high-fidelity imagery (Rombach et al., 2022; Esser et al., 2024; Gong et al., 2025). However, fundamentally, the vast majority of existing models function primarily as static text-to-pixel decoders (Podell et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2025). Confined to mapping explicit user instructions to pixels, these models often fail to grasp implicit, high-level user intentions, thereby diverging significantly from the human artistic creation process. While emerging unified multimodal understanding-generation models, such as GPT-Image (OpenAI, 2024) and Bagel (Deng et al., 2025), demonstrate promising capabilities in comprehending user intent and incorporating world knowledge, their performance remains constrained in tasks demanding complex mathematical or knowledge-intensive reasoning. This limitation suggests that monolithic architectures may struggle to encompass the full spectrum of capabilities required for such intricate, end-to-end tasks. Moreover, constrained by the temporal knowledge cutoff inherent in pre-training data, the cognitive boundaries of current image generation models remain static. Consequently, they struggle to adapt to the evolving dynamics of the real world, resulting in significant capability gaps when handling real-time news or novel IP concepts (Son et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025a). In the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have successfully transcended these boundaries by integrating retrieval capabilities through agentic designs (Chen et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024), as exemplified by Search-o1 (Li et al., 2025c). While recent proprietary models such as Nano Banana Pro (Comanici et al., 2025) and FLUX-2 Max (Black Forest Labs, 2026b) have demonstrated integrated search and reasoning capabilities, significant gap persists within the open-source community. Specifically, there is notable absence of open-source models capable of interacting with the open world, performing complex reasoning, and executing active planning. Recently, agentic approaches for image generation have emerged (Jiang et al., 2026), such as T2I-Copilot (Chen et al., 2025a) and PromptSculptor (Xiang et al., 2025), which focus on elaborating concise instructions into detailrich descriptions. Think-Then-Gen (Kou et al., 2026) advances this further by leveraging LLMs to decompose user queries into sequential drawing steps. Nevertheless, these efforts remain largely confined to standard T2I benchmarks like GenEval++ (Ye et al., 2025a), prioritizing prompt refinement over intricate cognitive tasks such as mathematical derivation or commonsense reasoning. Crucially, due to the absence of external tools, their reasoning relies solely on internalized knowledge. Consequently, these methods falter when tasks demand factual verification of real-time events or evolving contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mind-Brush, unified agentic framework that shifts image generation from static mapping paradigm to dynamic, knowledge-driven workflow. Rather than treating generation as single-step inference, Mind-Brush orchestrates cognitive process: it actively retrieves multimodal evidence to ground out-ofdistribution concepts and employs logical reasoning to deduce implicit visual constraints, thereby realizing the unification of agentic understanding and generation. By effectively simulating the human artists Think-Research-Create workflow, Mind-Brush enables high-fidelity generation requiring real-time knowledge and handles tasks involving complex reasoning. Furthermore, existing image generation benchmarks, such as GenEval (Ghosh et al., 2023) and ImgEdit (Ye et al., 20"

[ 1 4 1 2 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aTo achieve real-time interactive video generation, current methods distill pretrained bidirectional video diffusion models into few-step autoregressive (AR) models, facing an architectural gap when full attention is replaced by causal attention. However, existing approaches do not bridge this gap theoretically. They initialize the AR student via ODE distillation, which requires framelevel injectivity, where each noisy frame must map to unique clean frame under the PF-ODE of an AR teacher. Distilling an AR student from bidirectional teacher violates this condition, preventing recovery of the teachers flow map and instead inducing conditional-expectation solution, which degrades performance. To address this issue, we propose Causal Forcing that uses an AR teacher for ODE initialization, thereby bridging the architectural gap. Empirical results show that our method outperforms all baselines across all metrics, surpassing the SOTA Self Forcing by 19.3% in Dynamic Degree, 8.7% in VisionReward, and 16.7% in Instruction Following.

Introduction Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in autoregressive (AR) video diffusion models (Jin et al., 2024; Teng et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025).

February 3, 2026. 1 within each frame, AR video diffusion enables wide range of real-time and interactive applications, including world modeling (Mao et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2025a; Hong et al., 2025), game simulation (Ball et al., 2025; Tang et al., 2025), embodied intelligence (Feng et al., 2025), and interactive content creation (Shin et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025b; Ki et al., 2026; Xiao et al., 2025). Despite their promise, the computational burden of multi-step diffusion sampling severely limits their real-time capabilities. To alleviate this latency bottleneck, recent works (Huang et al., 2025a; Yin et al., 2025) distill powerful pretrained bidirectional video diffusion model into few-step autoregressive student model. This is typically achieved via twostage pipeline: an initial ODE distillation to initialize the AR student, followed by DMD (Yin et al., 2024) to further boost performance. However, compared to standard stepdistillation, such AR distillation faces more fundamental challenge beyond the shared sampling-step gap, namely, the architectural gap. This gap arises from converting bidirectional model, which has access to future frames, into causal architecture that conditions solely on past context. Empirically, we find that even when distilled from the same bidirectional teacher, SOTA AR distillation methods (Huang et al., 2025a) still lag significantly behind standard DMD, which distills bidirectional student (see Fig. 1). In this paper, we show that the performance degradation stems from the failure of existing methods to properly address the architectural gap theoretically (see Fig. 3 and Sec. 3.2 ). Through controlled experiment, we first show that this gap cannot be resolved by the DMD stage and should instead be addressed during the preceding ODE initialization. Crucially, key requirement for ODE distillation is injectivity (Liu et al., 2022). In standard ODE distillation that distills bidirectional teacher into bidirectional student, injectivity naturally holds at the video level. In contrast, for an AR student, injectivity must hold at the frame level: each noisy frame must map to unique clean frame under the PF-ODE of the AR teacher. We refer to this requirement as frame-level injectivity. However, existing methods (Huang et al., 2025a; Yin et al., 2025) distill an AR student directly from bidirectional teacher, allowing the same noisy frame to correspond to multiple different clean Causal Forcing: Autoregressive Diffusion Distillation Done Right for High-Quality Real-Time Interactive Video Generation Figure 1. Limitations of existing methods. While distilling from the same bidirectional base model, SOTA autoregressive diffusion distillation methods like Self-Forcing still lag significantly behind standard DMD, which distills bidirectional student. frames. This violation of frame-level injectivity results in blurred and inconsistent video generation. Building on the above analysis, we propose Causal Forcing, which bridges the architectural gap by performing ODE distillation initialization with an AR teacher (see Sec. 3.3). We first train an AR diffusion model using teacher forcing, where we show that diffusion forcing is inferior to teacher forcing for AR diffusion training both theoretically and empirically. With this AR diffusion model as the teacher, we then perform causal ODE distillation by sampling its PFODE trajectories and training the AR student accordingly. Crucially, since the teacher is autoregressive rather than bidirectional, its PF-ODE naturally satisfies frame-level injectivity, enabling the student to accurately learn the flow map. Finally, following Self Forcing, we apply subsequent DMD stage to obtain few-step AR student, enabling efficient real-time video generation. To validate our approach, we conduct comprehensive evaluations against various baseline models (Wan et al., 2025; HaCohen et al., 2024; Deng et al., 2024; Jin et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025; Teng et al., 2025; Yin et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025a). Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms all baselines across all metrics, with significant gains in dynamic degree, visual quality, and instructionfollowing capability. Remarkably, under the same training budget as existing distilled autoregressive video models, it surpasses the SOTA Self-Forcing (Huang et al., 2025a) baseline b"

However, their core attention layers become major bottleneck at inference time: as generation progresses, the KV cache grows, causing both increasing latency and escalating GPU memory, which in turn restricts usable temporal context and harms long-range consistency. In this work, we study redundancy in autoregressive video diffusion and identify three persistent sources: near-duplicate cached keys across frames, slowly evolving (largely semantic) queries/keys that make many attention computations redundant, and cross-attention over long prompts where only small subset of tokens matters per frame. Building on these observations, we propose unified, training-free attention framework for autoregressive diffusion: TempCache compresses the KV cache via temporal correspondence to bound cache growth; AnnCA accelerates cross-attention by selecting frame-relevant prompt tokens using fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) matching; and AnnSA sparsifies self-attention by restricting each query to semantically matched keys, also using lightweight ANN. Together, these modules reduce attention, compute, and memory and are compatible with existing autoregressive diffusion backbones and world models. Experiments demonstrate up to 510 end-to-end speedups while preserving near-identical visual quality and, crucially, maintaining stable throughput and nearly constant peak GPU memory usage over long rollouts, where prior methods progressively slow down and suffer from increasing memory usage.

Correspondence to: Dvir Samuel <dvirsamuel@gmail.com>. Preprint. 1 Video diffusion models (HaCohen et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025; Kong et al., 2024) have achieved strong results in offline video synthesis, where all frames in short clip are generated jointly, producing high visual fidelity and temporally coherent motion. Recently, autoregressive video diffusion models (Yin et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025) have emerged to enable streaming generation: frames are produced sequentially in an online manner and can be consumed immediately. This transition from offline to online generation unlocks new applications, including long-form video generation (Liu et al., 2025b), controlled video world models (Agarwal et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2025), and neural game engines (Gao et al., 2025; HunyuanWorld, 2025). Despite these new capabilities, autoregressive video diffusion models expose critical bottleneck in their attention mechanisms, leading to two fundamental challenges: (a) Generation speed. 3D spatio-temporal attention scales with the number of cached keys. As the KV cache grows with each generated frame, the per-step attention cost (and thus latency) increases over time, making long or unbounded generation progressively slower. (b) Memory efficiency. The expanding KV cache also creates substantial memory overhead, limiting how much temporal context can fit on GPU. This often forces short context windows (Liu et al., 2025b), which in turn harms long-range temporal consistency. Despite KV-cache efficiency being central to autoregressive video generation, it remains relatively underexplored: KVcache compression techniques from NLP (for LLMs) can not be applied directly (Anonymous, 2026), and recent methods (Liu et al., 2025a; Anonymous, 2026) offer only modest speedups, sometimes with quality degradation. In parallel, most progress on accelerating 3D spatio-temporal attention targets offline video diffusion (Xi et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025; Li* et al., 2025). Yet these gains do not reliably transfer to online autoregressive models, where the same methods frequently degrade quality and deliver limited, or even negative, speedups due to unfavorable memory and cache behavior. Following this, we therefore analyze whether autoregressive video diffusion contains exploitable redundancy, and find three consistent sources that are not directly addressed by existing sparse attention designs: (i) many Figure 1. Our method substantially accelerates pre-trained autoregressive video diffusion models and autoregressive world models while maintaining high visual quality, by introducing new KV-cache compression with selfand cross-attention sparsification. On single H100 GPU, it achieves 510 speedups for multi-minute video generation, without further training/optimization, and keeps peak GPU memory nearly constant over long rollouts. cached keys are near-duplicates across frames, enabling aggressive KV merging; (ii) and evolve slowly and are largely semantic, making many querykey dot products (attention score computations) redundant; and (iii) crossattention wastes compute on long prompts although only few tokens matter per frame. Motivated by these observations, we introduce unified attention framework: TempCache compresses the KV cache using temporal correspondence; AnnCA prunes prompt tokens per frame, in cross-attention layers, using fast Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) matching; and AnnSA sparsifies self-attention by restricting each query to semantically matched keys, also using lightweight ANN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of ANN-based attention in autoregressive diffusion models in fully training-free manner, requiring no retraining or fine-tuning. Experiments on autoregressive video diffusion and video world models show that our approach yields up to 510 end-to-end speedup (Figure 1), while maintaining nearly constant GPU memory over long rollouts, whereas baselines accumulate cache with increasing memory, and degrade video quality. 2. Related Work Autoregressive video diffusion models and video world models. Modern video diffusion (Wang et al., 2025; HunyuanWorld, 2025; HaCohen et al., 2024) models often adopt diffusion transformers (DiTs), which scale well but make video generation expensive due to long spatiotemporal token sequences and repeated denoising steps.

[ 1 5 9 3 1 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract Growing efforts to improve knowledge distillation (KD) in large language models (LLMs) replace dense teacher supervision with selective distillation, which uses subset of token positions, vocabulary classes, or training samples for supervision. However, it remains unclear which importance signals, selection policies, and their interplay are most effective. In this work, we revisit where and how to distill in autoregressive LLMs. We disentangle selective KD along the position, class, and sample axes and systematically compare importance signals and selection policies. Then, guided by this analysis, we identify underexplored opportunities and introduce student-entropy-guided position selection (SEKD). Across suite of benchmarks, SE-KD often improves accuracy, downstream task adherence, and memory efficiency over dense distillation. Extending this approach across the class and sample axes (SE-KD3X) yields complementary efficiency gains that make offline teacher caching feasible. In practice, this reduces wall time by 70% and peak memory by 18%, while cutting storage usage by 80% over prior methods without sacrificing performance. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art results across diverse tasks, but their size makes them expensive to serve and difficult to adapt. Knowledge distillation (KD; Hinton et al., 2015) addresses this by training smaller student model to imitate larger teacher. For autoregressive LLMs, this is typically done by matching the teachers nexttoken distribution at every position of the training sequence. However, applying knowledge distillation at every token position is often suboptimal due to the uniform supervision across all positions.

Current approaches primarily scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the text space, even when language alone is insufficient for clear and structured reasoning, and largely neglect visual reasoning mechanisms analogous to the human visuospatial sketchpad and visual imagery. To mitigate this deficiency, we introduce Cognitive Supersensing, novel training paradigm that endows MLLMs with human-like visual imagery capabilities by integrating Latent Visual Imagery Prediction (LVIP) head that jointly learns sequences of visual cognitive latent embeddings and aligns them with the answer, thereby forming vision-based internal reasoning chains. We further introduce reinforcement learning stage that optimizes text reasoning paths based on this grounded visual latent. To evaluate the cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, we present CogSense-Bench, comprehensive visual question answering (VQA) benchmark assessing five cognitive dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLLMs trained with Cognitive Supersensing significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines on CogSense-Bench and exhibit superior generalization on out-of-domain mathematics and science VQA benchmarks, suggesting that internal visual imagery is potentially key to bridging the gap between perceptual recognition and cognitive understanding.

Text:"Good SFT Optimizes for SFT, Better SFT Prepares for Reinforcement Learning Dylan Zhang 1 Yufeng (Felix) Xu 1 2 Haojin Wang 1 Qingzhi Chen 1 Hao Peng1. Introduction 6 2 0 2 1 ] . [ 1 8 5 0 1 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Post-training of reasoning LLMs is holistic process that typically consists of an offline SFT stage followed by an online reinforcement learning (RL) stage. However, SFT is often optimized in isolation to maximize SFT performance alone. We show that, after identical RL training, models initialized from stronger SFT checkpoints can significantly underperform those initialized from weaker ones. We attribute this to mismatch typical in current SFTRL pipelines: the distribution that generates the offline SFT data can differ substantially from the policy optimized during online RL, which learns from its own rollouts. We propose PEAR (Policy Evaluationinspired Algorithm for Offline Learning Loss Reweighting), an SFT-stage method that corrects this mismatch and better prepares the model for RL. PEAR uses importance sampling to reweight the SFT loss, with three variants operating at the token, block, and sequence levels. It can be used to augment standard SFT objectives and incurs little additional training overhead once probabilities for the offline data are collected. We conduct controlled experiments on verifiable reasoning games and mathematical reasoning tasks on Qwen2.5/3 and DeepSeek-distilled models. PEAR consistently improves post-RL performance over canonical SFT, with pass@8 gains up to 14.6% on AIME-2025. Our results suggest that PEAR is an effective step toward more holistic LLM post-training by designing and evaluating SFT with downstream RL in mind rather than in isolation. 1University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign 2New York University (Shanghai). Work done during internship at UIUC. Correspondence to: Dylan Zhang <shizhuo2@illinois.edu>, Hao Peng <haopeng@illinois.edu>. Preprint. February 3, 2026. 1 Post-training of reasoning language models typically follows two-stage paradigm: an offline supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase produces an initial checkpoint, which is then used to initialize an online reinforcement learning (RL) phase that further enhances the model (Shao et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024). Both areas have become active research fronts. In particular, growing body of work has proposed offline learning objectives to improve SFT, often by reweighting or regularizing next-token likelihood (Qin & Springenberg, 2025; Zhu et al., 2025d; Wu et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025a). From practical perspective, the performance of interest is usually the models final accuracy after completing both SFT and downstream RL. However, it is common that these existing techniques optimize for SFT-stage performance in isolation, often with the implicit assumption that gains in offline performance will translate to improved performance after RL. Kang et al. (2025) show that repetition and data homogeneity boost SFT but may reduce RL headroom. This motivates us to investigate if offline gains of an objective could also be misleading proxy for its effectiveness as an RL initialization. We empirically show the gains of stronger offline checkpoint over weaker one can shrink, disappear, or even reverse after both undergo identical RL training. Therefore, optimizing for offline performance alone may be counterproductive when the goal is strong final performance after RL (Fig. 1 in 2). We contend that the goal of an offline stage is not merely strong offline accuracy, but an initialization that facilitates improvement under the online RL. This requires addressing distribution mismatch between offline and online stages: Typically, during SFT, the model learns from data sampled from different distribution, often dubbed the behavior policy (Sutton & Barto, 2018; Precup et al., 2000; Uehara et al., 2022). In contrast, during online RL, the target of learning (thereby the target policy), learns from roll-outs generated by itself. There is clear distribution mismatch that needs to be corrected between them (Zhao et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2021; Zu et al., 2025) in order for an effective offline-to-online transition. It is therefore crucial to quantify and correct this distribution mismatch. Inspired by off-policy evaluation (OPE) (Precup Good SFT Optimizes for SFT, Better SFT Prepares for Reinforcement Learning Figure 1. Offline v.s. Online pass@1 on SynLogic Games on total of 19 Models. It exhibits significant ranking changes indicating offline performance will not entail online performance. In addtion, our proposed approach remains the most effective initialization for online RL. et al., 2000; Thomas & Brunskill, 2016; Jiang & Li, 2016; Levine et al., 2020), we address this by reweighting offline data using importance weights, i.e., the likelihood ratio between the target policy and the behavior policy (3). Intuitively, this reweighting scales each tokens loss according to how likely the target policy would generate the same continuation relative to the behavior policy, so that offline training better reflects the trajectories that online RL will actually revisit. We present sequence-level (Rowland et al., 2020) and token-wise reweighting based on suffix-ratios (Precup et al., 2000). We also present variants that improve stability by block-wise weighing and leveraging negative data. We evaluate PEAR and its variants on reasoning games and math benchmarks across 6 different models of various sizes: Qwen3-Base-0.6B; 1.7B; 4B and 8B (Yang et al., 2025), Qwen2.5-1.5B-Math (Yang et al., 2024) and DeepSeekDistill-Qwen-1.5B (Guo et al., 2025). Using an SFTRL pipeline that varies only the SFT-stage objectives, PEAR and its variants consistently improve post-RL performance over strong baselines. Comparing checkpoints finetuned from Qwen3-1.7B-Base using PEAR versus canonical SFT on the same data, the former outperform the latter by by 40% absolute accuracy on logic games, and achieve 14% Pass@8 gain on AIME-25 (Balunovic et al., 2026) (See 4.3). Moreover, our analysis shows that PEAR-initialized models undergo less parameter drift during RL 4.6. 2. Offline Performance May Not Entail Online There are various techniques to improve supervised finetuning (SFT) for reasoning, typically targeting stronger offline performance or reduced forgetting. Recent reasoning LM post-training pipeline typically applies an online RL stage to further improve performance after SFT (Shao et al"

In contrast, human communication is inherently multimodal, where visual instructions such as sketches efficiently convey spatial and structural intent. To address this gap, we introduce VIBE, the Visual Instruction Benchmark for Image Editing with three-level interaction hierarchy that captures deictic grounding, morphological manipulation, and causal reasoning. Across these levels, we curate high-quality and diverse test cases that reflect progressively increasing complexity in visual instruction following. We further propose robust LMM-asa-judge evaluation framework with task-specific metrics to enable scalable and fine-grained assessment. Through comprehensive evaluation of 17 representative open-source and proprietary image editing models, we find that proprietary models exhibit early-stage visual instruction-following capabilities and consistently outperform opensource models. However, performance degrades markedly with increasing task difficulty even for the strongest systems, highlighting promising directions for future research. 1.

[ 1 6 8 4 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aLLM-based deep research agents are largely built on the ReAct framework. This linear design makes it difficult to revisit earlier states, branch into alternative search directions, or maintain global awareness under long contexts, often leading to local optima, redundant exploration, and inefficient search. We propose Re-TRAC, an agentic framework that performs cross-trajectory exploration by generating structured state representation after each trajectory to summarize evidence, uncertainties, failures, and future plans, and conditioning subsequent trajectories on this state representation. This enables iterative reflection and globally informed planning, reframing research as progressive process. Empirical results show that Re-TRAC consistently outperforms ReAct by 1520% on BrowseComp with frontier LLMs. For smaller models, we introduce ReTRAC-aware supervised fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales. Notably, Re-TRAC shows monotonic reduction in tool calls and token usage across rounds, indicating progressively targeted exploration driven by cross-trajectory reflection rather than redundant search. Code and models are available at GitHub link. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have progressed from single-turn question answering to chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022), function calling (Schick et al., 2023), and complex multi-turn agentic applications (Anthropic, the internship *Equal Core Contributors This work was done dur1Southeast University ing 2Waseda University 3Tsinghua University 4Brown University 5Zhejiang University 6Microsoft. Correspondence Kai Qiu <Kai.Qiu@microsoft.com>, Zhirong Wu to: <Wu.Zhirong@microsoft.com>. at MSRA Preprint. February 3, 2026. 1 2025). This evolution reflects shift from passive response generation toward autonomous, goal-directed problem solving in open environments. deep research agent (OpenAI, 2025a; Google, 2025), capable of autonomously searching the open web and gathering and analyzing information from thousands of web pages, represents the next frontier of information retrieval for general intelligence. Most existing deep research agents are built upon the ReAct paradigm (Yao et al., 2022), which interleaves large language model (LLM) reasoning steps with tool invocation, appending both into the model context in linear sequential manner. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of the inherent limitations of ReAct-style linear reasoning workflows. Although LLM reasoning can be trained to support behaviors such as backtracking and self-reflection (Guo et al., 2025), this strictly linear agentic workflow is not well suited for open-ended tasks that require broad exploratory investigation. Revisiting earlier reasoning states and branching into alternative search trajectories remains challenging, particularly under long-context settings (e.g., 128K256K tokens), where context management and credit assignment become increasingly difficult. Consequently, the ReAct framework is susceptible to issues such as local optima, redundant exploration, and inefficient search dynamics (Yao et al., 2023). To empower LLM-based agents with diverse exploration capabilities, we propose to explicitly guide agents toward search trajectories that have not been previously explored. This direction is motivated by two key observations. First, existing deep research models (even after extensive reinforcement learning post-training) exhibit substantially higher pass@k performance than pass@1. This gap indicates that repeated inference induces diverse reasoning trajectories, suggesting that model limitations often stem from insufficient exploration within single trajectory rather than inadequate reasoning capacity. Second, prior work shows that LLMs are generally better at verifying candidate solutions than generating them from scratch (Weng et al., 2023; Singhi et al., 2025), motivating search paradigm that emphasizes broad candidate generation followed by verification-driven selection. RE-TRAC: REcursive TRAjectory Compression for Deep Search Agents Figure 1. Comparison of RE-TRAC with state-of-the-art agentic models. Our 4B and 30B models surpass the performance of significantly larger, state-of-the-art models. We propose Re-TRAC, an agentic framework that recursively constructs structured state representation at the end of each trajectory and uses them as the prompting context for subsequent trajectories. Each state representation summarizes the evolving state of investigation along multiple dimensions, including accumulated evidence, unresolved uncertainties, identified failure modes, and forward-looking research plan. Unlike multiple independent trajectories that operate in isolation, Re-TRAC enables iterative reflection, cross-trajectory knowledge consolidation, and globally informed planning. This design transforms exploration from set of disconnected attempts into progressively informed search process. Empirically, we observe that Re-TRAC agents issue fewer tool calls and consume fewer tokens with each successive round of research, indicating improved decision-making efficiency and more targeted information acquisition guided by prior experience. Our experiments demonstrate that Re-TRAC achieves absolute gains of 1520% over ReAct on the BrowseComp benchmark when applied with frontier LLMs. This inspires us to push the limits of abilities of small models via ReTRAC. To unlock the benefits of Re-TRAC for smaller models, we develop post-training recipe that constructs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data consisting of trajectories explicitly conditioned on structured state representations. This training procedure teaches the model to ground its reasoning, planning, and tool use on structured cross-trajectory summaries rather than relying solely on immediate context. After fine-tuning, our 30B model achieves 53% accuracy on BrowseComp, while the 4B model reaches 30%, establishing state-of-the-art performance among models of 2 comparable scale (see Figure 1). 2.

[ 1 7 2 2 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract Text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable progress, yet existing methods often lack the ability to dynamically reason and refine during generationa hallmark of human creativity. Current reasoning-augmented paradigms mostly rely on explicit thought processes, where intermediate reasoning is decoded into discrete text at fixed steps with frequent image decoding and reencoding, leading to inefficiencies, information loss, and cognitive mismatches. To bridge this gap, we introduce LatentMorph, novel framework that seamlessly integrates implicit latent reasoning into the T2I generation process. At its core, LatentMorph introduces four lightweight components: (i) condenser for summarizing intermediate generation states into compact visual memory, (ii) translator for converting latent thoughts into actionable guidance, (iii) shaper for dynamically steering next image token predictions, and (iv) an RL-trained invoker for adaptively determining when to invoke reasoning. By performing reasoning entirely in continuous latent spaces, LatentMorph avoids the bottlenecks of explicit reasoning and enables more adaptive selfrefinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LatentMorph (I) enhances the base model Janus-Pro by 16% on GenEval and 25% on T2ICompBench; (II) outperforms explicit paradigms (e.g., TwiG) by 15% and 11% on abstract reasoning tasks like WISE and IPV-Txt, (III) while reducing inference time by 44% and token consumption by 51%; and (IV) exhibits 71% cognitive alignment with human intuition on reasoning invocation.

However, current approaches face critical trade-off: text-based WMs sacrifice visual fidelity, while the inability of visual WMs in precise text rendering led to their reliance on slow, complex pipelines dependent on numerous external models. We propose novel paradigm: visual world modeling via renderable code generation, where single Vision-Language Model (VLM) predicts the next GUI state as executable web code that renders to pixels, rather than generating pixels directly. This combines the strengths of both approaches: VLMs retain their linguistic priors for precise text rendering while their pre-training on structured web code enables high-fidelity visual generation. We introduce gWorld (8B, 32B), the first open-weight visual mobile GUI WMs built on this paradigm, along with data generation framework that automatically synthesizes code-based training data. In extensive evaluation across 4 in-distribution and 2 out-of-distribution benchmarks, gWorld sets new pareto frontier in accuracy versus model size, outperforming 8 frontier open-weight models over 50.25 larger. Further analyses show that (1) scaling training data yields meaningful gains, (2) each component of our pipeline improves data quality, and (3) stronger world modeling improves downstream mobile GUI policy performance.

The existing pareto frontier was defined by Qwen3 VL 8B, 32B, and GLM 4.6V 106B. Notably, extremely large models (e.g., Llama 4 402B) do not reach this pareto frontier, while text-image-to-image models (e.g., Emu3.5 34B) struggle with mobile GUI dynamics. area (Wang et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025b; Nguyen et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025; Niu et al., 2025), driven by the ubiquitous nature of mobile computing, with an estimated 8.9 billion mobile subscriptions worldwide (Ericsson, 2025). An emerging line of literature demonstrates that leveraging generative mobile World Model (WM) to predict future states can significantly enhance policy performance during both training (Fang et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025) and inference (Chae et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2025; Gu et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025c; Cao et al., 2026). While these approaches yield substantial gains, they predict the next state in text; an abstraction over the pixel-space GUI state. This abstraction discards critical GUI information, including fine-grained spatial layout and visual attributes (e.g., iconography, typography, and color) (Chae et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2025; Cao et al., 2026). Moreover, text-only world representations limit Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based policies, which have been shown to outperform languageonly models on mobile GUI tasks (Hong et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024; Gou et al., 2025). In response, VIMO (Luo et al., 2025) introduced the first visual mobile GUI WM and showed that visual world modeling yields larger policy Figure 2. Mobile GUI world modeling via renderable code. Given an image state St and action At, the model predicts the next state St+1. Our model, gWorld, generates renderable web code to ensure pixel-perfect text and structurally accurate layouts. In contrast, image-gen baselines (e.g., Qwen-Image-Edit 20B) struggle with the discrete nature of GUIs, frequently producing illegible text and distorted layouts. See Appendix Fig. 13, 14, 15 for additional qualitative examples. improvements than text-based alternatives. However, we observe three notable disadvantages of VIMO. First, VIMO relies on complex multi-stage pipeline rather than single self-contained model, resulting in significant computational overhead and latency (Luo et al., 2025; Cao et al., 2026). Concretely, their framework uses (1) an external Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model for text detection, (2) box-based text masking, (3) an external frontier VLM (GPT-4o) to filter masked regions, (4) customtrained diffusion model to generate the next-state image, and (5) two additional GPT-4o calls to fill in next-state text. Second, their formulation converts coordinate-based actions into natural-language instructions via GPT-4o, effectively outsourcing visual grounding to closed-weight model. Lastly, VIMO does not release the weights of its custom-trained diffusion model, making the system difficult to reproduce and deploy. In response, we present gWorld (8B, Contribution. 32B), which to our knowledge, are the first open-weight, single self-contained world models specialized for visual mobile GUI world modeling that operates via renderable code generation. We start by analyzing the limitations of using image-generation model for mobile GUI World Models ( 2.2), with further detailed analysis in 4.3. To alleviate this, we show for the first time that code-based representation can be leveraged for mobile GUI World Models ( 2.3). As there are no code-based GUI world modeling training datasets, we present our data generation framework ( 2.4). Specifically, we repurpose offline mobile-agent trajectories into (St, At)-conditioned next-state pairs, automatically converts St+1 from pixels to renderable web code, and adds free look-ahead reasoning traces, producing large-scale SFT data for training code-generating GUI WMs. Furthermore, due to the lack of comprehensive visual mobile GUI world modeling benchmarks, we present MWMBENCH, curating and open-sourcing four inand two out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks to evaluate mobile GUI WMs ( 3, Tab. 1). We empirically demonstrate that our data generation framework and model is effective: Our models outperform 8 frontier open-weight imageand code-generation models up to 50.25 larger, across 6 inand out-of-distribution benchmarks ( 4.2, Fig. 1, Tab. 2).

[ 1 2 2 3 1 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as promising method for interpreting neural network representations by decomposing activations into sparse combinations of dictionary atoms. However, SAEs assume that features combine additively through linear reconstruction, an assumption that cannot capture compositional structure: linear models cannot distinguish whether Starbucks arises from the composition of star and coffee features or merely their co-occurrence. This forces SAEs to allocate monolithic features for compound concepts rather than decomposing them into interpretable constituents. We introduce PolySAE, which extends the SAE decoder with higher-order terms to model feature interactions while preserving the linear encoder essential for interpretability. Through low-rank tensor factorization on shared projection subspace, PolySAE captures pairwise and triple feature interactions with small parameter overhead (3% on GPT2). Across four language models and three SAE variants, PolySAE achieves an average improvement of approximately 8% in probing F1 while maintaining comparable reconstruction error, and produces 210 larger Wasserstein distances between class-conditional feature distributions. Critically, learned interaction weights exhibit negligible correlation with co-occurrence frequency (r = 0.06 vs. = 0.82 for SAE feature covariance), suggesting that polynomial terms capture compositional structure, such as morphological binding and phrasal composition, largely independent of surface statistics. 1The Cyprus Institute 2University of Athens 3University of Oxford 4Archimedes AI/Athena Research Center 5University of Cyprus.

Introduction As AI systems are increasingly deployed in real-world domains, ensuring their safety and reliability has become critical challenge (Amodei et al., 2016; Hendrycks et al., 2021; Bengio et al., 2025). Developing interpretable models offers promising path towards aligning AI with human values: understanding why model produces given output enables us to (i) monitor its reasoning (Lindsey et al., 2025), (ii) debug failure modes (Wong et al., 2021), and (iii) steer away from unwanted behavior (Rimsky et al., 2024). Mechanistic interpretability pursues this agenda at the level of neural network internals (Bereska & Gavves, 2024), aiming to uncover interpretable features and circuits within model and thereby provide principled insights into its behavior. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), grounded in the principles of sparse dictionary learning, have emerged as leading tool for mechanistic interpretability. SAEs decompose neural network activations to recover human-interpretable features that models typically represent in superpositionencoded in overlapping directions due to limited representational capacity (Elhage et al., 2022). This framework has been shown to uncover safety-relevant concepts such as deception, bias, and harmful content, enabling targeted interventions that predictably steer model behavior (Templeton et al., 2024). PolySAE: Modeling Feature Interactions in Sparse Autoencoders via Polynomial Decoding Figure 2. An overview of PolySAE: (1) sparse latent features are first extracted with standard SAE encoder. (2) Activations in the residual stream are then reconstructed by modeling 2ndand 3rd-order interactions in addition to the standard linear component. The example Investing.com Philippines stocks were higher after comes from Table 4. However, recent work has highlighted fundamental limitations of the SAE paradigm due to their reliance on the strong linear representation hypothesis (Engels et al., 2025; Csordás et al., 2024). Standard SAEs reconstruct activations as weighted sums of independent features, expressing each activation as linear combination where features contribute additively. This linearity assumption raises fundamental question: what level of abstraction do learned features naturally capture? The answer has direct implications for mechanistic interpretability. If features truly combine linearly, we would expect individual dictionary atoms to represent atomic components, such as morphemes, simple concepts, or basic semantic primitives, that combine through superposition to form complex expressions. Such atomic features would enable transparent circuit analysis and precise interventions on elemental building blocks of meaning. Yet linguistic theory demonstrates that composition operates non-linearly across multiple levels of language structure. Morphologically, administrators is not simply the sum of stem and suffix; the combination produces distinct lexical item with specific syntactic and semantic properties (Haspelmath & Sims, 2013). Semantically, phrasal meanings such as kick the bucket or proper names like Starbucks (Figure 1) exhibit emergent properties irreducible to their parts (Partee, 1995). Vanilla SAEs demonstrably succeed at many interpretability tasks, yet their linear reconstruction mechanism cannot, in principle, represent nonlinear composition. Without explicit interaction mechanisms, SAEs cannot simultaneously represent atomic features and their non-linear compositions. When Starbucks appears in context, linear model must either (i) allocate dedicated feature for this compositional entity, sacrificing atomicity, or (ii) represent it through separate star and coffee features that cannot distinguish this specific composition from mere co-occurrence. Ideally, SAEs with sufficient capacit"

Code: github.com/xbench-ai Data: huggingface.co/xbench-ai Correspondence: team@xbench.orgAI agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently exhibited remarkable progress in autonomous reasoning, planning, and tool usage. Although agents have achieved success in handling increasingly complex tasks within vertical domains like vibe coding (Jimenez et al., 2023; Zan et al., 2025), deep research (Wei et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025) and complex problem solving (Phan et al., 2025), these advancements are not yet fully palpable to ordinary users. We posit that current evaluations lack the necessary diversity to reflect real-world scenarios across work, life, and learning. Addressing this gap, we propose AgentIF-OneDay, framework to assess the efficacy of AI agents in assisting general users with daily tasks through language instructions. AgentIF-OneDay demands the delivery, analysis, and modification of comprehensive work outputs, structured around three key dimensions: * Equal contribution. 1 1. Open Workflow Execution: These tasks assess the agents ability to execute automated processes precisely and exhaustively when the user provides clear and detailed operational procedure. This tests the agents robustness in long-context processing, avoidance of "instruction forgetting," and suppression of hallucinations. 2. Latent Instruction Inference: This dimension requires the agent to autonomously induce and infer implicit, unstated general rules or constraints from task attachments and apply them to new tasks. 3. Iterative Refinement: These tasks simulate multi-turn, progressive collaborative process between the user and the agent. The agent must perform precise content updates and adjustments based on supplementary or corrective instructions from the user upon existing outputs, measuring the efficacy of its state maintenance and human-machine collaboration. We control the distribution of topics in the evaluation set to balance alignment with authentic user needs and maximization of task diversity. The former includes common demands such as daily office software usage, life planning, and research, helping us understand the correlation between agent capabilities and real-world value. The latter primarily increases the difficulty of "hack" evaluation metrics through out-of-domain tasks, including game strategy research and the automation of scientific research workflows. Beyond manually annotated tasks, we designed File-centered Automated Agentic Pipeline for task generation. We utilize the ChatGPT agent to collect information-dense attachments with high potential for question generation. Using human-annotated tasks as seeds, we extract and augment workflow frameworks. Finally, we synthesize the attachments and workflows to produce AgentIF-OneDay evaluation items that are logically coherent and deeply correlated with the attachment information. Furthermore, this methodology is extensible to broader agentic data synthesis applications. We employ Instance-level rubrics for evaluation and have enhanced the consistency between LLM-based Verifiers and human scoring through pipeline design. For instance, we implemented visual parsing for PPT and HTML files and utilized Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as verifiers. Additionally, for rubrics requiring real-time verification, the model defaults to Search Mode. The utilization of superior multimodal foundation models has significantly improved the accuracy of the discriminator. When employing Gemini-3-Pro as the judge model, the consistency between AgentIF-OneDay scoring points and human scoring reaches 80.6%. AgentIF-OneDay comprises 104 tasks and covers 767 scoring points. Through systematic testing and analysis of mainstream AI agent products on this benchmark, we aim to reveal the strengths and bottlenecks of current agent products and agentic models, providing empirically valuable references for the future optimization of AI agents. Simultaneously, the high-quality, finely annotated instruction data accumulated by AgentIF-OneDay holds significant potential as training data for reinforcement learning.Instruction Following Benchmarks. Instruction following benchmarks are crucial for evaluating the ability of large language models to execute tasks based on specific instructions. For instance, IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023) assesses models capability using set of verifiable instructions to ensure accuracy. Another notable benchmark, FOFO (Xia et al., 2024), classifies tasks into various domains and imposes specific format requirements, such as "

Text:"Thinking with Comics: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning through Structured Visual Storytelling Andong Chen 1 Wenxin Zhu 1 Qiuyu Ding 1 Yuchen Song 1 Muyun Yang 1 Tiejun Zhao 1 Website: https://thinking-with-comics.github.io/ Repository: https://github.com/andongBlue/Think-with-Comics.Chain-of-Thought reasoning has driven large language models to extend from thinking with text to thinking with images and videos. However, different modalities still have clear limitations: static images struggle to represent temporal structure, while videos introduce substantial redundancy and computational cost. In this work, we propose Thinking with Comics, visual reasoning paradigm that uses comics as high information-density medium positioned between images and videos. Comics preserve temporal structure, embedded text, and narrative coherence while requiring significantly lower reasoning cost. We systematically study two reasoning paths based on comics and evaluate them on range of reasoning tasks and long-context understanding tasks. Experimental results show that Thinking with Comics outperforms Thinking with Images on multi-step temporal and causal reasoning tasks, while remaining substantially more efficient than Thinking with Video. Further analysis indicates that different comic narrative structures and styles consistently affect performance across tasks, suggesting that comics serve as an effective intermediate visual representation for improving multimodal reasoning. 6 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 3 5 4 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their reasoning ability on complex tasks by adopting explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Besta et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2023), making stepby-step textual reasoning (Think with text) common 1Harbin Institute of Technology. Correspondence to: Andong Chen <ands691119@gmail.com>, Tiejun Zhao <tjzhao@hit.edu.cn>. Preprint. February 2026. Copyright 2026 by the author(s). paradigm. With the development of multimodal large language models (MLLM), this idea of explicit reasoning has extended from pure text to the visual domain. Under the Thinking with Images (TWI) paradigm (Hurst et al., 2024; Ope; Zhang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025), models not only use images as input signals but also generate intermediate visual representations during reasoning to supplement critical visual information (Li et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2024), thereby improving the reasoning performance of visionlanguage models (VLMs). Building on this, Thinking with Video further introduces temporal structure by generating short video sequences, enabling more complex forms of dynamic reasoning (Tong et al., 2025). Despite the extension of reasoning paradigms from text to images and videos, each modality still exhibits clear limitations. Static images struggle to represent temporal structure and dynamic processes, while the absence of explicit textual cues complicates cross-modal alignment. Videos provide temporal information but introduce substantial redundancy and significantly higher computational overhead, which limits their practical efficiency for reasoning. To address these limitations, we turn to more natural reasoning medium from daily life-comics-and introduce the Thinking with Comics (TwC) paradigm. Comics are distinctive narrative form. Compared with static images, they retain most key properties of video, including temporal logic, embedded text, and dynamic reasoning (Augereau et al., 2017). Yet compared with video, each panel is more information-dense and requires far lower reasoning cost. Recent generative models such as Gemini-3 Pro Image (Google DeepMind, 2025) can convert long text into coherent sequential panels while embedding text naturally within images. This allows comics to combine the highdensity reasoning benefits of images with the dynamic logic of video. Thus, Thinking with Comics has strong potential to expand visual reasoning into new research direction. To comprehensively explore this field, we adopted two paths of Thinking with Comics, namely End-to-End Visualized Thinking with Comics: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning through Structured Visual Storytelling Figure 1. The selected reasoning tasks and (Long) Context Understanding tasks, along with the Thinking with Comics solution based on Gemini-3 Pro Image. The reasoning tasks primarily involve mathematical and logical reasoning, while the (Long) Context Understanding tasks require the model to comprehend cultural contexts, documents, and other extended information. The model provides the reasoning process and correct answers within the generated comic panels. Reasoning and Comic as Conditioning Context for VLM. Then we evaluate our method on mainstream generalpurpose benchmarks across two task types, as shown in Figure 1: (1) reasoning tasks and (2) (long) context understanding tasks. In the evaluation, we test the two paths and compare them with leading MLLMs as well as models that following the paradigms of Thinking with Text, Thinking with Images, and Thinking with Video. The results show that comics, as form of structured visual storytelling, consistently yield systematic performance gains across different tasks. Further analysis reveals that: (1) different tasks benefit from different role-playing narrative structures in comicsfor example, detective-style narratives are better suited for logical reasoning tasks, while culture-centric narratives are more effective for cultural understanding; (2) Thinking with Comics exhibits scaling behavior similar to Chainof-Thought, where more difficult tasks require larger number of comic panels to support reasoning; (3) comic panels exhibit clear temporal and logical dependencies, and disrupting or permuting their order leads to noticeable performance degradation; (4) embedded textual elements in comics, such as dialogue and narration, work jointly with visual cues to reduce semantic ambiguity in purely visual reasoning; and (5) compared to Thinking with Video, Thinking with Comics achieves substantially lower inference cost while preserving essential temporal structure. These findings indicate that visual expression still offers substantial room for exploration, and that comics provide new reasoning medium positioned between static images and videos. We hope this work will inspire further exploration of Thinking with paradigms and help establish comics as an important component"

Unlike existing methods that rely on static rubrics or disjoint training pipelines, our approach treats rubric generation as latent action learned to maximize judgment accuracy. We introduce an alternating optimization strategy to mitigate the non-stationarity of simultaneous updates, providing theoretical analysis that demonstrates how this schedule reduces gradient variance during training.

In this research, we show that current RL pipelines for FMs suffer from two underappreciated yet important limitations: sample inefficiency due to insufficient generation diversity, and pronounced prompt overfitting, where models memorize specific training formulations and exhibit dramatic performance collapse when evaluated on semantically equivalent but stylistically varied prompts. We present PromptRL (Prompt Matters in RL for Flow-Based Image Generation), framework that incorporates language models (LMs) as trainable prompt refinement agents directly within the flow-based RL optimization loop. This design yields two complementary benefits: rapid development of sophisticated prompt rewriting capabilities and, critically, synergistic training regime that reshapes the optimization dynamics. PromptRL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, obtaining scores of 0.97 on GenEval, 0.98 on OCR accuracy, and 24.05 on PickScore. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our RL approach on large-scale image editing models, improving the EditReward of FLUX.1-Kontext from 1.19 to 1.43 with only 0.06 million rollouts, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (also known as Nano Banana), which scores 1.37, and achieving comparable performance with ReasonNet (1.44), which relied on fine-grained data annotations along with complex multi-stage training.

Our code is available at https://github.com/G-U-N/UniRL. 1. Introduction The advent of flow matching models (FMs) (Liu et al., 2022; Lipman et al., 2022; Labs, 2024; Song et al., 2020) has transformed text-to-image (T2I) generation, enabling photorealistic synthesis from natural language descriptions. To align these models with human preferences and specific reward objectives, reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton, 2018; Fan et al., 2023; Black et al., 2023) has become the standard posttraining mechanism, refining model behavior beyond the scope of supervised pretraining. Despite these advances, applying RL to FMs remains prohibitively sample-inefficient. Our investigation reveals two underappreciated yet critical failure modes in current flow-based RL pipelines. (i) First, we observe counterintuitive exploration paradox: as T2I models improve at following prompts precisely, they simultaneously lose generative diversity under identical prompts. This increased prompt adherence constrains the behavioral variation necessary for effective RL exploration, causing optimization to stagnate in narrow modes of the generation space. (ii) Second, we identify severe prompt overfitting, where models learn to exploit superficial linguistic patterns in training prompts rather than developing genuine visual understanding. This overfitting manifests as dramatic performance collapse when models encounter semantically equivalent prompts phrased with different syntax at test time. This makes prompt enhancement (PE) (Hao et al., 2023; Rosenman et al., 2024; Manas et al., 2024; Mo et al., 2024), crucial technique for improving generation quality, ineffective or even counterproductive for RL-finetuned FMs. We provide detailed empirical evidence for both phenomena in Section 3. These limitations expose fundamental design oversight in existing approaches: treating prompts as fixed inputs rather than malleable components of the optimization process. Naive augmentation techniques such as random synonym substitution or rule-based paraphrasing prove inadequate, often failing to generate semantically coherent variations at scale. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that large language models (LMs), when trained as adaptive co-learners PromptRL: Prompt Matters in RL for Flow-Based Image Generation Figure 1. Overview of the PromptRL framework. PromptRL jointly trains language model and flow-matching image generator within unified RL loop. Given an original prompt (and optionally reference image), the LM produces semantically grounded prompt variants that expand the exploration space beyond fixed-prompt training. These prompts are paired with independent noise samples and passed to the flow-matching model to generate diverse images. mixture of reward functions evaluates each image and guides the evolution of the LM (for improved prompt rewriting) and the FM (for improved visual generation). via joint RL, can generate semantically grounded prompt variations that enhance exploration efficiency and serve as co-trained PE module in practical deployment. We introduce PromptRL (Prompt Matters in RL), framework that integrates LMs as adaptive co-learners within flow-based RL training loops, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Rather than employing LMs as static preprocessors, we train them to generate prompt variations that simultaneously preserve semantic intent and maximize downstream image generation rewards. This creates mutually beneficial training dynamic: diverse LM-generated prompts expand the exploration space for FMs, accelerating policy improvement, while reward signals from flow model outputs guide LMs toward discovering linguistically varied yet contextually appropriate reformulations. Our experimental results demonstrate that PromptRL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, obtaining scores of 0.97 on GenEval (Ghosh et al., 2023), 0.98 on OCR accuracy (Cui et al., 2025), and 24.05 on PickScore (Kirstain et al., 2023). Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our RL approach on large-scale image editing models, improving EditReward (Wu et al., 2025b) of FLUX.1-Kontext (Labs et al., 2025) from 1.19 to 1.43 with only 0.06 million rollouts.

In this paper, we identify sparse reward subsystem within the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs), drawing an analogy to the biological reward subsystem in the human brain. We demonstrate that this subsystem contains value neurons that represent the models internal expectation of state value, and through intervention experiments, we establish the importance of these neurons for reasoning. Our experiments reveal that these value neurons are robust across diverse datasets, model scales, and architectures; furthermore, they exhibit significant transferability across different datasets and models fine-tuned from the same base model. By examining cases where value predictions and actual rewards diverge, we identify dopamine neurons within the reward subsystem which encode reward prediction errors (RPE). These neurons exhibit high activation when the reward is higher than expected and low activation when the reward is lower than expected. 1. Introduction In recent years, the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant breakthroughs, even surpassing human expert levels in various mathematical and scientific tasks (Singh et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025a). Parallel to the continuous pursuit of higher performance, researchers seek to understand the underlying reasoning mechanisms of these models. Recent studies reveal that LLM hidden states encode rich information, which can be leveraged for weighted learning (Oh et al., 2025), predicting confidence and answer correctness (Gekhman et al., 2025), detecting hallucinations (Zhang et al., 2025a), and performing implicit reasoning (Chen et al., 2024). However, most existing work focuses primarily on utilizing the information present in hidden states, while few studies analyze the intrinsic properties of the hidden states themselves or attempt to 1Tsinghua University 2Stanford University. Correspondence to: James Zou <jamesz@stanford.edu>. Preprint. February 3, 2026. 1 In this paper, we find that the ability of LLM hidden states to predict confidence and correctness can be attributed to the existence of small subset of neurons that encode the value information of the current state. This hypothesis is inspired by biological concepts. In neuroscience, the human brain contains reward subsystem composed of small number of neurons that govern how humans explore and learn from their environment. Value neurons and dopamine neurons are two critical types of neurons within this system. Value neurons are primarily identified in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of human and other primate brains, which are known to represent the subjective value of stimuli during decisionmaking (Tremblay & Schultz, 1999; Padoa-Schioppa & Assad, 2006). Meanwhile, dopamine neurons are mainly located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Their core function is to encode the Reward Prediction Error (RPE), the phenomenon where neuronal activation increases when the brain receives higher reward than expected and decreases when the reward falls short of expectations (Schultz, 1998). We demonstrate that similar reward subsystem exists within LLM hidden states, where sparse set of neurons performs functions analogous to biological value and dopamine neurons. Specifically, value neurons represent the models own expectation of the current states value, while the activation levels of dopamine neurons correlate closely with the discrepancy between the actual reward and the models expectation. In the following sections, we first introduce the value neurons within the LLM reward subsystem and describe how to identify their distribution across model layers. Through intervention experiments, we observe that value neurons exert significant influence on the models reasoning capabilities. Specifically, zeroing out the hidden states of even small fraction of value neurons results in substantial performance degradation, whereas randomly zeroing out the same proportion of neurons yields no such effect. Next, we systematically demonstrate the robustness and transferability of these value neurons, showing that they are universal across various datasets (GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH500 (Lightman et al., 2023), Minerva Math (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), ARC (Clark et al., 2018), MMLU STEM (Hendrycks et al., 2021)), model scales (0.5B, 7B, 14B), layers, and archiSparse Reward Subsystem in Large Language Models tectural designs (Qwen (Bai et al., 2023), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), Phi (Gunasekar et al., 2023), Gemma (Team et al., 2024)). Furthermore, we show that the distribution of these value neurons remain consistent across different models derived from the same base model, as well as across diverse datasets. Subsequently, we identify dopamine neurons by examining cases where value predictions and actual rewards diverge. Through case studies, we demonstrate that these dopamine neurons indeed exhibit high activation when the reward is higher than expected and low activation when the reward is lower than expected. In summary, our key contributions are: We identify reward subsystem in LLM hidden states analogous to that of the human brain. Within this subsystem, small subset of neurons acts as value neurons, representing the models value expectation for the current state, while another subset acts as dopamine neurons, whose activation levels reflect the reward prediction error. Intervention experiments reveal that value neurons are critical for reasoning. Ablating even small subset of these neurons severely impairs performance. We demonstrate the robustness of the value neurons across diverse datasets, model scales, and architectures. We demonstrate the transferability of the value neurons across different models derived from the same base model and across diverse datasets. 2. Sparse Value Neurons in Large LanguageOur study focuses on autoregressive large language models. By analyzing the characteristics of hidden states during generation, we demonstrate that large language models exhibit sparse reward subsystem within their hidden states that encodes information regarding value (value neurons, Section 2.3) and prediction error (dopamine neurons, Section 4.1). In this section, we first introduce value neurons. During the gen"

World models learn an internal representation of environment dynamics, enabling agents to simulate and reason about future states within compact latent space for tasks such as planning, prediction, and inference. However, running world models rely on hevay computational cost and memory footprint, making model quantization essential for efficient deployment. To date, the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ) on world models remain largely unexamined. In this work, we present systematic empirical study of world model quantization using DINO-WM as representative case, evaluating diverse PTQ methods under both weight-only and joint weight-activation settings. We conduct extensive experiments on different visual planning tasks across wide range of bit-widths, quantization granularities, and planning horizons up to 50 iterations. Our results show that quantization effects in world models extend beyond standard accuracy and bit-width trade-offs: group-wise weight quantization can stabilize low-bit rollouts, activation quantization granularity yields inconsistent benefits, and quantization sensitivity is highly asymmetric between encoder and predictor modules. Moreover, aggressive low-bit quantization significantly degrades the alignment between the planning objective and task success, leading to failures that cannot be remedied by additional optimization. These findings reveal distinct quantization-induced failure modes in world model-based planning and provide practical guidance for deploying quantized world models under strict computational constraints. The code will be available at https: //github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/QuantWM.

The symbolic nature of structured 3D scene representations could arguably enhance spatial intelligence, enabling more efficient understanding of our 3D world. Yet this perspective is controversial, since many in the community remain unconvinced, citing the limited reconstruction quality of current methods. In this paper, we focus on two key primitives, rectangular planes and line segments, with the goal of achieving accurate, complete, and detailed 3D line mapping1 for man-made environments. The problem of 3D line mapping has been extensively studied through two-view matching [9], [10] and multi-view tracking of 2D line segments, using pipeline analogous to 3D point mapping. However, due to the fundamental differences between line segments and points, establishing reliable line correspondences remains challenging. recent approach, LIMAP [1], attempts to mitigate this issue by considering the top line matches instead of single match, thereby improving the chance of correct correspondences while pruning incorrect ones. Although LIMAP [1] significantly outperforms Line3D++ [3], it is limited by strong dependence on dense viewpoints to achieve successful line triangulation.

This terminology is borrowed from LIMAP [1], and this task is also referred to as 3D line reconstruction. ing the potential for matching-free formulations. However, they suffer from the slow optimization process due to their reliance on neural fields. To construct reliable 3D line map from 2D line detections across multiple views, two key ingredients are required: robust cross-view correspondences and accurate spatial placement of the reconstructed 3D lines. common strategy is to utilize an existing surface reconstruction from multi-view inputs with known camera poses and to project detected 2D lines onto the surface using depth maps. However, this approach often fails in practice, as illustrated in Fig. 1. On one hand, view-dependent parallax can cause single image line to correspond to multiple 3D line segments at different depths. On the other hand, inconsistencies in the depth maps can introduce spurious structural lines. Because true 3D lines are inherently inseparable from structural surface edges, joint recovery of surfaces and edges is indispensable, motivating novel formulation of 3D line mapping that explicitly models the geometric relationship and interaction between planes and line segments. Planar representations offer promising opportunity. PlanarSplatting [8] reconstructs structured scene surfaces by optimizing set of learnable planar primitives. This formulation is attractive because plane boundaries are naturally formed by lines, revealing direct geometric and topological link between surfaces and 3D line structures. However, PlanarSplatting is designed for surface reconstruction only, without explicitly connecting multi-view 2D line detections to the learned primitives. Thus, we explore how to associate 2D line segments with 3D planar edges and leverage these associations to reconstruct reliable, consistent 3D line maps. We therefore propose LiP-Map, which explicitly exploits the interaction between planes and lines to recover reliable and consistent 3D line maps. The name stands for LinePlane Joint Optimization for 3D line mapping. Our approach leverages the geometric synergy between line segments and the edges of 3D planar primitives.

PISA at higher sparsity ratio r=85% preserves better quality and structure than SpargeAttn (Zhang et al., 2025b).Diffusion Transformers are fundamental for video and image generation, but their efficiency is bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of attention. While block sparse attention accelerates computation by attending only critical key-value blocks, it suffers from degradation at high sparsity by discarding context. In this work, we discover that attention scores of non-critical blocks exhibit distributional stability, allowing them to be approximated accurately and efficiently rather than discarded, which is essentially important for sparse attention design. Motivated by this key insight, we propose PISA, training-free Piecewise 1The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). Correspondence to: Zeke Xie <zekexie@hkustgz.edu.cn>. Preprint. February 3, 2026. 1 Sparse Attention that covers the full attention span with sub-quadratic complexity. Unlike the conventional keep-or-drop paradigm that directly drop the non-critical block information, PISA introduces novel exact-or-approximate strategy: it maintains exact computation for critical blocks while efficiently approximating the remainder through block-wise Taylor expansion. This design allows PISA to serve as faithful proxy to full attention, effectively bridging the gap between speed and quality. Experimental results demonstrate that PISA achieves 1.91 and 2.57 speedups on Wan2.1-14B and Hunyuan-Video, respectively, while consistently maintaining the highest quality among sparse attention methods. Notably, even for image generation on FLUX, PISA achieves 1.2 acceleration without compromising visual quality. Code is available. PISA: Piecewise Sparse Attention Is Wiser for Efficient Diffusion Transformers 1. Introduction Sparse Attention Full Attention PISA (Ours) Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) (Peebles & Xie, 2023) have demonstrated impressive performance and scalability in generating high-fidelity images and videos, leading to their widespread adoption across diverse visual generation tasks (Arnab et al., 2021; Hong et al., 2022; Wan et al., 2025). However, as the demand for higher resolutions and longer video durations grows, the sequence length of input tokens increases dramatically. Consequently, the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017) becomes significant bottleneck, resulting in prohibitively low inference efficiency for large-scale DiTs. To address the computational bottleneck, especially in highresolution image and video generation, recent research has leveraged the inherent sparsity in DiTs to enable sparse attention. Early works (Zhang et al., 2025d; Xi et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025) capitalized on the spatiotemporal redundancy of video diffusion transformers to introduce static, training-free sparse attention patterns. To improve adaptability, other methods (Zhang et al., 2025b; Xu et al., 2025; Xia et al., 2025) propose computing sparse patterns dynamically at runtime. Moving beyond training-free approaches, methods such as VSA (Zhang et al., 2025c) and Radial Attention (Li et al., 2025) have explored trainable sparse attention; works like SANA (Xie et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025) and Linfusion (Liu et al., 2024) have adopted linear attention for efficient generation, while methods such as SLA (Zhang et al., 2025a) have made preliminary attempts to combine sparse and linear attention. However, existing methods still face inherent limitations: (1) Hard truncation: Sparse attention directly discards keyvalue pairs, leading to performance drops at high sparsity and inefficiency on shorter sequences (e.g., 4K tokens). (2) Incompatibility with pre-trained weights: Linear and hybrid attention fundamentally alter the attention distribution of pre-trained models, precluding the direct reuse of weights and necessitating expensive retraining. These limitations underscore the need for unified mechanism that enhances efficiency without sacrificing quality or requiring retraining. To this end, we propose PISA, novel training-free sparse attention that accelerates DiTs while maintaining high accuracy through piecewise computation. Unlike standard sparse attention, which computes only critical blocks and discards the rest, PISA treats attention as piecewise process: (1) Exact computation for sparse key-value blocks to preserve critical information; (2) Approximation for the remaining blocks using block-wise Taylor expansion to cover the massive amount of non-critical information. Specifically, we propose hybrid-order approximation strategy that uses block-wise zero-order expansion and global first-order approximation to efficiently improve accuracy. This enables PISA to significantly enhance approximation fidelity relActive Blocks: 20% Active Blocks: 100% Active Blocks: 100% FLOPs: 20.0% L1 Error: 10.34% FLOPs: 100% L1 Error: 0% FLOPs: 20.4% L1 Error: 1.36% Figure 2.

Text:"Evaluating Deep Data Research on LLMs Hunt Instead of Wait: Evaluating Deep Data Research on Large Language Models Wei Liu, Peijie Yu, Michele Orini, Yali Du, Yulan He Kings College London, Tencent, The Alan Turing Institute Abstract: The agency expected of Agentic Large Language Models goes beyond answering correctly, requiring autonomy to set goals and decide what to explore. We term this investigatory intelligence, distinguishing it from executional intelligence, which merely completes assigned tasks. Data Science provides natural testbed, as real-world analysis starts from raw data rather than explicit queries, yet few benchmarks focus on it. To address this, we introduce Deep Data Research (DDR), an open-ended task where LLMs autonomously extract key insights from databases, and DDR-Bench, large-scale, checklist-based benchmark that enables verifiable evaluation. Results show that while frontier models display emerging agency, long-horizon exploration remains challenging. Our analysis highlights that effective investigatory intelligence depends not only on agent scaffolding or merely scaling, but also on intrinsic strategies of agentic models.

[ 1 7 9 9 1 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Recent works have shown that layer pruning can compress large language models (LLMs) while retaining strong performance on classification benchmarks with little or no finetuning. However, existing pruning techniques often suffer severe degradation on generative reasoning tasks. Through systematic study across multiple model families, we find that tasks requiring multi-step reasoning are particularly sensitive to depth reduction. Beyond surface-level text degeneration, we observe degradation of critical algorithmic capabilities, including arithmetic computation for mathematical reasoning and balanced parenthesis generation for code synthesis. Under realistic post-training constraints, without access to pretraining-scale data or compute, we evaluate simple mitigation strategy based on supervised finetuning with Self-Generated Responses. This approach achieves strong recovery on classification tasks, retaining up to 90% of baseline performance, and yields substantial gains of up to 20 30 percentage points on generative benchmarks compared to prior post-pruning techniques. Crucially, despite these gains, recovery for generative reasoning remains fundamentally limited relative to classification tasks and is viable primarily at lower pruning ratios. Overall, we characterize the practical limits of layer pruning for generative reasoning and provide guidance on when depth reduction can be applied effectively under constrained post-training regimes. 1 2 *Equal contribution 1Department of Computer Science, New York University Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, UAE.

However, the scale of modern LLMs raises significant concerns regarding efficiency and costs (LeCun et al., 1989; Wan et al., 2023; Song et al., 2024). These challenges have motivated substantial body of work on model compression techniques aimed at reducing model size while preserving performance, including pruning at multiple granularities ranging from individual neurons to entire layers (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023; Sun et al., 2024; Muralidharan et al., 2024; Sreenivas et al., 2024; Song et al., 2024; Ashkboos et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2023; Ling et al., 2024). Among these approaches, layer pruning has emerged as particularly appealing strategy. By removing entire transformer blocks of contemporary decoder-only models, layer pruning offers simple method for reducing model depth, often requiring minimal or no additional finetuning (Song et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024; Men et al., 2025; Kim et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024). This approach is further motivated by theoretical and empirical works suggesting redundancy across layers in LLMs (Sun et al., 2025; Lad et al., 2024; Men et al., 2025). Furthermore, layer pruning is largely orthogonal to other efficiency techniques such as quantization and sparsification, enabling it to be combined with complementary methods for additional computational savings (Song et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024). While this approach has achieved notable success in classification benchmarks, it has proven far less effective for reasoning-intensive generative tasks like math and coding, which require the model to generate multi-step chain of thought to arrive at the correct solution (Lu et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Men et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024; Nepal et al., 2025). Prior work has largely attributed the failure of layer pruning on generative tasks to the importance of deeper layers for reasoning, without explicitly characterizing how layer removal degrades model behavior (Wang et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025). Moreover, existing methods that partially recover generative performance typically rely on knowledge distillation with large-scale data (inbillions of tokens) and compute, which can be impractical (Muralidharan et al., 2024; Sreenivas et al., 2024). These limitations motivate closer analysis of pruning-induced failure modes and an examination of how much recovery is achievable under realistic post-training constraints. Rather than proposing new pruning algorithm, our goal is to characterize the limits of layer pruning for generative reasoning and to identify practical regimes in which it remains viable. of layers (Yang et al., 2024; Men et al., 2025; Gromov et al., 2024; Song et al., 2024). However, this success has not consistently extended to generative reasoning tasks such as GSM8K, which require multi-step generation to arrive at correct solution (Chen et al., 2024; Men et al., 2025; Gromov et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025). This discrepancy raises questions about the extent to which layers are redundant across different task contexts. In this paper, we make the following contributions: We demonstrate that generative reasoning tasks are substantially more sensitive to layer pruning than classification benchmarks, with even single-layer removal causing severe degradation, underscoring the depth dependence of such tasks. We provide systematic analysis of pruning-induced failure modes in generative settings. Beyond surfacelevel text degradation, we show that pruning disrupts core algorithmic abilities such as arithmetic computation and valid syntactic generation, which directly impairs multi-step reasoning. Under realistic post-training constraints, we propose supervised finetuning with Self-Generated Responses (SGR) as simple recovery strategy. We show that this SGR finetuning consistently outperforms finetuning on external open-source datasets, achieving strong retention on classification tasks and also on generative benchmarks at moderate pruning ratios. Finally, we show that even the strongest recovery achieved under these constraints fails to fully restore arithmetic and syntactic capabilities. This exposes fundamental limitation of post-pruning recovery for generative reasoning and suggests that, despite ap"

To further enhance the practical utility of LLMs, existing research has primarily focused on incorporating external tools to transcend their inherent limitations. Traditional tool-augmented approaches [13, 26] typically rely on predefined workflows to orchestrate tool invocation. However, such rigid paradigms struggle to generalize to open and uncertain environments. While multi-agent systems [34, 25, 15, 14] enhance flexibility by employing central model for Co-first author Technique Leader Supervisor Preprint. Figure 1: Comparison of tool-creating agents. (a) For this specific math problem, the standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [33, 12] method fails and makes errors even during simple calculations. (b) Previous tool creation methods typically solve problems by generating code specific to the current instance. However, these tools are tailored solely to the immediate problem, making them nonreusable for other tasks and still prone to errors. (c) Ours. We propose framework capable of reusing tool creation experience. During the inference process for task solving, UCT can utilize, create, and self-evolve existing tools. Furthermore, we design an offline memory consolidation module to generalize tool memory and transform it into reusable tool experience assets. planning and delegating sub-tasks to tool-using sub-agents, the deployment of multiple models incurs additional computational costs and introduces interaction latency. With the advancement of thought augmented models [33, 10], Tool Integrated Reasoning (TIR) methods [21, 4] exemplified by the ReAct [37] paradigm have emerged. The core philosophy of TIR involves enabling the model to explicitly generate reasoning traces during the inference process, autonomously invoke tools, and make iterative decisions based on feedback from the external environment. Consequently, TIR agents are capable of dynamically planning multi-step operations, which solves more end-to-end problems in open-world tasks. However, tools employed in existing TIR or tool-using frameworks typically manifest in two forms. The first relies on manual definition, which entails laborious tool construction efforts. Moreover, such hand-crafted tools inevitably fail to cover the exhaustive range of problem-solving requirements during reasoning [19, 22]. The second approach involves generating ad-hoc code to address the immediate problem [8, 5]. However, these methods introduce significant uncertainty, as the generated code may be erroneous, and even when valid tool is produced, the lack of persistence mechanisms restricts the agent to single-use scenarios. Although tool creation has emerged in agent research that allows for the creation of autonomous tools during reasoning [20, 38, 30], these methods are inherently limited. Figure 1 compares existing tool-creating agents. They tend to construct tools bespoke to specific tasks, rendering them single-use. This prevents the agent from internalizing these resource-intensive creations into reusable library of experiential assets. To overcome the shortcomings of current agents, we introduce self-evolving tool construction paradigm. Mimicking human problem-solving, our agent autonomously explores potential strategies when confronting complex tasks and encapsulates these experiences into persistent tools. By consolidating recurring sub-capabilities into reusable library, the agent ensures their availability for future instances. This dynamic mechanism fosters continuous evolution during reasoning, effectively breaking through the rigid boundaries of existing frameworks. In this paper, we propose self-evolving agent that transforms from tool User to Creator via Training-Free experience reuse (UCT). This framework enables the flexible and autonomous creation and execution of tools on demand, allowing the agent to absorb experience from reasoning and evolve accordingly. Built upon the ReAct paradigm, our architecture consists of three distinct modules: the Online Task Loop, the Online Build Loop, and Offline Memory Consolidation. The online task loop focuses on online problem-solving and triggers the online build loop whenever the agent requests tool that does not yet exist. To ensure system stability, the tool creation process is constrained and incorporates rigorous testing and review mechanisms to guarantee t"

Text:"Mano: Restriking Manifold Optimization for LLM Training Yufei Gu 1 Zeke Xie 1 6 2 0 2 0 3 ] . [ 1 0 0 0 3 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r aWhile large language models (LLMs) have emerged as significant advancement in artificial intelligence, the hardware and computational costs for training LLMs are also significantly burdensome. Among the state-of-the-art optimizers, AdamW relies on diagonal curvature estimates and ignores structural properties, while Muon applies global spectral normalization at the expense of losing curvature information. In this study, we restriked manifold optimization methods for training LLMs, which may address both optimizers limitations, while conventional manifold optimization methods have been largely overlooked due to the poor performance in large-scale model optimization. By innovatively projecting the momentum onto the tangent space of model parameters and constraining it on rotational Oblique manifold, we propose novel, powerful, and efficient optimizer Mano that is the first to bridge the performance gap between manifold optimization and modern optimizers. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen3 models demonstrate that Mano consistently and significantly outperforms AdamW and Muon even with less memory consumption and computational complexity, respectively, suggesting an expanded Pareto frontier in terms of space and time efficiency. 1. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) are represented as major milestone in artificial intelligence and computing technology (Kumar, 2024; Gao et al., 2025). Nevertheless, training LLMs with billions of parameters requires specialized hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and NPUs, which consumes sunstantial energy and result in enormous computational costs (Samsi et al., 2023; Chowdhury et al., 2025). 1xLeaF Lab, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology to: Yufei Gu <ygu167@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn>, Zeke Xie <zekexie@hkust-gz.edu.cn>. Correspondence (Guangzhou). Preprint. February 2, 2026. 1 Consequently, advanced optimization methods are critical for reducing the training costs of LLMs. Adam is widely regarded as one of the most popular optimizers in deep learning, with its variants being extensively used to train deep neural networks (DNNs) across wide range of tasks (Kingma, 2014). In particular, AdamW, which decouples weight decay from the original gradient update of Adam, has been the dominant optimizer in training LLMs with broad infrastructure support for large-scale distributed training (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017; Kunstner et al., 2024). However, by relying on the diagonal estimates of per-parameter curvature, Adam-based optimizers ignore spectral information and fail to capture the subspace structures of the parameter matrix. To address this limitation, Muon introduces the Newton-Schulz iteration to approximate matrix orthogonalization, allowing uniform exploration across all spectral directions in the loss landscape (Jordan et al., 2024). However, this spectral normalization strategy eliminates the curvature information encoded in the gradient and momentum, which may lead to sub-optimal performance on certain occasions (Su, 2025). For optimization problems with so-called manifold structure, algorithms have been developed to exploit this special structure from the perspective of differential geometry and numerical analysis, referred to as manifold optimization methods (Absil et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2020; Fei et al., 2025). However, these traditional manifold optimization methods have been overlooked for LLMs. In this study, we seek to adapt and extend manifold optimization methods to LLM training, where the underlying manifold structure of natural language or optimal parameters is not explicitly known or well understood, relaxing the constraints and assumptions typically required. Instead of retracting and constraining the parameters onto some manifolds surfaces, we demonstrate that by only projecting the momentum onto the tangent vector spaces of the parameters and mapping it to the Oblique manifold, the constrained gradient steps emerged as simple yet effective learning direction in the solution space with strong escape-from-local-minima properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate the empirical advantages of periodically rotating the Oblique manifold, process equivalent to an alternating column-row normalization scheme applied at each optimization step. Mano: Restriking Manifold Optimization for LLM Training (Zhao et al., 2024b). Its popularity stems from its simplified design, flexibility in per-parameter adaptive learning rate, and robustness in performance across diverse domains. However, the firstand second-moment estimates of AdamW consume double the memory footprint of model weights or gradients, resulting in significant memory overhead, especially for LLMs at scale. Several approaches have emerged to design more memory-efficient optimizers. Adam-mini leverages block-wise learning rate schedules based on Hessian partitions (Zhang et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2025); Lion uses momentum-sign updates to eliminate the need of second moment (Chen et al., 2023), and Cautious-Adam/Lion applies gradient-aligned selective updates (Liang et al., 2024); SOAP instead applies AdamW updates in the Shampoo eigenbasis while amortizing eigendecomposition costs across multiple steps (Gupta et al., 2018; Vyas et al., 2024). Other notable methods include SWAN (Ma et al., 2024), MARS (Yuan et al., 2024), Sophia (Liu et al., 2023), and etc. Another particularly promising line of research focuses on matrix-based spectral preconditioning methods. Muon, introduced by Jordan et al. (2024) in 2023, utilized the Newton-Schulz iteration to perform spectral normalization on the update steps. This approximation to the matrix-sign function produces semi-orthogonal momentum update that normalized the magnitude at all spectral directions, including those low-magnitude but important directions for model generalization. Empirical studies have later extended Muon to scaled-up LLM training with stability, and demonstrated improved efficiency with halved memory consumption in comparison to AdamW (Liu et al., 2025; Shah et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2025). Benchmarking studies also demonstrate that matrix-based optimizers with spectral preconditioning (e.g., Kron, Muon, SOAP) often outperform scalar-based counterparts (e.g., AdamW, Lion, MARS), though no optimizer significantly outperforms in every tested scenario (Schlott"

Text:"On the Relationship Between Representation Geometry and Generalization in Deep Neural Networks Sumit Yadav 1 1Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University, Nepal 076bct088.sumit@pcampus.edu.np Abstract. Understanding the factors that determine neural network generalization remains fundamental challenge in deep learning theory. We investigate the relationship between the geometry of learned represen tations and model performance through systematic empirical studies spanning vision and language domains. Analyzing 52 pretrained ImageNet classifiers across 13 architecture families, we demonstrate that effective dimensionan unsupervised geometric metric requiring no labelsstrongly predicts classification accuracy. Output effective dimension shows the strongest partial correlation with accuracy (partial 𝑟 = 0.75, 𝑝 < 1010) after controlling for model capacity, while total compressionthe logratio of output to input effective dimensionalityachieves 𝑟 = 0.65 (partial 𝑟 = 0.72). These dual geometric signatures form complemen tary framework: output effective dimension captures representation richness while compression captures information refinement. Our findings replicate across indistribution (ImageNet) and transfer (CIFAR10) settings. We demonstrate crossdomain generalization: effective dimension metrics predict performance for 8 encoder models on NLP tasks (SST2, MNLI) and 15 decoderonly LLMs (GPT2, OPT, Qwen, SmolLM, Phi) on AG News, where compression correlates with representation quality (𝑟 = 0.69, 𝑝 = 0.004) while model size does not (𝑟 = 0.07). We establish bidirectional causality through controlled intervention: degrading geometry via noise injection causes accuracy loss (𝑟 = 0.94, 𝑝 < 109), while improving geometry via PCA projection maintains accuracy across multiple architectures (mean 0.03pp loss at 95% variance across ResNet18, ResNet34, DenseNet121). Critically, this relationship is noise-type agnostic: Gaussian (𝑟 = 0.94), Uniform (𝑟 = 0.96)"

Text:"AI-Generated Image Detectors Overrely on Global Artifacts: Evidence from Inpainting Exchange Elif Nebioglu * 1 Emirhan Bilgic * 2 3 Adrian PopescuModern deep learning-based inpainting enables realistic local image manipulation, raising critical challenges for reliable detection. However, we observe that current detectors primarily rely on global artifacts that appear as inpainting side effects, rather than on locally synthesized content. We show that this behavior occurs because VAE-based reconstruction induces subtle but pervasive spectral shift across the entire image, including unedited regions. To isolate this effect, we introduce Inpainting Exchange (INP-X), an operation that restores original pixels outside the edited region while preserving all synthesized content. We create 90K test dataset including real, inpainted, and exchanged images to evaluate this phenomenon. Under this intervention, pretrained state-of-the-art detectors, including commercial ones, exhibit dramatic drop in accuracy (e.g., from 91% to 55%), frequently approaching chance level. We provide theoretical analysis linking this behavior to high-frequency attenuation caused by VAE information bottlenecks. Our findings highlight the need for content-aware detection. Indeed, training on our dataset yields better generalization and localization than standard inpainting. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https: //github.com/emirhanbilgic/INP-X. 6 2 0 2 0 3 ] . [ 1 2 9 1 0 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r 1. Introduction Inpainting, the task of filling masked regions with plausible content, has become mainstream image editing capability through diffusion-based tools (Rombach et al., 2022; Podell et al., 2024) and commercial services (DeepImage, 2026). *Equal contribution 1Independent Researcher 2Universite Sorbonne, Pierre et Marie Curie, ISIR 3Institut Polytechnique de Paris, U2IS 4Universite Paris-Saclay, CEA, LIST. Correspondence to: Elif Nebioglu <elifnebiogllu@gmail.com>, Emirhan Bilgic <emirhan.bilgic@ip-paris.fr>. Preprint. February 3, 2026. This accessibility poses significant risks for misinformation and content authenticity (Verdoliva, 2020), making reliable detection of inpainted content critical. Both academic methods (Ojha et al., 2023; Corvi et al., 2023) and commercial APIs (SightEngine, 2026; Hive Moderation, 2026) report high detection accuracy (>90%) on benchmark datasets. However, fundamental question remains: what are these detectors actually learning? For inpainting, which synthesizes only local region, we would expect detectors to focus on the generated content within the edited region. Instead, we show that many state-of-the-art detectors rely primarily on global artifacts introduced by the image generation pipeline, exploiting form of shortcut learning (Geirhos et al., 2020) that undermines their intended purpose. This behavior occurs because diffusion-based inpainting processes the entire image through VAE encoder-decoder, leading to subtle yet widespread spectral shift across the image. This global fingerprint provides trivial detection signal that bypasses the need to identify locally generated content and calls into question the robustness of AI-generated image detectors. We address this problem with the following contributions: We introduce INP-X, illustrated in Figure 1, that surgically restores original pixels outside the edited region while preserving the generated content within the mask. If detectors truly identify synthetic content, they should spot it in exchanged images since the fake content remains intact. We provide theoretical analysis and experimental validation linking the observed spectral shift to high-frequency attenuation caused by VAE information bottleneck constraints (Theorem 3.2), and show that our exchange operation minimizes distributional divergence by eliminating background artifacts (Theorem 3.4). We construct 90K-image benchmark extending SemiTruths across 4 datasets and 3 inpainting models, with matched real/standard/exchanged triplets. We evaluate 11 pretrained detectors and 2 commercial APIs, demonstrating consistent and severe performance degradation under our attack. Notably, commercial systems (HiveModeration, Sightengine) drop from >91% to 55% accuracy, approaching random chance. AI-Generated Image Detectors Overrely on Global Artifacts: Evidence from Inpainting Exchange 2025b), which leverages spectral distributions as invariant patterns, and Artifact Purification Networks (Meng et al., 2024), which separate artifact features from semantic content via frequency-band proposals. Universal Detectors and Generalization. The quest for detectors that generalize across generators has yielded several influential approaches. (Ojha et al., 2023) proposes learning generator-agnostic representations in CLIPs feature space, achieving strong cross-generator performance. Similarly, (Cozzolino et al., 2024a;b) leverage CLIP embeddings with lightweight classifiers, demonstrating impressive generalization and zero-shot capabilities. However, recent studies question whether CLIP-based detectors rely on artifact cues or semantic shortcuts. (Chu et al., 2025) shows that patch shuffling forces models toward artifact-oriented representations, while (Yan et al., 2025a) introduces NULLspace projection to decouple semantic information from forgery-relevant features. Shortcut Learning and Dataset Biases. Despite reported successes, mounting evidence suggests that detector performance may originate in dataset biases rather than genuine detection capabilities. (Rajan & Lee, 2025) argue that detectors largely ignore real-image features, instead relying on easy-to-learn shortcuts in fake images. (Ha et al., 2024) shows that detectors struggle when generators improve sufficiently. (Yan et al., 2025b) provides rigorous sanity check, revealing that many reported gains stem from dataset biases. (Grommelt et al., 2024) exposes systematic biases related to JPEG compression and resolution. (Guillaro et al., 2025) introduce bias-free training paradigm, while (Li et al., 2024) highlight persistent vulnerabilities. Our work provides controlled intervention that demonstrates the phenomenon in the inpainting setting. Manipulation, Localization, and Forensic Analysis.

Text:"ParalESN: Enabling parallel information processing in Reservoir Computing Matteo Pinna * 1 Giacomo Lagomarsini * 1 Andrea Ceni 1 Claudio Gallicchio 1 Abstract Reservoir Computing (RC) has established itself as an efficient paradigm for temporal processing. However, its scalability remains severely constrained by (i) the necessity of processing temporal data sequentially and (ii) the prohibitive memory footprint of high-dimensional reservoirs. In this work, we revisit RC through the lens of structured operators and state space modeling to address these limitations, introducing Parallel Echo State Network (ParalESN). ParalESN enables the construction of high-dimensional and efficient reservoirs based on diagonal linear recurrence in the complex space, enabling parallel processing of temporal data. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that ParalESN preserves the Echo State Property and the universality guarantees of traditional Echo State Networks while admitting an equivalent representation of arbitrary linear reservoirs in the complex diagonal form. Empirically, ParalESN matches the predictive accuracy of traditional RC on time series benchmarks, while delivering substantial computational savings. On 1-D pixel-level classification tasks, ParalESN achieves competitive accuracy with fully trainable neural networks while reducing computational costs and energy consumption by orders of magnitude. Overall, ParalESN offers promising, scalable, and principled pathway for integrating RC within the deep learning landscape. 6 2 0 2 9 ] . [ 1 6 9 2 2 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r 1.

We introduce On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), memory-efficient framework that replaces token-level probability matching with trajectory matching using discrete verbal scores (09) from teacher models. OVD dramatically reduces memory consumption while enabling on-policy distillation from teacher models with verbal feedback, and avoids token-level alignment, allowing the student model to freely explore the output space. Extensive experiments on Web question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks show that OVD substantially outperforms existing methods, delivering up to +12.9% absolute improvement in average EM on Web Q&A tasks and up to +25.7% gain on math benchmarks (when trained with only one random samples), while also exhibiting superior training efficiency. Our project page is available at https://OVD.github.io. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their ability to perform complex multi-step reasoning remains fundamental challenge (Wei et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2025a). While recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable models to develop long-horizon reasoning behaviors (Shao et al., 1The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China 2Nanjing University, Nanjing, China 3Huawei Technologies, China. Correspondence to: Jing Xiong <junexiong@connect.hku.hk>. Preprint. January 30, 2026. 2024; Singh et al., 2023), the high computational costs and resource requirements of training large reasoning models create significant barrier to widespread deployment. Knowledge distillation offers promising solution by transferring reasoning capabilities from powerful teacher models to more efficient student models (Hinton et al., 2015; Hsieh et al., 2023). However, existing distillation approaches face limitations when applied to RL, particularly in terms of memory efficiency and the ability to leverage verbal feedback (Shinn et al., 2023). The traditional knowledge distillation methods for LLMs operate at the token level, requiring the teacher model to output probability distributions over the entire vocabulary at each decoding step (Kim & Rush, 2016; Gu et al., 2023). While this fine-grained supervision provides rich gradient signals, it introduces severe memory bottleneck for RL. For example, with batch size = 8, = 4 samples per problem, sequence length = 8192, and vocabulary size = 152K, storing the Qwen-7B models logits in FP32 consumes around 160 GB of memory per batch, far exceeding modern accelerators capacity. This memory cost scales linearly with trajectory length, making token-level distillation impractical for long-horizon reasoning chains in complex problems. Additionally, token-level distillation fail to capture the hierarchical structure of reasoning, and strictly matching the student and teacher distributions constrains the models exploration. More broadly, the potential of distillation methods that incorporate verbal feedback from environment agents remains underexplored. Recent studies show that training language models with environment agents can substantially enhance models search capabilities (Jin et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2025; Fang et al., 2025). However, the verification capabilities of environment agents, particularly in the context of on-policy distillation (Agarwal et al., 2024), have not been sufficiently studied. This limitation prevents distillation methods from fully leveraging the rich supervision provided by verifiable agents, especially in information retrieval domain. To address these challenges, we introduce On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), which reformulates distillation as trajectory matching rather than token-level probability matching, OVD: On-policy Verbal Distillation enabling principled integration of verbal feedback into onpolicy distillation. In OVD, teacher agents provide verbal scores on reasoning correctness to evaluate trajectories, allowing the student model to learn both reasoning patterns and interaction behaviors through RL. By replacing fullvocabulary logit supervision with verbal trajectory evaluation, OVD significantly reduces the memory overhead of distillation. Our main contributions are: We propose On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), an on-policy reinforcement learning distillation framework that supervises student trajectories using discrete verbal feedback from teacher models instead of tokenlevel probability matching. This design greatly reduces memory cost and promotes on-policy exploration. We conduct extensive experiments on Web Q&A and mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that OVD substantially outperforms existing RL-based web search methods while exhibiting superior sample efficiency. By scaling trajectory sampling on single randomly selected instance, we achieve an 25.7% performance improvement on math benchmarks. We provide theoretical analysis of OVD, showing that its rejection sampling scheme yields unbiased gradient estimates, and demonstrate that an interactive environment agent is key to success on Web Q&A tasks. 2. Why Verbal Distillation? In this section, we explain why OVD adopts verbal scoring over token-level distillation for improved memory efficiency. Memory Bottleneck. Token-level distillation suffers from three fundamental limitations: (i) it treats all tokens equally, ignoring the hierarchical structure of reasoning; (ii) it requires access to the teachers token-level probability distribution, which may be unavailable for black-box models; and (iii) When distillation relies on large-scale rollouts from reasoning model, token-level supervision incurs prohibitive memory overhead, as it requires storing logits over the entire vocabulary for each token in trajectories of length L.

Text:"Meet Doshi 1 Vishwajeet Kumar 1 Yulong Li 1 Jaydeep SenGeneral-purpose open-domain dense retrieval systems are usually trained with large, eclectic mix of corpora and search tasks. How should these diverse corpora and tasks be sampled for training? Conventional approaches sample them uniformly, proportional to their instance population sizes, or depend on human-level expert supervision. It is well known that the training data sampling strategy can greatly impact model performance. However, how to find the optimal strategy has not been adequately studied in the context of embedding models. We propose Inf-DDS, novel reinforcement learningdriven sampling framework that adaptively reweighs training datasets guided by influence-based reward signals and is much more lightweight w.r.t.

Introduction Text-to-embedding based dense retriever models have recently gained huge popularity with their strong results across various benchmarks (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; BehnamGhader et al., 2024).

For instance, the Sentence-Transformers project, which develops generic sentence embeddings, utilized billions of instances across multiple datasets, with domain-specific data varying widely in size. However, larger datasets dont inherently improve embedding quality, making it crucial to identify the most informative datasets and their optimal proportions for training. Effective sampling strategies are essential to prevent overfitting or underfitting, making dataset selection central challenge in developing robust, generalizable, or domainspecific embedding models. While random sampling is common default, it is limited by ignoring data source informativeness when sampling from large training datasets. Alternatives include temperature sampling and instance-based proportional sampling. more intensive approach involves creating ad-hoc sampling distributions via iterative experimentation, termed expert weights, requiring expert evaluation. However, these strategies are static and predefined, often suboptimal compared to the unknown ideal distribution for maximizing model performance. dynamic sampling approach, capable of adaptation, may better approximate this optimal distribution. There has consequently been substantial interest in mak1 Influence Guided Sampling for Domain Adaptation of Text Retrievers ing sampling adaptive. Gradient-based approaches such as DDS (Wang et al., 2020a) and its multi-target extension (Wang et al., 2020b) use gradient-derived rewards to adjust the training distribution online. DoGE (Fan et al., 2024) proposes generalization estimation function to approximate data influence, while methods like DoReMi (Xie et al., 2023a; Engstrom et al., 2024) rely on proxy models to estimate dataset utility. In practice, these dynamic methods face two main challenges: (1) instability and high variance introduced by stochastic gradients, which we empirically demonstrate in Section 5, and (2) substantial computational overhead when proxy models or expensive estimators are required. Together, these limitations motivate the design of an online, adaptive optimization strategy that can learn sampling weights efficiently and robustly while remaining computationally tractable. In this paper, we propose Influence-guided Dynamic Data Sampling strategy (Inf-DDS), computationally efficient novel algorithm that addresses the critical challenge of data sampling for domain adaptation, overcoming limitations of existing gradient-based methods. Inf-DDS iteratively takes small gradient-update steps on each domains data, monitoring the impact on the downstream metric. Domains demonstrating greater performance improvements are subsequently assigned higher rewards. This adaptive sampling strategy, inspired by recent influence-based methods (Koh & Liang, 2017; Bae et al., 2022; Fan et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024; Xia et al., 2024) for sampling training data across multiple domains, focuses learning on the most informative subsets of data. Our algorithm offers three key advantages over prior work: (1) it eliminates the dependence on noisy gradient estimates for reward computation, (2) it efficiently reuses computations from updating the parameterized sampling distribution ψ parameters to also update the model parameters θ, making it much more computationally efficient and (3) it produces more reliable and interpretable sampling trajectories for better downstream gains. Our contributions in this work are as follows: a. We propose Inf-DDS, an influence-guided reinforcement learning approach that learns to adjust sampling probabilities across diverse training datasets, improving targetdomain retrieval performance while being much more computationally efficient. b. We validate Inf-DDS against robust benchmarks, including BEIR datasets (Thakur et al., 2021), SentenceTransformers all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019) and MLDR (Chen et al., 2024), demonstrating significant improvements while optimizing for target domain. 2.

We introduce internal flow signatures that audit decision formation from depthwise dynamics at fixed inter-block monitoring boundary. The method stabilizes token-wise motion via biascentered monitoring, then summarizes trajectories in compact moving readout-aligned subspaces constructed from the top token and its close competitors within each depth window. Neighboring window frames are aligned by an orthogonal transport, yielding depth-comparable transported step lengths, turning angles, and subspace drift summaries that are invariant to within-window basis choices. lightweight GRU validator trained on these signatures performs self-checking without modifying the base model. Beyond detection, the validator localizes culprit depth event and enables targeted refinement: the model rolls back to the culprit token and clamps an abnormal transported step at the identified block while preserving the orthogonal residual. The resulting pipeline provides actionable localization and low-overhead self-checking from internal decision dynamics. Code is available on GitHub. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent answers that are locally consistent yet globally incorrect (Huang et al., 2023; Maynez et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023). In practical deployments, user typically needs to know not only whether an answer is wrong, but also whether the model was internally confident for the right reasons (Geng et al., 2024). Current safeguards lean on external verification, retrieval, or an additional LLM judge 1Department of Computer Science, University of CalSungheon Jeong Correspondence to: Irvine. ifornia, <sungheoj@uci.edu>. Preprint. February 2, 2026. 1 (Nakano et al., 2021; Lewis et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2023). These approaches add latency and cost, and they react only after the full generation is produced, while the internal process that formed the decision remains largely unobserved (Gao et al., 2023; Kossen et al., 2024; Farquhar et al., 2024). We take different view of inference. Rather than treating an autoregressive transformer as single input-to-output mapping, we interpret generation as depthwise flow of internal states and intermediate readouts (Belrose et al., 2023; Ferrando et al., 2023; Pal et al., 2023). key lens is how logit competition evolves across depth (Belrose et al., 2023; Chuang et al., 2023): as token decision forms, the top token and its close competitors shift in structured ways (Ferrando et al., 2023; Pal et al., 2023). This yields measurable trace of decision formation that supports internal audits and lightweight self-checking (Elhage et al., 2021; Azaria & Mitchell, 2023; Chen et al., 2024a; Ji et al., 2024; Sriramanan et al., 2024). Unlike Logit lens (Elhage et al., 2021), which inspects what layer encodes, we track how the decision trajectory is shaped across depth, enabling localization of atypical motion to specific internal updates. Turning this intuition into reliable measurements faces two obstacles. First, any fixed global coordinate system can be misleading, since readout-relevant directions and what is linearly decodable can shift with depth (Belrose et al., 2023; Tenney et al., 2019; Ethayarajh, 2019). Second, the monitored boundary typically includes normalization with learned gain and bias, and its placement affects depthwise behavior, introducing depth dependent offsets that can contaminate token-wise motion and complicate depth aggregation (Ba et al., 2016; Xiong et al., 2020). Without resolving these issues, depthwise signatures become unstable and difficult to compare across layers, prompts, or models. This can prevent module level attribution of where the trajectory gets steered off course during generation. We address these obstacles by stabilizing depthwise measurements in local moving frame. We monitor the residual stream at fixed boundary and remove depth dependent token shared offsets, so token motion reflects decision dynamics rather than layer specific shifts. Within each depth window, we build compact readout aligned frame from the top token and close competitors, then align neighboring frames orthogonally so step size, turning, and drift remain Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2026 comparable across depth. These signatures enable self checking by training lightweight validator on geometric flow patterns in depthwise decision formation. From flow features extracted during generation, the validator separates reliable and unreliable regimes by detecting atypical transported step length, turning, and subspace drift in moving readout aligned frame, without modifying the base LLM. Across tasks and models, this supervision is stable and learnable, yielding consistent separation between non hallucination and hallucination like behaviors with minimal overhead. Beyond detection, the same signal localizes single depth localized culprit event. We roll back to the token position where it occurs and regenerate while intervening at only one transformer block. The intervention clamps an abnormally large transported step in the readout aligned low dimensional frame while preserving the orthogonal residual component, producing targeted refinement that reduces hallucination without retraining or modifying the base model. 2. Related Work Hallucination detection and self-checking in LLMs. Prior work mitigates hallucination and factual errors by adding external verification, including retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al., 2020; Nakano et al., 2021), post-hoc checking with an additional language model (Zheng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023), and faithfulness benchmarks (Maynez et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2022). While effective, these approaches act only after generation, add latency and cost, and treat the base model as black box, offering limited access to the internal decision process that produced the output. Logit-based probing and intermediate readouts. Recent work probes transformer representations via intermediate readouts. Logit Lens (Elhage et al., 2021) and refinements such as Tuned Lens (Belrose et al., 2023) decode logits from hidden states across depth to study "

Text:"INDIBATOR: Diverse and Fact-Grounded Individuality for Multi-Agent Debate in Molecular Discovery Yunhui Jang 1 Seonghyun Park 1 Jaehyung Kim 2 Sungsoo Ahn 1 6 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 5 1 8 1 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract Multi-agent systems have emerged as powerful paradigm for automating scientific discovery. To differentiate agent behavior in the multiagent system, current frameworks typically assign generic role-based personas such as reviewer or writer or rely on coarse grained keyword-based personas. While functional, this approach oversimplifies how human scientists operate, whose contributions are shaped by their unique research trajectories. In response, we propose INDIBATOR, framework for molecular discovery that grounds agents in individualized scientist profiles constructed from two modalities: publication history for literature-derived knowledge and molecular history for structural priors. These agents engage in multi-turn debate through proposal, critique, and voting phases. Our evaluation demonstrates that these fine-grained individuality-grounded agents consistently outperform systems relying on coarse-grained personas, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art performance. These results validate that capturing the scientific DNA of individual agents is essential for high-quality discovery. 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across wide variety of tasks (Singh et al., 2025; Anthropic, 2024; Team et al., 2025; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). Beyond direct prompting, recent works have introduced AI agents capable of planning and executing actions over multiple iterations (Yao et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023; M. Bran et al., 2024). While impressive, singleagent systems often encounter constraints such as bounded context windows and limited perspective diversity. To address this, multi-agent systems have emerged as powerful 1Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), South Korea 2Yonsei university, South"

Text:"6 2 0 2 1 3 ] . [ 1 1 2 5 0 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Diagnosing the Reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge via Item Response Theory Junhyuk Choi 1 * Sohhyung Park 2 * Chanhee Cho 1 Hyeonchu Park 1 Bugeun Kim 1 Abstract While LLM-as-a-Judge is widely used in automated evaluation, existing validation practices primarily operate at the level of observed outputs, offering limited insight into whether LLM judges themselves function as stable and reliable measurement instruments. To address this limitation, we introduce two-phase diagnostic framework for assessing reliability of LLM-as-aJudge, grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT). The framework adopts Graded Response Model (GRM) of IRT and formalizes reliability along two complementary dimensions: (1) intrinsic consistency, defined as the stability of measurement behavior under prompt variations, and (2) human alignment, capturing correspondence with human quality assessments. We empirically examine diverse LLM judges with this framework, and show that leveraging IRT-GRM yields interpretable signals for diagnosing judgments systematically. These signals provide practical guidance for verifying reliablity of LLM-as-a-Judge and identifying potential causes of unreliability 1. 1. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as automated evaluators across diverse domains, commonly referred to as LLM-as-a-Judge (Liu et al., 2023; Gu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024). This paradigm has been rapidly adopted not only in natural language processing tasks such as summarization (Fabbri et al., 2021; Crupi et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2023) and dialogue evaluation (Mehri & Eskenazi, 2020; Chan et al., 2024), but also extends to visionlanguage models (Ku et al., 2024a; Chen et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024), and reward modeling for reinforcement learning from human feedback (Wang et al., 2024c; Xu et al., *Equal contribution 1Department of Artificial Intelligence, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea 2Department of Industrial Engineering,"

Text:"Clipping-Free Policy Optimization for Large Language Models Omer Veysel agatan 1 Barıs Akg un 1 2 Gozde ul ahin 1 2 Xuandong Zhao 3 6 2 0 2 0 3 ] . [ 1 1 0 8 2 2 . 1 0 6 2 : r Abstract Reinforcement learning has become central to post-training large language models, yet dominant algorithms rely on clipping mechanisms that introduce optimization issues at scale, including zero-gradient regions, reward hacking, and training instability. We propose Clipping-Free Policy Optimization (CFPO), which replaces heuristic clipping with convex quadratic penalty derived from Total Variation divergence constraints, yielding an everywhere-differentiable objective that enforces stable policy updates without hard boundaries. We evaluate CFPO across both reasoning and alignment settings. In reasoning, CFPO matches clipping-based methods on downstream benchmarks while extending the stable training regime. In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance. CFPO requires only one-line code change and no additional hyperparameters. Our results suggest that CFPO is promising drop-in alternative to clipping-based methods for LLM post-training. 1. Introduction Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central component of large language model (LLM) post-training. Early work demonstrated that RL from human feedback (RLHF) could align models with human preferences and instructions (Christiano et al., 2023; Stiennon et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022), and more recent efforts have shown that RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit complex reasoning behaviors (DeepSeek-AI, 2025; OpenAI, 2024b; Google DeepMind, 2025). These successes have established RL as an essential stage in modern LLM training pipelines. 1KUIS AI Center, Koc University, Istanbul, Turkiye Istanbul, Turkiye 3University of Califor2Koc University, Omer Veysel nia, Berkeley, CA, USA.

We couple a scalable data-processing pipeline (3,000 hours of demonstrations) with temporal alignment and quality filtering, and use a unified, embodiment-aware action interface enabling a single policy to control humanoids, mobile manipulators, and fixed-base arms. At inference, the VLA controller is enhanced with episode-progress prediction, out-of-distribution detection, and joint-prediction-based guidance to improve safety and precise target selection. Experiments on Simpler BRIDGE WidowX and CALVIN ABC-D, as well as real-robot evaluations, show strong generalization and performance gains from RL alignment in success rate, robustness, and long-horizon efficiency.

Kimi K2.5 is an open-source multimodal agentic model that enhances text and vision processing through joint optimization techniques and introduces Agent Swarm for parallel task execution.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Kimi K2.5, an open-source multimodal agentic model designed to advance general agentic intelligence. K2.5 emphasizes the joint optimization of text and vision so that two modalities enhance each other. This includes a series of techniques such as joint text-vision pre-training, zero-vision SFT, and joint text-vision reinforcement learning. Building on this multimodal foundation, K2.5 introduces Agent Swarm, a self-directed parallel agent orchestration framework that dynamically decomposes complex tasks into heterogeneous sub-problems and executes them concurrently. Extensive evaluations show that Kimi K2.5 achieves state-of-the-art results across various domains including coding, vision, reasoning, and agentic tasks. Agent Swarm also reduces latency by up to 4.5times over single-agent baselines. We release the post-trained Kimi K2.5 model checkpoint to facilitate future research and real-world applications of agentic intelligence.

Vision-DeepResearch introduces a multimodal deep-research paradigm enabling multi-turn, multi-entity, and multi-scale visual and textual search with deep-research capabilities integrated through cold-start supervision and reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a broad range of vision tasks. However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM.

Vision-DeepResearch benchmark addresses limitations in evaluating visual-textual search capabilities of multimodal models by introducing realistic evaluation conditions and improving visual retrieval through multi-round cropped-search workflow.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced VQA and now support Vision-DeepResearch systems that use search engines for complex visual-textual fact-finding. However, evaluating these visual and textual search abilities is still difficult, and existing benchmarks have two major limitations. First, existing benchmarks are not visual search-centric: answers that should require visual search are often leaked through cross-textual cues in the text questions or can be inferred from the prior world knowledge in current MLLMs. Second, overly idealized evaluation scenario: On the image-search side, the required information can often be obtained via near-exact matching against the full image, while the text-search side is overly direct and insufficiently challenging. To address these issues, we construct the Vision-DeepResearch benchmark (VDR-Bench) comprising 2,000 VQA instances. All questions are created via a careful, multi-stage curation pipeline and rigorous expert review, designed to assess the behavior of Vision-DeepResearch systems under realistic real-world conditions. Moreover, to address the insufficient visual retrieval capabilities of current MLLMs, we propose a simple multi-round cropped-search workflow. This strategy is shown to effectively improve model performance in realistic visual retrieval scenarios. Overall, our results provide practical guidance for the design of future multimodal deep-research systems. The code will be released in https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-DeepResearch.

RPG-Encoder framework transforms repository comprehension and generation into a unified cycle by encoding code into high-fidelity Repository Planning Graph representations that improve understanding and reconstruction accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current repository agents encounter a reasoning disconnect due to fragmented representations, as existing methods rely on isolated API documentation or dependency graphs that lack semantic depth. We consider repository comprehension and generation to be inverse processes within a unified cycle: generation expands intent into implementation, while comprehension compresses implementation back into intent. To address this, we propose RPG-Encoder, a framework that generalizes the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) from a static generative blueprint into a unified, high-fidelity representation. RPG-Encoder closes the reasoning loop through three mechanisms: (1) Encoding raw code into the RPG that combines lifted semantic features with code dependencies; (2) Evolving the topology incrementally to decouple maintenance costs from repository scale, reducing overhead by 95.7%; and (3) Operating as a unified interface for structure-aware navigation. In evaluations, RPG-Encoder establishes state-of-the-art repository understanding on SWE-bench Verified with 93.7% Acc@5 and exceeds the best baseline by over 10% on SWE-bench Live Lite. These results highlight our superior fine-grained localization accuracy in complex codebases. Furthermore, it achieves 98.5% reconstruction coverage on RepoCraft, confirming RPG's high-fidelity capacity to mirror the original codebase and closing the loop between intent and implementation.

"RPG-Encoder framework transforms repository comprehension and generation into a unified cycle by encoding code into high-fidelity Repository Planning Graph representations that improve understanding and reconstruction accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current repository agents encounter a reasoning disconnect due to fragmented representations, as existing methods rely on isolated API documentation or dependency graphs that lack semantic depth. We consider repository comprehension and generation to be inverse processes within a unified cycle: generation expands intent into implementation, while comprehension compresses implementation back into intent. To address this, we propose RPG-Encoder, a framework that generalizes the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) from a static generative blueprint into a unified, high-fidelity representation. RPG-Encoder closes the reasoning loop through three mechanisms: (1) Encoding raw code into the RPG that combines lifted semantic features with code dependencies; (2) Evolving the topology incrementally to decouple maintenance costs from repository scale, reducing overhead by 95.7%; and (3) Operating as a unified interface for structure-aware navigation. In evaluations, RPG-Encoder establishes state-of-the-art repository understanding on SWE-bench Verified with 93.7% Acc@5 and exceeds the best baseline by over 10% on SWE-bench Live Lite. These results highlight our superior fine-grained localization accuracy in complex codebases. Furthermore, it achieves 98.5% reconstruction coverage on RepoCraft, confirming RPG's high-fidelity capacity to mirror the original codebase and closing the loop between intent and implementation."

UniReason integrates text-to-image generation and image editing through a dual reasoning paradigm that enhances planning with world knowledge and uses editing for visual refinement, achieving superior performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Unified multimodal models often struggle with complex synthesis tasks that demand deep reasoning, and typically treat text-to-image generation and image editing as isolated capabilities rather than interconnected reasoning steps. To address this, we propose UniReason, a unified framework that harmonizes these two tasks through a dual reasoning paradigm. We formulate generation as world knowledge-enhanced planning to inject implicit constraints, and leverage editing capabilities for fine-grained visual refinement to further correct visual errors via self-reflection. This approach unifies generation and editing within a shared representation, mirroring the human cognitive process of planning followed by refinement. We support this framework by systematically constructing a large-scale reasoning-centric dataset (~300k samples) covering five major knowledge domains (e.g., cultural commonsense, physics, etc.) for planning, alongside an agent-generated corpus for visual self-correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniReason achieves advanced performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks such as WISE, KrisBench and UniREditBench, while maintaining superior general synthesis capabilities.

WildGraphBench evaluates GraphRAG performance in realistic scenarios using Wikipedia's structured content to assess multi-fact aggregation and summarization capabilities across diverse document types.  					AI-generated summary 				 Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) organizes external knowledge as a hierarchical graph, enabling efficient retrieval and aggregation of scattered evidence across multiple documents. However, many existing benchmarks for GraphRAG rely on short, curated passages as external knowledge, failing to adequately evaluate systems in realistic settings involving long contexts and large-scale heterogeneous documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce WildGraphBench, a benchmark designed to assess GraphRAG performance in the wild. We leverage Wikipedia's unique structure, where cohesive narratives are grounded in long and heterogeneous external reference documents, to construct a benchmark reflecting real-word scenarios. Specifically, we sample articles across 12 top-level topics, using their external references as the retrieval corpus and citation-linked statements as ground truth, resulting in 1,100 questions spanning three levels of complexity: single-fact QA, multi-fact QA, and section-level summarization. Experiments across multiple baselines reveal that current GraphRAG pipelines help on multi-fact aggregation when evidence comes from a moderate number of sources, but this aggregation paradigm may overemphasize high-level statements at the expense of fine-grained details, leading to weaker performance on summarization tasks.

A file-system-based dual-agent framework enables large language model agents to perform extended research tasks beyond context window limitations by using persistent storage as external memory.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep research is emerging as a representative long-horizon task for large language model (LLM) agents. However, long trajectories in deep research often exceed model context limits, compressing token budgets for both evidence collection and report writing, and preventing effective test-time scaling. We introduce FS-Researcher, a file-system-based, dual-agent framework that scales deep research beyond the context window via a persistent workspace. Specifically, a Context Builder agent acts as a librarian which browses the internet, writes structured notes, and archives raw sources into a hierarchical knowledge base that can grow far beyond context length. A Report Writer agent then composes the final report section by section, treating the knowledge base as the source of facts. In this framework, the file system serves as a durable external memory and a shared coordination medium across agents and sessions, enabling iterative refinement beyond the context window. Experiments on two open-ended benchmarks (DeepResearch Bench and DeepConsult) show that FS-Researcher achieves state-of-the-art report quality across different backbone models. Further analyses demonstrate a positive correlation between final report quality and the computation allocated to the Context Builder, validating effective test-time scaling under the file-system paradigm. The code and data are anonymously open-sourced at https://github.com/Ignoramus0817/FS-Researcher.

"A file-system-based dual-agent framework enables large language model agents to perform extended research tasks beyond context window limitations by using persistent storage as external memory.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep research is emerging as a representative long-horizon task for large language model (LLM) agents. However, long trajectories in deep research often exceed model context limits, compressing token budgets for both evidence collection and report writing, and preventing effective test-time scaling. We introduce FS-Researcher, a file-system-based, dual-agent framework that scales deep research beyond the context window via a persistent workspace. Specifically, a Context Builder agent acts as a librarian which browses the internet, writes structured notes, and archives raw sources into a hierarchical knowledge base that can grow far beyond context length. A Report Writer agent then composes the final report section by section, treating the knowledge base as the source of facts. In this framework, the file system serves as a durable external memory and a shared coordination medium across agents and sessions, enabling iterative refinement beyond the context window. Experiments on two open-ended benchmarks (DeepResearch Bench and DeepConsult) show that FS-Researcher achieves state-of-the-art report quality across different backbone models. Further analyses demonstrate a positive correlation between final report quality and the computation allocated to the Context Builder, validating effective test-time scaling under the file-system paradigm. The code and data are anonymously open-sourced at https://github.com/Ignoramus0817/FS-Researcher."

A scalable framework for constructing real-world software engineering environments from GitHub pull requests using an efficient building agent with self-verification and hacking detection capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose SWE-Universe, a scalable and efficient framework for automatically constructing real-world software engineering (SWE) verifiable environments from GitHub pull requests (PRs). To overcome the prevalent challenges of automatic building, such as low production yield, weak verifiers, and prohibitive cost, our framework utilizes a building agent powered by an efficient custom-trained model. This agent employs iterative self-verification and in-loop hacking detection to ensure the reliable generation of high-fidelity, verifiable tasks. Using this method, we scale the number of real-world multilingual SWE environments to a million scale (807,693). We demonstrate the profound value of our environments through large-scale agentic mid-training and reinforcement learning. Finally, we applied this technique to Qwen3-Max-Thinking and achieved a score of 75.3% on SWE-Bench Verified. Our work provides both a critical resource and a robust methodology to advance the next generation of coding agents.

Deep Research Agents demonstrate capabilities in autonomous information retrieval but show significant gaps when evaluated against expert-level Wikipedia articles using a new live benchmark and comprehensive evaluation framework.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep Research Agents (DRAs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in autonomous information retrieval and report generation, showing great potential to assist humans in complex research tasks. Current evaluation frameworks primarily rely on LLM-generated references or LLM-derived evaluation dimensions. While these approaches offer scalability, they often lack the reliability of expert-verified content and struggle to provide objective, fine-grained assessments of critical dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Wiki Live Challenge (WLC), a live benchmark that leverages the newest Wikipedia Good Articles (GAs) as expert-level references. Wikipedia's strict standards for neutrality, comprehensiveness, and verifiability serve as a great challenge for DRAs, with GAs representing the pinnacle of which. We curate a dataset of 100 recent Good Articles and propose Wiki Eval, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising a fine-grained evaluation method with 39 criteria for writing quality and rigorous metrics for factual verifiability. Extensive experiments on various DRA systems demonstrate a significant gap between current DRAs and human expert-level Wikipedia articles, validating the effectiveness of WLC in advancing agent research.

PixelGen is a pixel-space diffusion framework that uses perceptual supervision through LPIPS and DINO-based losses to generate high-quality images without requiring VAEs or latent representations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Pixel diffusion generates images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end manner, avoiding the artifacts and bottlenecks introduced by VAEs in two-stage latent diffusion. However, it is challenging to optimize high-dimensional pixel manifolds that contain many perceptually irrelevant signals, leaving existing pixel diffusion methods lagging behind latent diffusion models. We propose PixelGen, a simple pixel diffusion framework with perceptual supervision. Instead of modeling the full image manifold, PixelGen introduces two complementary perceptual losses to guide diffusion model towards learning a more meaningful perceptual manifold. An LPIPS loss facilitates learning better local patterns, while a DINO-based perceptual loss strengthens global semantics. With perceptual supervision, PixelGen surpasses strong latent diffusion baselines. It achieves an FID of 5.11 on ImageNet-256 without classifier-free guidance using only 80 training epochs, and demonstrates favorable scaling performance on large-scale text-to-image generation with a GenEval score of 0.79. PixelGen requires no VAEs, no latent representations, and no auxiliary stages, providing a simpler yet more powerful generative paradigm. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Zehong-Ma/PixelGen.

SLIME is a novel reference-free alignment objective for large language models that decouples preference learning from generation quality through a three-pronged approach combining likelihood maximization, probability stabilization, and dual-margin constraints.  					AI-generated summary 				 Direct preference optimization methods have emerged as a computationally efficient alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs). Latest approaches have streamlined the alignment process by deriving implicit reward functions, yet they often suffer from a critical objective mismatch: optimizing the relative margin between chosen and rejected responses does not guarantee the preservation of the chosen response's absolute likelihood. This can lead to ``unlearning'', where the model degrades the probability of high-quality outputs to satisfy margin constraints, and ``formatting collapse'' caused by the over-penalization of rejected sequences. In this work, we introduce SLIME (Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement), a reference-free alignment objective designed to decouple preference learning from generation quality. SLIME incorporates a three-pronged objective: (1) an anchoring term to maximize the likelihood of preferred responses; (2) a stabilizing penalty that prevents the probabilities of rejected tokens from collapsing to zero; and (3) a dual-margin mechanism that combines hard and soft constraints for precise boundary shaping. Our results demonstrate that SLIME achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining higher generation stability.

RLAnything enhances reinforcement learning for LLMs and agents through dynamic model optimization and closed-loop feedback mechanisms that improve policy and reward model training.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose RLAnything, a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically forges environment, policy, and reward models through closed-loop optimization, amplifying learning signals and strengthening the overall RL system for any LLM or agentic scenarios. Specifically, the policy is trained with integrated feedback from step-wise and outcome signals, while the reward model is jointly optimized via consistency feedback, which in turn further improves policy training. Moreover, our theory-motivated automatic environment adaptation improves training for both the reward and policy models by leveraging critic feedback from each, enabling learning from experience. Empirically, each added component consistently improves the overall system, and RLAnything yields substantial gains across various representative LLM and agentic tasks, boosting Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking by 9.1% on OSWorld and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct by 18.7% and 11.9% on AlfWorld and LiveBench, respectively.

"RLAnything enhances reinforcement learning for LLMs and agents through dynamic model optimization and closed-loop feedback mechanisms that improve policy and reward model training.  					AI-generated summary 				 We propose RLAnything, a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically forges environment, policy, and reward models through closed-loop optimization, amplifying learning signals and strengthening the overall RL system for any LLM or agentic scenarios. Specifically, the policy is trained with integrated feedback from step-wise and outcome signals, while the reward model is jointly optimized via consistency feedback, which in turn further improves policy training. Moreover, our theory-motivated automatic environment adaptation improves training for both the reward and policy models by leveraging critic feedback from each, enabling learning from experience. Empirically, each added component consistently improves the overall system, and RLAnything yields substantial gains across various representative LLM and agentic tasks, boosting Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking by 9.1% on OSWorld and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct by 18.7% and 11.9% on AlfWorld and LiveBench, respectively. We also that optimized reward-model signals outperform outcomes that rely on human labels. Code: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/Open-AgentRL"

PISCES is an annotation-free text-to-video generation method that uses dual optimal transport-aligned rewards to improve visual quality and semantic alignment without human preference annotations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-video (T2V) generation aims to synthesize videos with high visual quality and temporal consistency that are semantically aligned with input text. Reward-based post-training has emerged as a promising direction to improve the quality and semantic alignment of generated videos. However, recent methods either rely on large-scale human preference annotations or operate on misaligned embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models, leading to limited scalability or suboptimal supervision. We present PISCES, an annotation-free post-training algorithm that addresses these limitations via a novel Dual Optimal Transport (OT)-aligned Rewards module. To align reward signals with human judgment, PISCES uses OT to bridge text and video embeddings at both distributional and discrete token levels, enabling reward supervision to fulfill two objectives: (i) a Distributional OT-aligned Quality Reward that captures overall visual quality and temporal coherence; and (ii) a Discrete Token-level OT-aligned Semantic Reward that enforces semantic, spatio-temporal correspondence between text and video tokens. To our knowledge, PISCES is the first to improve annotation-free reward supervision in generative post-training through the lens of OT. Experiments on both short- and long-video generation show that PISCES outperforms both annotation-based and annotation-free methods on VBench across Quality and Semantic scores, with human preference studies further validating its effectiveness. We show that the Dual OT-aligned Rewards module is compatible with multiple optimization paradigms, including direct backpropagation and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.

Mind-Brush presents a unified agentic framework for text-to-image generation that dynamically retrieves multimodal evidence and employs reasoning tools to improve understanding of implicit user intentions and complex knowledge reasoning.  					AI-generated summary 				 While text-to-image generation has achieved unprecedented fidelity, the vast majority of existing models function fundamentally as static text-to-pixel decoders. Consequently, they often fail to grasp implicit user intentions. Although emerging unified understanding-generation models have improved intent comprehension, they still struggle to accomplish tasks involving complex knowledge reasoning within a single model. Moreover, constrained by static internal priors, these models remain unable to adapt to the evolving dynamics of the real world. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Mind-Brush, a unified agentic framework that transforms generation into a dynamic, knowledge-driven workflow. Simulating a human-like 'think-research-create' paradigm, Mind-Brush actively retrieves multimodal evidence to ground out-of-distribution concepts and employs reasoning tools to resolve implicit visual constraints. To rigorously evaluate these capabilities, we propose Mind-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 500 distinct samples spanning real-time news, emerging concepts, and domains such as mathematical and Geo-Reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mind-Brush significantly enhances the capabilities of unified models, realizing a zero-to-one capability leap for the Qwen-Image baseline on Mind-Bench, while achieving superior results on established benchmarks like WISE and RISE.

A novel Causal Forcing method addresses the architectural gap in distilling bidirectional video diffusion models into autoregressive models by using AR teachers for ODE initialization, significantly improving video generation performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 To achieve real-time interactive video generation, current methods distill pretrained bidirectional video diffusion models into few-step autoregressive (AR) models, facing an architectural gap when full attention is replaced by causal attention. However, existing approaches do not bridge this gap theoretically. They initialize the AR student via ODE distillation, which requires frame-level injectivity, where each noisy frame must map to a unique clean frame under the PF-ODE of an AR teacher. Distilling an AR student from a bidirectional teacher violates this condition, preventing recovery of the teacher's flow map and instead inducing a conditional-expectation solution, which degrades performance. To address this issue, we propose Causal Forcing that uses an AR teacher for ODE initialization, thereby bridging the architectural gap. Empirical results show that our method outperforms all baselines across all metrics, surpassing the SOTA Self Forcing by 19.3\% in Dynamic Degree, 8.7\% in VisionReward, and 16.7\% in Instruction Following.

"A novel Causal Forcing method addresses the architectural gap in distilling bidirectional video diffusion models into autoregressive models by using AR teachers for ODE initialization, significantly improving video generation performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 To achieve real-time interactive video generation, current methods distill pretrained bidirectional video diffusion models into few-step autoregressive (AR) models, facing an architectural gap when full attention is replaced by causal attention. However, existing approaches do not bridge this gap theoretically. They initialize the AR student via ODE distillation, which requires frame-level injectivity, where each noisy frame must map to a unique clean frame under the PF-ODE of an AR teacher. Distilling an AR student from a bidirectional teacher violates this condition, preventing recovery of the teacher's flow map and instead inducing a conditional-expectation solution, which degrades performance. To address this issue, we propose Causal Forcing that uses an AR teacher for ODE initialization, thereby bridging the architectural gap. Empirical results show that our method outperforms all baselines across all metrics, surpassing the SOTA Self Forcing by 19.3\% in Dynamic Degree, 8.7\% in VisionReward, and 16.7\% in Instruction Following.

Autoregressive video diffusion models face efficiency challenges due to growing KV caches and redundant attention computations, which are addressed through TempCache, AnnCA, and AnnSA techniques that reduce computational demands while maintaining visual quality and stable performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autoregressive video diffusion models enable streaming generation, opening the door to long-form synthesis, video world models, and interactive neural game engines. However, their core attention layers become a major bottleneck at inference time: as generation progresses, the KV cache grows, causing both increasing latency and escalating GPU memory, which in turn restricts usable temporal context and harms long-range consistency. In this work, we study redundancy in autoregressive video diffusion and identify three persistent sources: near-duplicate cached keys across frames, slowly evolving (largely semantic) queries/keys that make many attention computations redundant, and cross-attention over long prompts where only a small subset of tokens matters per frame. Building on these observations, we propose a unified, training-free attention framework for autoregressive diffusion: TempCache compresses the KV cache via temporal correspondence to bound cache growth; AnnCA accelerates cross-attention by selecting frame-relevant prompt tokens using fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) matching; and AnnSA sparsifies self-attention by restricting each query to semantically matched keys, also using a lightweight ANN. Together, these modules reduce attention, compute, and memory and are compatible with existing autoregressive diffusion backbones and world models. Experiments demonstrate up to x5--x10 end-to-end speedups while preserving near-identical visual quality and, crucially, maintaining stable throughput and nearly constant peak GPU memory usage over long rollouts, where prior methods progressively slow down and suffer from increasing memory usage.

Selective knowledge distillation in autoregressive language models using student-entropy-guided position selection improves accuracy and efficiency while reducing memory and storage requirements.  					AI-generated summary 				 Growing efforts to improve knowledge distillation (KD) in large language models (LLMs) replace dense teacher supervision with selective distillation, which uses a subset of token positions, vocabulary classes, or training samples for supervision. However, it remains unclear which importance signals, selection policies, and their interplay are most effective. In this work, we revisit where and how to distill in autoregressive LLMs. We disentangle selective KD along the position, class, and sample axes and systematically compare importance signals and selection policies. Then, guided by this analysis, we identify underexplored opportunities and introduce student-entropy-guided position selection (SE-KD). Across a suite of benchmarks, SE-KD often improves accuracy, downstream task adherence, and memory efficiency over dense distillation. Extending this approach across the class and sample axes (SE-KD 3X) yields complementary efficiency gains that make offline teacher caching feasible. In practice, this reduces wall time by 70% and peak memory by 18%, while cutting storage usage by 80% over prior methods without sacrificing performance.

MLLMs equipped with Cognitive Supersensing and Latent Visual Imagery Prediction demonstrate enhanced cognitive reasoning capabilities through integrated visual and textual reasoning pathways.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in open-vocabulary perceptual tasks, yet their ability to solve complex cognitive problems remains limited, especially when visual details are abstract and require visual memory. Current approaches primarily scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the text space, even when language alone is insufficient for clear and structured reasoning, and largely neglect visual reasoning mechanisms analogous to the human visuospatial sketchpad and visual imagery. To mitigate this deficiency, we introduce Cognitive Supersensing, a novel training paradigm that endows MLLMs with human-like visual imagery capabilities by integrating a Latent Visual Imagery Prediction (LVIP) head that jointly learns sequences of visual cognitive latent embeddings and aligns them with the answer, thereby forming vision-based internal reasoning chains. We further introduce a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes text reasoning paths based on this grounded visual latent. To evaluate the cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, we present CogSense-Bench, a comprehensive visual question answering (VQA) benchmark assessing five cognitive dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLLMs trained with Cognitive Supersensing significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines on CogSense-Bench and exhibit superior generalization on out-of-domain mathematics and science VQA benchmarks, suggesting that internal visual imagery is potentially key to bridging the gap between perceptual recognition and cognitive understanding. We will open-source the CogSense-Bench and our model weights.

Post-training of reasoning large language models can be improved by correcting distribution mismatches between supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning stages through importance sampling reweighting of the SFT loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 Post-training of reasoning LLMs is a holistic process that typically consists of an offline SFT stage followed by an online reinforcement learning (RL) stage. However, SFT is often optimized in isolation to maximize SFT performance alone.   We show that, after identical RL training, models initialized from stronger SFT checkpoints can significantly underperform those initialized from weaker ones. We attribute this to a mismatch typical in current SFT-RL pipelines: the distribution that generates the offline SFT data can differ substantially from the policy optimized during online RL, which learns from its own rollouts.   We propose PEAR (Policy Evaluation-inspired Algorithm for Offline Learning Loss Re-weighting), an SFT-stage method that corrects this mismatch and better prepares the model for RL. PEAR uses importance sampling to reweight the SFT loss, with three variants operating at the token, block, and sequence levels. It can be used to augment standard SFT objectives and incurs little additional training overhead once probabilities for the offline data are collected.   We conduct controlled experiments on verifiable reasoning games and mathematical reasoning tasks on Qwen 2.5 and 3 and DeepSeek-distilled models. PEAR consistently improves post-RL performance over canonical SFT, with pass at 8 gains up to a 14.6 percent on AIME2025. Our results suggest that PEAR is an effective step toward more holistic LLM post-training by designing and evaluating SFT with downstream RL in mind rather than in isolation.

"Post-training of reasoning large language models can be improved by correcting distribution mismatches between supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning stages through importance sampling reweighting of the SFT loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 Post-training of reasoning LLMs is a holistic process that typically consists of an offline SFT stage followed by an online reinforcement learning (RL) stage. However, SFT is often optimized in isolation to maximize SFT performance alone.   We show that, after identical RL training, models initialized from stronger SFT checkpoints can significantly underperform those initialized from weaker ones. We attribute this to a mismatch typical in current SFT-RL pipelines: the distribution that generates the offline SFT data can differ substantially from the policy optimized during online RL, which learns from its own rollouts.   We propose PEAR (Policy Evaluation-inspired Algorithm for Offline Learning Loss Re-weighting), an SFT-stage method that corrects this mismatch and better prepares the model for RL. PEAR uses importance sampling to reweight the SFT loss, with three variants operating at the token, block, and sequence levels. It can be used to augment standard SFT objectives and incurs little additional training overhead once probabilities for the offline data are collected.   We conduct controlled experiments on verifiable reasoning games and mathematical reasoning tasks on Qwen 2.5 and 3 and DeepSeek-distilled models. PEAR consistently improves post-RL performance over canonical SFT, with pass at 8 gains up to a 14.6 percent on AIME2025. Our results suggest that PEAR is an effective step toward more holistic LLM post-training by designing and evaluating SFT with downstream RL in mind rather than in isolation."

Visual Instruction Benchmark for Image Editing introduces a three-level interaction hierarchy for evaluating visual instruction following capabilities in generative models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent generative models have achieved remarkable progress in image editing. However, existing systems and benchmarks remain largely text-guided. In contrast, human communication is inherently multimodal, where visual instructions such as sketches efficiently convey spatial and structural intent. To address this gap, we introduce VIBE, the Visual Instruction Benchmark for Image Editing with a three-level interaction hierarchy that captures deictic grounding, morphological manipulation, and causal reasoning. Across these levels, we curate high-quality and diverse test cases that reflect progressively increasing complexity in visual instruction following. We further propose a robust LMM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with task-specific metrics to enable scalable and fine-grained assessment. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 17 representative open-source and proprietary image editing models, we find that proprietary models exhibit early-stage visual instruction-following capabilities and consistently outperform open-source models. However, performance degrades markedly with increasing task difficulty even for the strongest systems, highlighting promising directions for future research.

A dual-stream framework called InteractAvatar is presented for generating talking avatars that can interact with objects in their environment, addressing challenges in grounded human-object interaction through decoupled perception and planning modules.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generating talking avatars is a fundamental task in video generation. Although existing methods can generate full-body talking avatars with simple human motion, extending this task to grounded human-object interaction (GHOI) remains an open challenge, requiring the avatar to perform text-aligned interactions with surrounding objects. This challenge stems from the need for environmental perception and the control-quality dilemma in GHOI generation. To address this, we propose a novel dual-stream framework, InteractAvatar, which decouples perception and planning from video synthesis for grounded human-object interaction. Leveraging detection to enhance environmental perception, we introduce a Perception and Interaction Module (PIM) to generate text-aligned interaction motions. Additionally, an Audio-Interaction Aware Generation Module (AIM) is proposed to synthesize vivid talking avatars performing object interactions. With a specially designed motion-to-video aligner, PIM and AIM share a similar network structure and enable parallel co-generation of motions and plausible videos, effectively mitigating the control-quality dilemma. Finally, we establish a benchmark, GroundedInter, for evaluating GHOI video generation. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating grounded human-object interactions for talking avatars. Project page: https://interactavatar.github.io

Visual metaphor transfer enables creative AI systems to decompose abstract conceptual relationships from reference images and reapply them to new subjects through a multi-agent framework grounded in cognitive theory.  					AI-generated summary 				 A visual metaphor constitutes a high-order form of human creativity, employing cross-domain semantic fusion to transform abstract concepts into impactful visual rhetoric. Despite the remarkable progress of generative AI, existing models remain largely confined to pixel-level instruction alignment and surface-level appearance preservation, failing to capture the underlying abstract logic necessary for genuine metaphorical generation. To bridge this gap, we introduce the task of Visual Metaphor Transfer (VMT), which challenges models to autonomously decouple the "creative essence" from a reference image and re-materialize that abstract logic onto a user-specified target subject. We propose a cognitive-inspired, multi-agent framework that operationalizes Conceptual Blending Theory (CBT) through a novel Schema Grammar ("G"). This structured representation decouples relational invariants from specific visual entities, providing a rigorous foundation for cross-domain logic re-instantiation. Our pipeline executes VMT through a collaborative system of specialized agents: a perception agent that distills the reference into a schema, a transfer agent that maintains generic space invariance to discover apt carriers, a generation agent for high-fidelity synthesis and a hierarchical diagnostic agent that mimics a professional critic, performing closed-loop backtracking to identify and rectify errors across abstract logic, component selection, and prompt encoding. Extensive experiments and human evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA baselines in metaphor consistency, analogy appropriateness, and visual creativity, paving the way for automated high-impact creative applications in advertising and media. Source code will be made publicly available.

AI-generated summary 				 A visual metaphor constitutes a high-order form of human creativity, employing cross-domain semantic fusion to transform abstract concepts into impactful visual rhetoric. Despite the remarkable progress of generative AI, existing models remain largely confined to pixel-level instruction alignment and surface-level appearance preservation, failing to capture the underlying abstract logic necessary for genuine metaphorical generation. To bridge this gap, we introduce the task of Visual Metaphor Transfer (VMT), which challenges models to autonomously decouple the "creative essence" from a reference image and re-materialize that abstract logic onto a user-specified target subject. We propose a cognitive-inspired, multi-agent framework that operationalizes Conceptual Blending Theory (CBT) through a novel Schema Grammar ("G"). This structured representation decouples relational invariants from specific visual entities, providing a rigorous foundation for cross-domain logic re-instantiation. Our pipeline executes VMT through a collaborative system of specialized agents: a perception agent that distills the reference into a schema, a transfer agent that maintains generic space invariance to discover apt carriers, a generation agent for high-fidelity synthesis and a hierarchical diagnostic agent that mimics a professional critic, performing closed-loop backtracking to identify and rectify errors across abstract logic, component selection, and prompt encoding. Extensive experiments and human evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA baselines in metaphor consistency, analogy appropriateness, and visual creativity, paving the way for automated high-impact creative applications in advertising and media. Source code will be made publicly available."

Re-TRAC is an agentic framework that enhances LLM-based research agents by enabling cross-trajectory exploration and iterative reflection through structured state representations, leading to more efficient and effective problem-solving compared to traditional ReAct approaches.  					AI-generated summary 				 LLM-based deep research agents are largely built on the ReAct framework. This linear design makes it difficult to revisit earlier states, branch into alternative search directions, or maintain global awareness under long contexts, often leading to local optima, redundant exploration, and inefficient search. We propose Re-TRAC, an agentic framework that performs cross-trajectory exploration by generating a structured state representation after each trajectory to summarize evidence, uncertainties, failures, and future plans, and conditioning subsequent trajectories on this state representation. This enables iterative reflection and globally informed planning, reframing research as a progressive process. Empirical results show that Re-TRAC consistently outperforms ReAct by 15-20% on BrowseComp with frontier LLMs. For smaller models, we introduce Re-TRAC-aware supervised fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales. Notably, Re-TRAC shows a monotonic reduction in tool calls and token usage across rounds, indicating progressively targeted exploration driven by cross-trajectory reflection rather than redundant search.

Large language model control methods are unified under a dynamic weight update framework, revealing a preference-utility trade-off and enabling improved steering through SPLIT approach.  					AI-generated summary 				 Methods for controlling large language models (LLMs), including local weight fine-tuning, LoRA-based adaptation, and activation-based interventions, are often studied in isolation, obscuring their connections and making comparison difficult. In this work, we present a unified view that frames these interventions as dynamic weight updates induced by a control signal, placing them within a single conceptual framework. Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility.

LatentMorph integrates implicit latent reasoning into text-to-image generation through four lightweight components that enable adaptive self-refinement and improve both efficiency and cognitive alignment.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable progress, yet existing methods often lack the ability to dynamically reason and refine during generation--a hallmark of human creativity. Current reasoning-augmented paradigms most rely on explicit thought processes, where intermediate reasoning is decoded into discrete text at fixed steps with frequent image decoding and re-encoding, leading to inefficiencies, information loss, and cognitive mismatches. To bridge this gap, we introduce LatentMorph, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates implicit latent reasoning into the T2I generation process. At its core, LatentMorph introduces four lightweight components: (i) a condenser for summarizing intermediate generation states into compact visual memory, (ii) a translator for converting latent thoughts into actionable guidance, (iii) a shaper for dynamically steering next image token predictions, and (iv) an RL-trained invoker for adaptively determining when to invoke reasoning. By performing reasoning entirely in continuous latent spaces, LatentMorph avoids the bottlenecks of explicit reasoning and enables more adaptive self-refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LatentMorph (I) enhances the base model Janus-Pro by 16% on GenEval and 25% on T2I-CompBench; (II) outperforms explicit paradigms (e.g., TwiG) by 15% and 11% on abstract reasoning tasks like WISE and IPV-Txt, (III) while reducing inference time by 44% and token consumption by 51%; and (IV) exhibits 71% cognitive alignment with human intuition on reasoning invocation.

Visual world models for mobile GUI agents are improved through renderable code generation using vision-language models, achieving better performance with reduced model size compared to existing approaches.  					AI-generated summary 				 Mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) World Models (WMs) offer a promising path for improving mobile GUI agent performance at train- and inference-time. However, current approaches face a critical trade-off: text-based WMs sacrifice visual fidelity, while the inability of visual WMs in precise text rendering led to their reliance on slow, complex pipelines dependent on numerous external models. We propose a novel paradigm: visual world modeling via renderable code generation, where a single Vision-Language Model (VLM) predicts the next GUI state as executable web code that renders to pixels, rather than generating pixels directly. This combines the strengths of both approaches: VLMs retain their linguistic priors for precise text rendering while their pre-training on structured web code enables high-fidelity visual generation. We introduce gWorld (8B, 32B), the first open-weight visual mobile GUI WMs built on this paradigm, along with a data generation framework (gWorld) that automatically synthesizes code-based training data. In extensive evaluation across 4 in- and 2 out-of-distribution benchmarks, gWorld sets a new pareto frontier in accuracy versus model size, outperforming 8 frontier open-weight models over 50.25x larger. Further analyses show that (1) scaling training data via gWorld yields meaningful gains, (2) each component of our pipeline improves data quality, and (3) stronger world modeling improves downstream mobile GUI policy performance.

A Japanese financial language understanding benchmark named Ebisu is introduced, featuring two expert-annotated tasks that evaluate implicit commitment recognition and hierarchical financial terminology extraction, revealing persistent challenges for current language models despite their advanced capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Japanese finance combines agglutinative, head-final linguistic structure, mixed writing systems, and high-context communication norms that rely on indirect expression and implicit commitment, posing a substantial challenge for LLMs. We introduce Ebisu, a benchmark for native Japanese financial language understanding, comprising two linguistically and culturally grounded, expert-annotated tasks: JF-ICR, which evaluates implicit commitment and refusal recognition in investor-facing Q&A, and JF-TE, which assesses hierarchical extraction and ranking of nested financial terminology from professional disclosures. We evaluate a diverse set of open-source and proprietary LLMs spanning general-purpose, Japanese-adapted, and financial models. Results show that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on both tasks. While increased model scale yields limited improvements, language- and domain-specific adaptation does not reliably improve performance, leaving substantial gaps unresolved. Ebisu provides a focused benchmark for advancing linguistically and culturally grounded financial NLP. All datasets and evaluation scripts are publicly released.

"A Japanese financial language understanding benchmark named Ebisu is introduced, featuring two expert-annotated tasks that evaluate implicit commitment recognition and hierarchical financial terminology extraction, revealing persistent challenges for current language models despite their advanced capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Japanese finance combines agglutinative, head-final linguistic structure, mixed writing systems, and high-context communication norms that rely on indirect expression and implicit commitment, posing a substantial challenge for LLMs. We introduce Ebisu, a benchmark for native Japanese financial language understanding, comprising two linguistically and culturally grounded, expert-annotated tasks: JF-ICR, which evaluates implicit commitment and refusal recognition in investor-facing Q&A, and JF-TE, which assesses hierarchical extraction and ranking of nested financial terminology from professional disclosures. We evaluate a diverse set of open-source and proprietary LLMs spanning general-purpose, Japanese-adapted, and financial models. Results show that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on both tasks. While increased model scale yields limited improvements, language- and domain-specific adaptation does not reliably improve performance, leaving substantial gaps unresolved. Ebisu provides a focused benchmark for advancing linguistically and culturally grounded financial NLP. All datasets and evaluation scripts are publicly released."

SPARKLING is a framework for mid-stage width expansion in deep learning models that maintains signal preservation and breaks symmetry to stabilize training and reduce computational costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Progressive Learning (PL) reduces pre-training computational overhead by gradually increasing model scale. While prior work has extensively explored depth expansion, width expansion remains significantly understudied, with the few existing methods limited to the early stages of training. However, expanding width during the mid-stage is essential for maximizing computational savings, yet it remains a formidable challenge due to severe training instabilities. Empirically, we show that naive initialization at this stage disrupts activation statistics, triggering loss spikes, while copy-based initialization introduces gradient symmetry that hinders feature diversity. To address these issues, we propose SPARKLING (balancing {S}ignal {P}reservation {A}nd symmet{R}y brea{K}ing for width-progressive {L}earn{ING}), a novel framework for mid-stage width expansion. Our method achieves signal preservation via RMS-scale consistency, stabilizing activation statistics during expansion. Symmetry breaking is ensured through asymmetric optimizer state resetting and learning rate re-warmup. Extensive experiments on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models demonstrate that, across multiple width axes and optimizer families, SPARKLING consistently outperforms training from scratch and reduces training cost by up to 35% under 2times width expansion.

Loop-ViT introduces a recursive vision transformer architecture that decouples reasoning depth from model capacity through weight-tied recurrence and dynamic exit mechanisms, achieving superior visual reasoning performance with fewer parameters.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in visual reasoning have leveraged vision transformers to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark. However, we argue that the feed-forward architecture, where computational depth is strictly bound to parameter size, falls short of capturing the iterative, algorithmic nature of human induction. In this work, we propose a recursive architecture called Loop-ViT, which decouples reasoning depth from model capacity through weight-tied recurrence. Loop-ViT iterates a weight-tied Hybrid Block, combining local convolutions and global attention, to form a latent chain of thought. Crucially, we introduce a parameter-free Dynamic Exit mechanism based on predictive entropy: the model halts inference when its internal state ``crystallizes" into a low-uncertainty attractor. Empirical results on the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark validate this perspective: our 18M model achieves 65.8% accuracy, outperforming massive 73M-parameter ensembles. These findings demonstrate that adaptive iterative computation offers a far more efficient scaling axis for visual reasoning than simply increasing network width. The code is available at https://github.com/WenjieShu/LoopViT.

PolySAE extends sparse autoencoders with polynomial decoding to capture feature interactions and compositional structure while maintaining linear encoders for interpretability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising method for interpreting neural network representations by decomposing activations into sparse combinations of dictionary atoms. However, SAEs assume that features combine additively through linear reconstruction, an assumption that cannot capture compositional structure: linear models cannot distinguish whether "Starbucks" arises from the composition of "star" and "coffee" features or merely their co-occurrence. This forces SAEs to allocate monolithic features for compound concepts rather than decomposing them into interpretable constituents. We introduce PolySAE, which extends the SAE decoder with higher-order terms to model feature interactions while preserving the linear encoder essential for interpretability. Through low-rank tensor factorization on a shared projection subspace, PolySAE captures pairwise and triple feature interactions with small parameter overhead (3% on GPT2). Across four language models and three SAE variants, PolySAE achieves an average improvement of approximately 8% in probing F1 while maintaining comparable reconstruction error, and produces 2-10times larger Wasserstein distances between class-conditional feature distributions. Critically, learned interaction weights exhibit negligible correlation with co-occurrence frequency (r = 0.06 vs. r = 0.82 for SAE feature covariance), suggesting that polynomial terms capture compositional structure, such as morphological binding and phrasal composition, largely independent of surface statistics.

"PolySAE extends sparse autoencoders with polynomial decoding to capture feature interactions and compositional structure while maintaining linear encoders for interpretability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising method for interpreting neural network representations by decomposing activations into sparse combinations of dictionary atoms. However, SAEs assume that features combine additively through linear reconstruction, an assumption that cannot capture compositional structure: linear models cannot distinguish whether "Starbucks" arises from the composition of "star" and "coffee" features or merely their co-occurrence. This forces SAEs to allocate monolithic features for compound concepts rather than decomposing them into interpretable constituents. We introduce PolySAE, which extends the SAE decoder with higher-order terms to model feature interactions while preserving the linear encoder essential for interpretability. Through low-rank tensor factorization on a shared projection subspace, PolySAE captures pairwise and triple feature interactions with small parameter overhead (3% on GPT2). Across four language models and three SAE variants, PolySAE achieves an average improvement of approximately 8% in probing F1 while maintaining comparable reconstruction error, and produces 2-10times larger Wasserstein distances between class-conditional feature distributions. Critically, learned interaction weights exhibit negligible correlation with co-occurrence frequency (r = 0.06 vs. r = 0.82 for SAE feature covariance), suggesting that polynomial terms capture compositional structure, such as morphological binding and phrasal composition, largely independent of surface statistics."

AgentIF-OneDay evaluates AI agents' ability to handle diverse daily tasks through natural language instructions, requiring problem-solving, attachment understanding, and file-based outputs across three user-centric categories.  					AI-generated summary 				 The capacity of AI agents to effectively handle tasks of increasing duration and complexity continues to grow, demonstrating exceptional performance in coding, deep research, and complex problem-solving evaluations. However, in daily scenarios, the perception of these advanced AI capabilities among general users remains limited. We argue that current evaluations prioritize increasing task difficulty without sufficiently addressing the diversity of agentic tasks necessary to cover the daily work, life, and learning activities of a broad demographic. To address this, we propose AgentIF-OneDay, aimed at determining whether general users can utilize natural language instructions and AI agents to complete a diverse array of daily tasks. These tasks require not only solving problems through dialogue but also understanding various attachment types and delivering tangible file-based results. The benchmark is structured around three user-centric categories: Open Workflow Execution, which assesses adherence to explicit and complex workflows; Latent Instruction, which requires agents to infer implicit instructions from attachments; and Iterative Refinement, which involves modifying or expanding upon ongoing work. We employ instance-level rubrics and a refined evaluation pipeline that aligns LLM-based verification with human judgment, achieving an 80.1% agreement rate using Gemini-3-Pro. AgentIF-OneDay comprises 104 tasks covering 767 scoring points. We benchmarked four leading general AI agents and found that agent products built based on APIs and ChatGPT agents based on agent RL remain in the first tier simultaneously. Leading LLM APIs and open-source models have internalized agentic capabilities, enabling AI application teams to develop cutting-edge Agent products.

Thinking with Comics emerges as an effective visual reasoning approach that bridges images and videos by leveraging comic structures for improved multimodal reasoning efficiency and performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Chain-of-Thought reasoning has driven large language models to extend from thinking with text to thinking with images and videos. However, different modalities still have clear limitations: static images struggle to represent temporal structure, while videos introduce substantial redundancy and computational cost. In this work, we propose Thinking with Comics, a visual reasoning paradigm that uses comics as a high information-density medium positioned between images and videos. Comics preserve temporal structure, embedded text, and narrative coherence while requiring significantly lower reasoning cost. We systematically study two reasoning paths based on comics and evaluate them on a range of reasoning tasks and long-context understanding tasks. Experimental results show that Thinking with Comics outperforms Thinking with Images on multi-step temporal and causal reasoning tasks, while remaining substantially more efficient than Thinking with Video. Further analysis indicates that different comic narrative structures and styles consistently affect performance across tasks, suggesting that comics serve as an effective intermediate visual representation for improving multimodal reasoning.

TRIP-Bench presents a comprehensive long-horizon benchmark for travel planning that evaluates LLM agents on complex multi-turn interactions, while GTPO offers an online reinforcement learning approach to enhance constraint satisfaction and robustness in extended dialogues.  					AI-generated summary 				 As LLM-based agents are deployed in increasingly complex real-world settings, existing benchmarks underrepresent key challenges such as enforcing global constraints, coordinating multi-tool reasoning, and adapting to evolving user behavior over long, multi-turn interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIP-Bench, a long-horizon benchmark grounded in realistic travel-planning scenarios. TRIP-Bench leverages real-world data, offers 18 curated tools and 40+ travel requirements, and supports automated evaluation. It includes splits of varying difficulty; the hard split emphasizes long and ambiguous interactions, style shifts, feasibility changes, and iterative version revision. Dialogues span up to 15 user turns, can involve 150+ tool calls, and may exceed 200k tokens of context. Experiments show that even advanced models achieve at most 50\% success on the easy split, with performance dropping below 10\% on hard subsets. We further propose GTPO, an online multi-turn reinforcement learning method with specialized reward normalization and reward differencing. Applied to Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GTPO improves constraint satisfaction and interaction robustness, outperforming Gemini-3-Pro in our evaluation. We expect TRIP-Bench to advance practical long-horizon interactive agents, and GTPO to provide an effective online RL recipe for robust long-horizon training.

A novel framework called CoDiQ enables controllable difficulty generation for competition-level questions through test-time scaling, resulting in a corpus that significantly improves large reasoning model performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) benefit substantially from training on challenging competition-level questions. However, existing automated question synthesis methods lack precise difficulty control, incur high computational costs, and struggle to generate competition-level questions at scale. In this paper, we propose CoDiQ (Controllable Difficult Question Generation), a novel framework enabling fine-grained difficulty control via test-time scaling while ensuring question solvability. Specifically, first, we identify a test-time scaling tendency (extended reasoning token budget boosts difficulty but reduces solvability) and the intrinsic properties defining the upper bound of a model's ability to generate valid, high-difficulty questions. Then, we develop CoDiQ-Generator from Qwen3-8B, which improves the upper bound of difficult question generation, making it particularly well-suited for challenging question construction. Building on the CoDiQ framework, we build CoDiQ-Corpus (44K competition-grade question sequences). Human evaluations show these questions are significantly more challenging than LiveCodeBench/AIME with over 82% solvability. Training LRMs on CoDiQ-Corpus substantially improves reasoning performance, verifying that scaling controlled-difficulty training questions enhances reasoning capabilities. We open-source CoDiQ-Corpus, CoDiQ-Generator, and implementations to support related research.

Rubric-ARM framework jointly optimizes rubric generation and judging through reinforcement learning to improve response quality assessment in creative and open-ended tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Standard reward models typically predict scalar scores that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of response quality in non-verifiable domains, such as creative writing or open-ended instruction following. To address this limitation, we propose Rubric-ARM, a framework that jointly optimizes a rubric generator and a judge using reinforcement learning from preference feedback. Unlike existing methods that rely on static rubrics or disjoint training pipelines, our approach treats rubric generation as a latent action learned to maximize judgment accuracy. We introduce an alternating optimization strategy to mitigate the non-stationarity of simultaneous updates, providing theoretical analysis that demonstrates how this schedule reduces gradient variance during training. Extensive experiments show that Rubric-ARM achieves state-of-the-art performance among baselines on multiple benchmarks and significantly improves downstream policy alignment in both offline and online reinforcement learning settings.

"Rubric-ARM framework jointly optimizes rubric generation and judging through reinforcement learning to improve response quality assessment in creative and open-ended tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Standard reward models typically predict scalar scores that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of response quality in non-verifiable domains, such as creative writing or open-ended instruction following. To address this limitation, we propose Rubric-ARM, a framework that jointly optimizes a rubric generator and a judge using reinforcement learning from preference feedback. Unlike existing methods that rely on static rubrics or disjoint training pipelines, our approach treats rubric generation as a latent action learned to maximize judgment accuracy. We introduce an alternating optimization strategy to mitigate the non-stationarity of simultaneous updates, providing theoretical analysis that demonstrates how this schedule reduces gradient variance during training. Extensive experiments show that Rubric-ARM achieves state-of-the-art performance among baselines on multiple benchmarks and significantly improves downstream policy alignment in both offline and online reinforcement learning settings."

Flow matching models for text-to-image generation are enhanced through a reinforcement learning framework that addresses sample inefficiency and prompt overfitting by incorporating language models for prompt refinement, achieving superior performance with reduced computational requirements.  					AI-generated summary 				 Flow matching models (FMs) have revolutionized text-to-image (T2I) generation, with reinforcement learning (RL) serving as a critical post-training strategy for alignment with reward objectives. In this research, we show that current RL pipelines for FMs suffer from two underappreciated yet important limitations: sample inefficiency due to insufficient generation diversity, and pronounced prompt overfitting, where models memorize specific training formulations and exhibit dramatic performance collapse when evaluated on semantically equivalent but stylistically varied prompts. We present PromptRL (Prompt Matters in RL for Flow-Based Image Generation), a framework that incorporates language models (LMs) as trainable prompt refinement agents directly within the flow-based RL optimization loop. This design yields two complementary benefits: rapid development of sophisticated prompt rewriting capabilities and, critically, a synergistic training regime that reshapes the optimization dynamics. PromptRL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, obtaining scores of 0.97 on GenEval, 0.98 on OCR accuracy, and 24.05 on PickScore.   Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our RL approach on large-scale image editing models, improving the EditReward of FLUX.1-Kontext from 1.19 to 1.43 with only 0.06 million rollouts, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (also known as Nano Banana), which scores 1.37, and achieving comparable performance with ReasonNet (1.44), which relied on fine-grained data annotations along with a complex multi-stage training. Our extensive experiments empirically demonstrate that PromptRL consistently achieves higher performance ceilings while requiring over 2times fewer rollouts compared to naive flow-only RL.

AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we identify a sparse reward subsystem within the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs), drawing an analogy to the biological reward subsystem in the human brain. We demonstrate that this subsystem contains value neurons that represent the model's internal expectation of state value, and through intervention experiments, we establish the importance of these neurons for reasoning. Our experiments reveal that these value neurons are robust across diverse datasets, model scales, and architectures; furthermore, they exhibit significant transferability across different datasets and models fine-tuned from the same base model. By examining cases where value predictions and actual rewards diverge, we identify dopamine neurons within the reward subsystem which encode reward prediction errors (RPE). These neurons exhibit high activation when the reward is higher than expected and low activation when the reward is lower than expected.

Adaptive Ability Decomposing (A²D) enhances reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by decomposing complex questions into simpler sub-questions, improving LLM reasoning through guided exploration without requiring a teacher model.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great potential to enhance the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). However, due to the limited amount of information provided during the RLVR process, the model can only engage in largely blind exploration, which often results in failure on challenging problems. To provide additional information for the RLVR process without relying on a teacher model, we propose A^2D, an Adaptive Ability Decomposing method for enhancing the effectiveness of RLVR. Specifically, we first train a decomposer via RLVR without distillation, enabling it to decompose complex questions into a set of simpler sub-questions. Next, we use this decomposer to annotate sub-questions for each question in the training dataset, and then train the reasoner under RLVR with sub-question guidance. To better understand A^2D, we first compare its performance with competitive baselines, showing its effectiveness. Next, we observe that our method functions as a plug-and-play module that can be applied to different RLVR algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct an analysis of the decomposer, revealing how the RLVR process affects its performance and behavior, and which type of guidance is better suited for enhancing the reasoner's exploration and exploitation abilities.

"Adaptive Ability Decomposing (A²D) enhances reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by decomposing complex questions into simpler sub-questions, improving LLM reasoning through guided exploration without requiring a teacher model.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great potential to enhance the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). However, due to the limited amount of information provided during the RLVR process, the model can only engage in largely blind exploration, which often results in failure on challenging problems. To provide additional information for the RLVR process without relying on a teacher model, we propose A^2D, an Adaptive Ability Decomposing method for enhancing the effectiveness of RLVR. Specifically, we first train a decomposer via RLVR without distillation, enabling it to decompose complex questions into a set of simpler sub-questions. Next, we use this decomposer to annotate sub-questions for each question in the training dataset, and then train the reasoner under RLVR with sub-question guidance. To better understand A^2D, we first compare its performance with competitive baselines, showing its effectiveness. Next, we observe that our method functions as a plug-and-play module that can be applied to different RLVR algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct an analysis of the decomposer, revealing how the RLVR process affects its performance and behavior, and which type of guidance is better suited for enhancing the reasoner's exploration and exploitation abilities."

Post-training quantization effects in world models reveal unique failure modes and trade-offs between accuracy, bit-width, and planning performance, particularly in encoder-predictor module asymmetries and low-bit rollout stability.  					AI-generated summary 				 World models learn an internal representation of environment dynamics, enabling agents to simulate and reason about future states within a compact latent space for tasks such as planning, prediction, and inference. However, running world models rely on hevay computational cost and memory footprint, making model quantization essential for efficient deployment. To date, the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ) on world models remain largely unexamined. In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of world model quantization using DINO-WM as a representative case, evaluating diverse PTQ methods under both weight-only and joint weight-activation settings. We conduct extensive experiments on different visual planning tasks across a wide range of bit-widths, quantization granularities, and planning horizons up to 50 iterations. Our results show that quantization effects in world models extend beyond standard accuracy and bit-width trade-offs: group-wise weight quantization can stabilize low-bit rollouts, activation quantization granularity yields inconsistent benefits, and quantization sensitivity is highly asymmetric between encoder and predictor modules. Moreover, aggressive low-bit quantization significantly degrades the alignment between the planning objective and task success, leading to failures that cannot be remedied by additional optimization. These findings reveal distinct quantization-induced failure modes in world model-based planning and provide practical guidance for deploying quantized world models under strict computational constraints. The code will be available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/QuantWM.

A new test-time scaling framework called Prism is introduced for discrete diffusion language models that improves reasoning performance through hierarchical trajectory search, local branching with partial remasking, and self-verified feedback mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Inference-time compute has re-emerged as a practical way to improve LLM reasoning. Most test-time scaling (TTS) algorithms rely on autoregressive decoding, which is ill-suited to discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) due to their parallel decoding over the entire sequence. As a result, developing effective and efficient TTS methods to unlock dLLMs' full generative potential remains an underexplored challenge. To address this, we propose Prism (Pruning, Remasking, and Integrated Self-verification Method), an efficient TTS framework for dLLMs that (i) performs Hierarchical Trajectory Search (HTS) which dynamically prunes and reallocates compute in an early-to-mid denoising window, (ii) introduces Local branching with partial remasking to explore diverse implementations while preserving high-confidence tokens, and (iii) replaces external verifiers with Self-Verified Feedback (SVF) obtained via self-evaluation prompts on intermediate completions. Across four mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks on three dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B Instruct, Dream 7B Instruct, and LLaDA 2.0-mini, our Prism achieves a favorable performance-efficiency trade-off, matching best-of-N performance with substantially fewer function evaluations (NFE).

LiP-Map presents a line-plane joint optimization framework that explicitly models learnable line and planar primitives for accurate 3D line mapping in man-made environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 3D line mapping from multi-view RGB images provides a compact and structured visual representation of scenes. We study the problem from a physical and topological perspective: a 3D line most naturally emerges as the edge of a finite 3D planar patch. We present LiP-Map, a line-plane joint optimization framework that explicitly models learnable line and planar primitives. This coupling enables accurate and detailed 3D line mapping while maintaining strong efficiency (typically completing a reconstruction in 3 to 5 minutes per scene). LiP-Map pioneers the integration of planar topology into 3D line mapping, not by imposing pairwise coplanarity constraints but by explicitly constructing interactions between plane and line primitives, thus offering a principled route toward structured reconstruction in man-made environments. On more than 100 scenes from ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, Hypersim, 7Scenes, and Tanks\&Temple, LiP-Map improves both accuracy and completeness over state-of-the-art methods. Beyond line mapping quality, LiP-Map significantly advances line-assisted visual localization, establishing strong performance on 7Scenes. Our code is released at https://github.com/calmke/LiPMAP for reproducible research.

PISA is a novel sparse attention method that improves diffusion transformer efficiency by approximating non-critical attention blocks instead of discarding them, achieving faster processing with maintained quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion Transformers are fundamental for video and image generation, but their efficiency is bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of attention. While block sparse attention accelerates computation by attending only critical key-value blocks, it suffers from degradation at high sparsity by discarding context. In this work, we discover that attention scores of non-critical blocks exhibit distributional stability, allowing them to be approximated accurately and efficiently rather than discarded, which is essentially important for sparse attention design. Motivated by this key insight, we propose PISA, a training-free Piecewise Sparse Attention that covers the full attention span with sub-quadratic complexity. Unlike the conventional keep-or-drop paradigm that directly drop the non-critical block information, PISA introduces a novel exact-or-approximate strategy: it maintains exact computation for critical blocks while efficiently approximating the remainder through block-wise Taylor expansion. This design allows PISA to serve as a faithful proxy to full attention, effectively bridging the gap between speed and quality. Experimental results demonstrate that PISA achieves 1.91 times and 2.57 times speedups on Wan2.1-14B and Hunyuan-Video, respectively, while consistently maintaining the highest quality among sparse attention methods. Notably, even for image generation on FLUX, PISA achieves a 1.2 times acceleration without compromising visual quality. Code is available at: https://github.com/xie-lab-ml/piecewise-sparse-attention.

VisionTrim is a training-free framework that accelerates multimodal large language models by selecting dominant visual tokens and merging them with text-guided complementation, improving efficiency without performance loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) suffer from high computational costs due to excessive visual tokens, particularly in high-resolution and video-based scenarios. Existing token reduction methods typically focus on isolated pipeline components and often neglect textual alignment, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VisionTrim, a unified framework for training-free MLLM acceleration, integrating two effective plug-and-play modules: 1) the Dominant Vision Token Selection (DVTS) module, which preserves essential visual tokens via a global-local view, and 2) the Text-Guided Vision Complement (TGVC) module, which facilitates context-aware token merging guided by textual cues. Extensive experiments across diverse image and video multimodal benchmarks demonstrate the performance superiority of our VisionTrim, advancing practical MLLM deployment in real-world applications.

"VisionTrim is a training-free framework that accelerates multimodal large language models by selecting dominant visual tokens and merging them with text-guided complementation, improving efficiency without performance loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) suffer from high computational costs due to excessive visual tokens, particularly in high-resolution and video-based scenarios. Existing token reduction methods typically focus on isolated pipeline components and often neglect textual alignment, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VisionTrim, a unified framework for training-free MLLM acceleration, integrating two effective plug-and-play modules: 1) the Dominant Vision Token Selection (DVTS) module, which preserves essential visual tokens via a global-local view, and 2) the Text-Guided Vision Complement (TGVC) module, which facilitates context-aware token merging guided by textual cues. Extensive experiments across diverse image and video multimodal benchmarks demonstrate the performance superiority of our VisionTrim, advancing practical MLLM deployment in real-world applications. The code is available at: https://github.com/hanxunyu/VisionTrim."

Small language models can effectively evaluate outputs by leveraging internal representations rather than generating responses, enabling a more efficient and interpretable evaluation approach through a probing-based framework.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as reference-free evaluators via prompting, but this "LLM-as-a-Judge" paradigm is costly, opaque, and sensitive to prompt design. In this work, we investigate whether smaller models can serve as efficient evaluators by leveraging internal representations instead of surface generation. We uncover a consistent empirical pattern: small LMs, despite with weak generative ability, encode rich evaluative signals in their hidden states. This motivates us to propose the Semantic Capacity Asymmetry Hypothesis: evaluation requires significantly less semantic capacity than generation and can be grounded in intermediate representations, suggesting that evaluation does not necessarily need to rely on large-scale generative models but can instead leverage latent features from smaller ones. Our findings motivate a paradigm shift from LLM-as-a-Judge to Representation-as-a-Judge, a decoding-free evaluation strategy that probes internal model structure rather than relying on prompted output. We instantiate this paradigm through INSPECTOR, a probing-based framework that predicts aspect-level evaluation scores from small model representations. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, GPQA) show that INSPECTOR substantially outperforms prompting-based small LMs and closely approximates full LLM judges, while offering a more efficient, reliable, and interpretable alternative for scalable evaluation.

Layer pruning compresses large language models while maintaining classification performance but causes significant degradation in generative reasoning tasks, with limited recovery possible through supervised finetuning on self-generated responses.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent works have shown that layer pruning can compress large language models (LLMs) while retaining strong performance on classification benchmarks with little or no finetuning. However, existing pruning techniques often suffer severe degradation on generative reasoning tasks. Through a systematic study across multiple model families, we find that tasks requiring multi-step reasoning are particularly sensitive to depth reduction. Beyond surface-level text degeneration, we observe degradation of critical algorithmic capabilities, including arithmetic computation for mathematical reasoning and balanced parenthesis generation for code synthesis. Under realistic post-training constraints, without access to pretraining-scale data or compute, we evaluate a simple mitigation strategy based on supervised finetuning with Self-Generated Responses. This approach achieves strong recovery on classification tasks, retaining up to 90\% of baseline performance, and yields substantial gains of up to 20--30 percentage points on generative benchmarks compared to prior post-pruning techniques.

"Layer pruning compresses large language models while maintaining classification performance but causes significant degradation in generative reasoning tasks, with limited recovery possible through supervised finetuning on self-generated responses.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent works have shown that layer pruning can compress large language models (LLMs) while retaining strong performance on classification benchmarks with little or no finetuning. However, existing pruning techniques often suffer severe degradation on generative reasoning tasks.

A training-free framework enables language model agents to automatically create and optimize tools during inference, improving their reasoning capabilities through self-evolution and memory consolidation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) models have effectively extended the question-answering capabilities of LLMs by incorporating external tools. However, real-world scenarios present numerous open-ended problems where fixed tools often fail to meet task requirements. Furthermore, the lack of self-optimization mechanisms means that erroneous tool outputs can mislead the LLM's responses. Additionally, the construction of existing tools entails significant manual effort, which consequently constrains their applicability. Recognizing that the reasoning traces of LLMs encapsulate implicit problem-solving capabilities, we propose UCT, a novel training-free framework that transforms agents from tool users to tool creators. This approach harvests reasoning experiences and distills them into reusable assets. This method transforms the agent from a mere tool user into a tool creator, enabling adaptive tool creation and self-updating during the inference process. We also introduce a memory consolidation mechanism to maintain the tool library, ensuring high reusability of retained experiential memory for subsequent reasoning tasks. This novel automated tool construction paradigm continuously improves tool quality during reasoning, allowing the overall agent system to progress without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method serves as a novel paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of TIR models. In particular, the significant performance gains achieved +20.86%uparrow and +23.04%uparrow on benchmarks across multi-domain mathematical and scientific reasoning tasks validate the self-evolving capability of the agent.

A novel optimizer called Mano is proposed that combines manifold optimization with momentum projection onto tangent spaces, achieving superior performance over AdamW and Muon while reducing memory and computational requirements.  					AI-generated summary 				 While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, the hardware and computational costs for training LLMs are also significantly burdensome. Among the state-of-the-art optimizers, AdamW relies on diagonal curvature estimates and ignores structural properties, while Muon applies global spectral normalization at the expense of losing curvature information. In this study, we restriked manifold optimization methods for training LLMs, which may address both optimizers' limitations, while conventional manifold optimization methods have been largely overlooked due to the poor performance in large-scale model optimization. By innovatively projecting the momentum onto the tangent space of model parameters and constraining it on a rotational Oblique manifold, we propose a novel, powerful, and efficient optimizer **Mano** that is the first to bridge the performance gap between manifold optimization and modern optimizers. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen3 models demonstrate that Mano consistently and significantly outperforms AdamW and Muon even with less memory consumption and computational complexity, respectively, suggesting an expanded Pareto frontier in terms of space and time efficiency.

By innovatively projecting the momentum onto the tangent space of model parameters and constraining it on a rotational Oblique manifold, we propose a novel, powerful, and efficient optimizer **Mano** that is the first to bridge the performance gap between manifold optimization and modern optimizers. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen3 models demonstrate that Mano consistently and significantly outperforms AdamW and Muon even with less memory consumption and computational complexity, respectively, suggesting an expanded Pareto frontier in terms of space and time efficiency."

Effective dimension, an unsupervised geometric metric, strongly predicts neural network performance across different architectures and domains, showing bidirectional causality between representation geometry and accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 We investigate the relationship between representation geometry and neural network performance. Analyzing 52 pretrained ImageNet models across 13 architecture families, we show that effective dimension -- an unsupervised geometric metric -- strongly predicts accuracy. Output effective dimension achieves partial r=0.75 (p < 10^(-10)) after controlling for model capacity, while total compression achieves partial r=-0.72. These findings replicate across ImageNet and CIFAR-10, and generalize to NLP: effective dimension predicts performance for 8 encoder models on SST-2/MNLI and 15 decoder-only LLMs on AG News (r=0.69, p=0.004), while model size does not (r=0.07). We establish bidirectional causality: degrading geometry via noise causes accuracy loss (r=-0.94, p < 10^(-9)), while improving geometry via PCA maintains accuracy across architectures (-0.03pp at 95% variance). This relationship is noise-type agnostic -- Gaussian, Uniform, Dropout, and Salt-and-pepper noise all show |r| > 0.90. These results establish that effective dimension provides domain-agnostic predictive and causal information about neural network performance, computed entirely without labels.

We analyze the balance between these objectives. In addition, we investigate various related applications in real-time rendering and down-stream tasks, e.g. mipmap fitting and INR-space generation.

Controlled cross-lingual evaluation reveals instability in LLM assessment methods when targeting morphologically rich languages, indicating unreliable zero-shot judge transfer for discourse-level tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Cross-lingual evaluation of large language models (LLMs) typically conflates two sources of variance: genuine model performance differences and measurement instability. We investigate evaluation reliability by holding generation conditions constant while varying target language. Using synthetic customer-support dialogues generated with identical parameters across Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, we test whether automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge scoring produce stable model rankings across these morphologically rich, related Finno-Ugric languages. With a small set of Estonian native speaker annotations as a reference point, we find systematic ranking instabilities: surface-level metrics (lexical diversity, surface and semantic similarity) maintain cross-language stability, but pragmatic judgments (coherence, instruction-following) exhibit rank inversions and near-zero correlations. Because generation is controlled, these inconsistencies reflect how judge scoring behaves differently across languages rather than true model differences.   This controlled design provides a diagnostic probe: evaluation methods that fail to maintain stability under identical generation conditions signal transfer failure before deployment. Our findings suggest that zero-shot judge transfer is unreliable for discourse-level assessment in morphologically rich languages, motivating language-specific calibration against targeted human baselines. We release our controlled generation protocol, synthetic data, and evaluation framework to enable replication across language families at https://github.com/isaac-chung/cross-lingual-stability-judges.

"Controlled cross-lingual evaluation reveals instability in LLM assessment methods when targeting morphologically rich languages, indicating unreliable zero-shot judge transfer for discourse-level tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Cross-lingual evaluation of large language models (LLMs) typically conflates two sources of variance: genuine model performance differences and measurement instability. We investigate evaluation reliability by holding generation conditions constant while varying target language. Using synthetic customer-support dialogues generated with identical parameters across Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, we test whether automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge scoring produce stable model rankings across these morphologically rich, related Finno-Ugric languages. With a small set of Estonian native speaker annotations as a reference point, we find systematic ranking instabilities: surface-level metrics (lexical diversity, surface and semantic similarity) maintain cross-language stability, but pragmatic judgments (coherence, instruction-following) exhibit rank inversions and near-zero correlations. Because generation is controlled, these inconsistencies reflect how judge scoring behaves differently across languages rather than true model differences.   This controlled design provides a diagnostic probe: evaluation methods that fail to maintain stability under identical generation conditions signal transfer failure before deployment. Our findings suggest that zero-shot judge transfer is unreliable for discourse-level assessment in morphologically rich languages, motivating language-specific calibration against targeted human baselines.

Generalizable Predictive Prompt Selection (GPS) uses Bayesian inference with a lightweight generative model to efficiently select informative prompts for reinforcement learning-enhanced language models, improving training efficiency and performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models but often involves high computational costs due to rollout-intensive optimization. Online prompt selection presents a plausible solution by prioritizing informative prompts to improve training efficiency. However, current methods either depend on costly, exact evaluations or construct prompt-specific predictive models lacking generalization across prompts. This study introduces Generalizable Predictive Prompt Selection (GPS), which performs Bayesian inference towards prompt difficulty using a lightweight generative model trained on the shared optimization history. Intermediate-difficulty prioritization and history-anchored diversity are incorporated into the batch acquisition principle to select informative prompt batches. The small predictive model also generalizes at test-time for efficient computational allocation. Experiments across varied reasoning benchmarks indicate GPS's substantial improvements in training efficiency, final performance, and test-time efficiency over superior baseline methods.

VAE-based inpainting creates spectral shifts that fool detection systems, which can be mitigated through Inpainting Exchange to improve content-aware detection performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Modern deep learning-based inpainting enables realistic local image manipulation, raising critical challenges for reliable detection. However, we observe that current detectors primarily rely on global artifacts that appear as inpainting side effects, rather than on locally synthesized content. We show that this behavior occurs because VAE-based reconstruction induces a subtle but pervasive spectral shift across the entire image, including unedited regions. To isolate this effect, we introduce Inpainting Exchange (INP-X), an operation that restores original pixels outside the edited region while preserving all synthesized content. We create a 90K test dataset including real, inpainted, and exchanged images to evaluate this phenomenon. Under this intervention, pretrained state-of-the-art detectors, including commercial ones, exhibit a dramatic drop in accuracy (e.g., from 91\% to 55\%), frequently approaching chance level. We provide a theoretical analysis linking this behavior to high-frequency attenuation caused by VAE information bottlenecks. Our findings highlight the need for content-aware detection. Indeed, training on our dataset yields better generalization and localization than standard inpainting. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/emirhanbilgic/INP-X.

Parallel Echo State Network (ParalESN) addresses reservoir computing limitations by enabling parallel temporal processing through diagonal linear recurrence, maintaining theoretical guarantees while achieving significant computational efficiency gains.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reservoir Computing (RC) has established itself as an efficient paradigm for temporal processing. However, its scalability remains severely constrained by (i) the necessity of processing temporal data sequentially and (ii) the prohibitive memory footprint of high-dimensional reservoirs. In this work, we revisit RC through the lens of structured operators and state space modeling to address these limitations, introducing Parallel Echo State Network (ParalESN). ParalESN enables the construction of high-dimensional and efficient reservoirs based on diagonal linear recurrence in the complex space, enabling parallel processing of temporal data. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that ParalESN preserves the Echo State Property and the universality guarantees of traditional Echo State Networks while admitting an equivalent representation of arbitrary linear reservoirs in the complex diagonal form. Empirically, ParalESN matches the predictive accuracy of traditional RC on time series benchmarks, while delivering substantial computational savings. On 1-D pixel-level classification tasks, ParalESN achieves competitive accuracy with fully trainable neural networks while reducing computational costs and energy consumption by orders of magnitude. Overall, ParalESN offers a promising, scalable, and principled pathway for integrating RC within the deep learning landscape.

"Parallel Echo State Network (ParalESN) addresses reservoir computing limitations by enabling parallel temporal processing through diagonal linear recurrence, maintaining theoretical guarantees while achieving significant computational efficiency gains.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reservoir Computing (RC) has established itself as an efficient paradigm for temporal processing. However, its scalability remains severely constrained by (i) the necessity of processing temporal data sequentially and (ii) the prohibitive memory footprint of high-dimensional reservoirs. In this work, we revisit RC through the lens of structured operators and state space modeling to address these limitations, introducing Parallel Echo State Network (ParalESN). ParalESN enables the construction of high-dimensional and efficient reservoirs based on diagonal linear recurrence in the complex space, enabling parallel processing of temporal data. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that ParalESN preserves the Echo State Property and the universality guarantees of traditional Echo State Networks while admitting an equivalent representation of arbitrary linear reservoirs in the complex diagonal form. Empirically, ParalESN matches the predictive accuracy of traditional RC on time series benchmarks, while delivering substantial computational savings. On 1-D pixel-level classification tasks, ParalESN achieves competitive accuracy with fully trainable neural networks while reducing computational costs and energy consumption by orders of magnitude. Overall, ParalESN offers a promising, scalable, and principled pathway for integrating RC within the deep learning landscape."

On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD) enables efficient knowledge transfer from teacher to student models by replacing token-level probability matching with trajectory matching using discrete verbal scores, reducing memory consumption and enabling free exploration without token alignment constraints.  					AI-generated summary 				 Knowledge distillation offers a promising path to transfer reasoning capabilities from large teacher models to efficient student models; however, existing token-level on-policy distillation methods require token-level alignment between the student and teacher models, which restricts the student model's exploration ability, prevent effective use of interactive environment feedback, and suffer from severe memory bottlenecks in reinforcement learning. We introduce On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), a memory-efficient framework that replaces token-level probability matching with trajectory matching using discrete verbal scores (0--9) from teacher models. OVD dramatically reduces memory consumption while enabling on-policy distillation from teacher models with verbal feedback, and avoids token-level alignment, allowing the student model to freely explore the output space. Extensive experiments on Web question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks show that OVD substantially outperforms existing methods, delivering up to +12.9% absolute improvement in average EM on Web Q&A tasks and a up to +25.7% gain on math benchmarks (when trained with only one random samples), while also exhibiting superior training efficiency.

An reinforcement learning-based sampling framework adaptively reweights training datasets to improve embedding model performance while reducing GPU costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 General-purpose open-domain dense retrieval systems are usually trained with a large, eclectic mix of corpora and search tasks. How should these diverse corpora and tasks be sampled for training? Conventional approaches sample them uniformly, proportional to their instance population sizes, or depend on human-level expert supervision. It is well known that the training data sampling strategy can greatly impact model performance. However, how to find the optimal strategy has not been adequately studied in the context of embedding models. We propose Inf-DDS, a novel reinforcement learning driven sampling framework that adaptively reweighs training datasets guided by influence-based reward signals and is much more lightweight with respect to GPU consumption. Our technique iteratively refines the sampling policy, prioritizing datasets that maximize model performance on a target development set. We evaluate the efficacy of our sampling strategy on a wide range of text retrieval tasks, demonstrating strong improvements in retrieval performance and better adaptation compared to existing gradient-based sampling methods, while also being 1.5x to 4x cheaper in GPU compute. Our sampling strategy achieves a 5.03 absolute NDCG@10 improvement while training a multilingual bge-m3 model and an absolute NDCG@10 improvement of 0.94 while training all-MiniLM-L6-v2, even when starting from expert-assigned weights on a large pool of training datasets.

ReSID presents a novel recommendation-native framework that improves sequential recommendation by learning predictive item representations and optimizing quantization for information preservation and sequential predictability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Semantic ID (SID)-based recommendation is a promising paradigm for scaling sequential recommender systems, but existing methods largely follow a semantic-centric pipeline: item embeddings are learned from foundation models and discretized using generic quantization schemes. This design is misaligned with generative recommendation objectives: semantic embeddings are weakly coupled with collaborative prediction, and generic quantization is inefficient at reducing sequential uncertainty for autoregressive modeling. To address these, we propose ReSID, a recommendation-native, principled SID framework that rethinks representation learning and quantization from the perspective of information preservation and sequential predictability, without relying on LLMs. ReSID consists of two components: (i) Field-Aware Masked Auto-Encoding (FAMAE), which learns predictive-sufficient item representations from structured features, and (ii) Globally Aligned Orthogonal Quantization (GAOQ), which produces compact and predictable SID sequences by jointly reducing semantic ambiguity and prefix-conditional uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across ten datasets show the effectiveness of ReSID. ReSID consistently outperforms strong sequential and SID-based generative baselines by an average of over 10%, while reducing tokenization cost by up to 122x.

Scaling hidden states of delimiter tokens in vision-language models reduces cross-image information leakage and improves multi-image reasoning performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on single-image tasks, but their performance declines when multiple images are provided as input. One major reason is the cross-image information leakage, where the model struggles to distinguish information across different images. Existing LVLMs already employ delimiter tokens to mark the start and end of each image, yet our analysis reveals that these tokens fail to effectively block cross-image information leakage. To enhance their effectiveness, we propose a method that scales the hidden states of delimiter tokens. This enhances the model's ability to preserve image-specific information by reinforcing intra-image interaction and limiting undesired cross-image interactions. Consequently, the model is better able to distinguish between images and reason over them more accurately. Experiments show performance gains on multi-image benchmarks such as Mantis, MuirBench, MIRB, and QBench2. We further evaluate our method on text-only tasks that require clear distinction. The method improves performance on multi-document and multi-table understanding benchmarks, including TQABench, MultiNews, and WCEP-10. Notably, our method requires no additional training or inference cost.

Internal flow signatures analyze depthwise dynamics in large language models to enable self-checking and targeted refinement without modifying the base model.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models can generate fluent answers that are unfaithful to the provided context, while many safeguards rely on external verification or a separate judge after generation. We introduce internal flow signatures that audit decision formation from depthwise dynamics at a fixed inter-block monitoring boundary. The method stabilizes token-wise motion via bias-centered monitoring, then summarizes trajectories in compact moving readout-aligned subspaces constructed from the top token and its close competitors within each depth window. Neighboring window frames are aligned by an orthogonal transport, yielding depth-comparable transported step lengths, turning angles, and subspace drift summaries that are invariant to within-window basis choices. A lightweight GRU validator trained on these signatures performs self-checking without modifying the base model. Beyond detection, the validator localizes a culprit depth event and enables a targeted refinement: the model rolls back to the culprit token and clamps an abnormal transported step at the identified block while preserving the orthogonal residual. The resulting pipeline provides actionable localization and low-overhead self-checking from internal decision dynamics.

"Internal flow signatures analyze depthwise dynamics in large language models to enable self-checking and targeted refinement without modifying the base model.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models can generate fluent answers that are unfaithful to the provided context, while many safeguards rely on external verification or a separate judge after generation. We introduce internal flow signatures that audit decision formation from depthwise dynamics at a fixed inter-block monitoring boundary. The method stabilizes token-wise motion via bias-centered monitoring, then summarizes trajectories in compact moving readout-aligned subspaces constructed from the top token and its close competitors within each depth window. Neighboring window frames are aligned by an orthogonal transport, yielding depth-comparable transported step lengths, turning angles, and subspace drift summaries that are invariant to within-window basis choices. A lightweight GRU validator trained on these signatures performs self-checking without modifying the base model. Beyond detection, the validator localizes a culprit depth event and enables a targeted refinement: the model rolls back to the culprit token and clamps an abnormal transported step at the identified block while preserving the orthogonal residual. The resulting pipeline provides actionable localization and low-overhead self-checking from internal decision dynamics. Code is available at github.com/EavnJeong/Internal-Flow-Signatures-for-Self-Checking-and-Refinement-in-LLMs."

Multi-agent systems for molecular discovery that use individualized scientist profiles based on publication and molecular history outperform traditional role-based approaches.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multi-agent systems have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating scientific discovery. To differentiate agent behavior in the multi-agent system, current frameworks typically assign generic role-based personas such as ''reviewer'' or ''writer'' or rely on coarse grained keyword-based personas. While functional, this approach oversimplifies how human scientists operate, whose contributions are shaped by their unique research trajectories. In response, we propose INDIBATOR, a framework for molecular discovery that grounds agents in individualized scientist profiles constructed from two modalities: publication history for literature-derived knowledge and molecular history for structural priors. These agents engage in multi-turn debate through proposal, critique, and voting phases. Our evaluation demonstrates that these fine-grained individuality-grounded agents consistently outperform systems relying on coarse-grained personas, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art performance. These results validate that capturing the ``scientific DNA'' of individual agents is essential for high-quality discovery.

Researchers developed a novel agentic data-generation framework to create culturally grounded safety datasets for Southeast Asia, resulting in multilingual safeguard models that outperform existing approaches in detecting regionally sensitive content while maintaining general safety performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Culturally aware safeguards are crucial for AI alignment in real-world settings, where safety extends beyond common sense and encompasses diverse local values, norms, and region-specific regulations. However, building large-scale, culturally grounded datasets is challenging due to limited resources and a scarcity of native annotators. Consequently, many safeguard models rely on machine translation of English datasets, often missing regional and cultural nuances. We present a novel agentic data-generation framework to scalably create authentic, region-specific safety datasets for Southeast Asia (SEA). On this foundation, we introduce the SEA-Guard family, the first multilingual safeguard models grounded in SEA cultural contexts. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks and cultural variants, SEA-Guard consistently outperforms existing safeguards at detecting regionally sensitive or harmful content while maintaining strong general safety performance.

A two-phase diagnostic framework based on Item Response Theory and Graded Response Model is introduced to assess the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge by examining intrinsic consistency and human alignment.  					AI-generated summary 				 While LLM-as-a-Judge is widely used in automated evaluation, existing validation practices primarily operate at the level of observed outputs, offering limited insight into whether LLM judges themselves function as stable and reliable measurement instruments. To address this limitation, we introduce a two-phase diagnostic framework for assessing reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge, grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT). The framework adopts Graded Response Model (GRM) of IRT and formalizes reliability along two complementary dimensions: (1) intrinsic consistency, defined as the stability of measurement behavior under prompt variations, and (2) human alignment, capturing correspondence with human quality assessments. We empirically examine diverse LLM judges with this framework, and show that leveraging IRT-GRM yields interpretable signals for diagnosing judgments systematically. These signals provide practical guidance for verifying reliablity of LLM-as-a-Judge and identifying potential causes of unreliability.

"A two-phase diagnostic framework based on Item Response Theory and Graded Response Model is introduced to assess the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge by examining intrinsic consistency and human alignment.  					AI-generated summary 				 While LLM-as-a-Judge is widely used in automated evaluation, existing validation practices primarily operate at the level of observed outputs, offering limited insight into whether LLM judges themselves function as stable and reliable measurement instruments. To address this limitation, we introduce a two-phase diagnostic framework for assessing reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge, grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT). The framework adopts Graded Response Model (GRM) of IRT and formalizes reliability along two complementary dimensions: (1) intrinsic consistency, defined as the stability of measurement behavior under prompt variations, and (2) human alignment, capturing correspondence with human quality assessments. We empirically examine diverse LLM judges with this framework, and show that leveraging IRT-GRM yields interpretable signals for diagnosing judgments systematically. These signals provide practical guidance for verifying reliablity of LLM-as-a-Judge and identifying potential causes of unreliability."

Clipping-Free Policy Optimization replaces heuristic clipping with convex quadratic penalty to stabilize reinforcement learning training for large language models without performance loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning has become central to post-training large language models, yet dominant algorithms rely on clipping mechanisms that introduce optimization issues at scale, including zero-gradient regions, reward hacking, and training instability. We propose Clipping-Free Policy Optimization (CFPO), which replaces heuristic clipping with a convex quadratic penalty derived from Total Variation divergence constraints, yielding an everywhere-differentiable objective that enforces stable policy updates without hard boundaries. We evaluate CFPO across both reasoning and alignment settings. In reasoning, CFPO matches clipping-based methods on downstream benchmarks while extending the stable training regime. In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance. CFPO requires only a one-line code change and no additional hyperparameters. Our results suggest that CFPO is a promising drop-in alternative to clipping-based methods for LLM post-training.

Это решение устраняет проблемы масштабирования классических методов, такие как нулевые градиенты, манипулирование наградой и нестабильность обучения. CFPO создает везде дифференцируемую целевую функцию, которая обеспечивает стабильные обновления политики без жестких ограничений. Метод требует только однострочного изменения кода и не вводит дополнительных гиперпараметров, показывая конкурентные результаты как на задачах рассуждения, так и на задачах выравнивания.",
