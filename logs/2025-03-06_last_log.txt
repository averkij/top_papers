INTRODUCTION In an era marked by rapid advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence, enabling robots to perform wide range of complex tasks in dynamically changing environments has emerged as critical challenge. Cognitive robotics strives not only to endow machines with precise control but also to equip them with high-level reasoning and decisionmaking capabilities that allow them to adapt to unpredictable real-world scenarios. Despite notable progress in various domains of robotics, one persistent challenge remains: how to objectively evaluate and compare cognitive robotic systems, particularly when they are expected to tackle multitude of intricate tasks. The scarcity of standardized, open-source benchmarks and datasets is especially evident in the realm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), where existing evaluation frameworks are largely confined to racing or basic navigation tasks. This limitation not only hinders fair comparison among different cognitive UAV systems but also restricts the exThese authors contributed equally to this work.

Skolkovo Institute of Fig. 1. CognitiveDrone is VLA system for UAVs that generates smooth 4D control commands from first-person visual inputs and natural language instructions. It combines 7B-parameter VLA model trained on an extensive open-source dataset of cognitive tasksincluding reasoning, human recognition, and symbol understandingwith 7B-parameter VLM reasoning module that refines task directives. The system is evaluated within CognitiveDroneBenchthe first evaluation benchmark for VLA systems tailored to cognitive UAVswhere the drone must navigate track with gates by selecting the appropriate gate through solving cognitive tasks. We have released the complete dataset, benchmark environment, model weights, and training/inference code as open source. ploration of more sophisticated cognitive functions such as reasoning, human recognition, and symbolic understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce CognitiveDrone novel VLA model designed for real-time cognitive task solving and reasoning in UAVs. In conjunction with the model, we propose CognitiveDroneBench, an open-source benchmark built upon Gazebo-based physical simulation environment that integrates drone racing track with cognitive checkpoints. At each stage of the track, the UAV is required to select specific gates by solving cognitive task, thus providing comprehensive performance evaluation that transcends traditional racing metrics. Furthermore, we augment our system with an auxiliary reasoning module based on the VLM model Qwen2.5VL, yielding the CognitiveDrone-R1 variant. This reasoning module, operating at lower frequency than the primary VLA component, is intended to enhance task comprehension and facilitate more robust decision-making. By seamlessly integrating these components, our work paves the way for more rigorous evaluations and innovative applications in cognitive UAV research. II. RELATED WORKS substantial body of research has focused on developing cognitive systems for robotics, where the integration of visual perception, language understanding, and action planning is paramount. For robotic manipulators, state-of-the-art models such as PaLM-E [1], RT-1 [2], RT-2 [3], and RT-X [4] have significantly advanced the field by incorporating VLA frameworks that enable these robots to handle complex manipulation tasks in dynamic environments. Complementary to these efforts, VLA-based systems like OpenVLA [5], MiniVLA [6], and Octo [7] have been developed for diverse robotic platforms, extending the application spectrum of cognitive robotics. The evaluation of such systems has been further supported by simulation benchmarks. For instance, LIBERO [8] provides simulation environment that standardizes the assessment of cognitive performance in robotic manipulators. In parallel, for robots aimed at human-robot collaboration and domestic assistance including humanoids such as Tesla Optimus, Agility Robotics [9], and FIGURE, as well as quadrupedal platforms like CognitiveDog [10] and DoggyBot [11] the open-source PARTNR benchmark [12] has been introduced to facilitate objective comparisons. Within the realm of cognitive UAVs, various transformerbased and VLA approaches have been explored. UAVs Meet LLMs [13] presents comprehensive overview of such methods, highlighting applications in drone navigation [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], flight control [19], [20], and mission planning [21], [22].

Recent advancements in generative AI have led to the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering, addressing numerous long-standing challenges. However, a comprehensive study examining the capabilities of LLMs in software vulnerability detection (SVD), a crucial aspect of software security, is currently lacking. Existing research primarily focuses on evaluating LLMs using C/C++ datasets. It typically explores only one or two strategies among prompt engineering, instruction tuning, and sequence classification fine-tuning for open-source LLMs. Consequently, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding the effectiveness of diverse LLMs in detecting vulnerabilities across various programming languages. To address this knowledge gap, we present a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the performance of LLMs on the SVD task. We have compiled a comprehensive dataset comprising 8,260 vulnerable functions in Python, 7,505 in Java, and 28,983 in JavaScript. We assess five open-source LLMs using multiple approaches, including prompt engineering, instruction tuning, and sequence classification fine-tuning. These LLMs are benchmarked against five fine-tuned small language models and two open-source static application security testing tools. Furthermore, we explore two avenues to improve LLM performance on SVD: a) Data perspective: Retraining models using downsampled balanced datasets. b) Model perspective: Investigating ensemble learning methods that combine predictions from multiple LLMs. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SVD remains a challenging task for LLMs. This study provides a thorough understanding of the role of LLMs in SVD and offers practical insights for future advancements in leveraging generative AI to enhance software security practices.

This paper introduces CognitiveDrone, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model tailored for complex Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) tasks that demand advanced cognitive abilities. Trained on a dataset comprising over 8,000 simulated flight trajectories across three key categories-Human Recognition, Symbol Understanding, and Reasoning-the model generates real-time 4D action commands based on first-person visual inputs and textual instructions. To further enhance performance in intricate scenarios, we propose CognitiveDrone-R1, which integrates an additional Vision-Language Model (VLM) reasoning module to simplify task directives prior to high-frequency control. Experimental evaluations using our open-source benchmark, CognitiveDroneBench, reveal that while a racing-oriented model (RaceVLA) achieves an overall success rate of 31.3%, the base CognitiveDrone model reaches 59.6%, and CognitiveDrone-R1 attains a success rate of 77.2%. These results demonstrate improvements of up to 30% in critical cognitive tasks, underscoring the effectiveness of incorporating advanced reasoning capabilities into UAV control systems. Our contributions include the development of a state-of-the-art VLA model for UAV control and the introduction of the first dedicated benchmark for assessing cognitive tasks in drone operations.

In Switzerland legal translation is uniquely important due to the country's four official languages and requirements for multilingual legal documentation. However, this process traditionally relies on professionals who must be both legal experts and skilled translators -- creating bottlenecks and impacting effective access to justice. To address this challenge, we introduce SwiLTra-Bench, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark of over 180K aligned Swiss legal translation pairs comprising laws, headnotes, and press releases across all Swiss languages along with English, designed to evaluate LLM-based translation systems. Our systematic evaluation reveals that frontier models achieve superior translation performance across all document types, while specialized translation systems excel specifically in laws but under-perform in headnotes. Through rigorous testing and human expert validation, we demonstrate that while fine-tuning open SLMs significantly improves their translation quality, they still lag behind the best zero-shot prompted frontier models such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Additionally, we present SwiLTra-Judge, a specialized LLM evaluation system that aligns best with human expert assessments.
