INTRODUCTION Recent advances in robot learning have significantly enhanced the autonomy and capability of robotic manipulation systems [1], [2], [3]. Large-scale datasets of interaction data collected across different institutions have played crucial role in enabling robots to learn from extensive demonstrations and refine their skills through imitation and reinforcement learning [4], [5], [6], [7]. However, as these datasets grow with data coming from real-world applications such as domestic environments, data privacy and decentralized learning become critical concerns [8], [9]. In this context, training manipulation policies in distributed, privacy-preserving manner remains largely unexplored. Traditional methods for learning manipulation policies from large-scale datasets rely on centralized training [1], [3], [10], [11], where behavioral model is trained iteratively over an entire dataset stored in centralized manner (illustrated in Fig.1, top). However, we envision paradigm shift where robots continuously acquire knowledge from their own experiences in situated, diverse, real-world environments and collaboratively update global policy model, while keeping their experience data local and private (Fig.1, bottom). Such an approach, termed federated learning (FL) [12], allows distributed robots to contribute to shared model without centralizing sensitive data. Instead of learning from static datasets, robots could dynamically improve their manipulation policies by leveraging experiences across multiple settings, leading to more adaptive and resilient behaviors. While federated learning has gained traction in robotics, *Equal Contribution, 1All authors are with KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden sbb, albertal, miguelsv, yuchongz, dani@kth.se Fig. 1: Learning manipulation policies through federated learning. In centralized training (top), global model is trained iteratively over large dataset stored in central server. In contrast, federated learning (bottom) enables distributed robots to locally train models on their own data and periodically share updates with central server, preserving data privacy. In this work, we contribute FLAME, the first benchmark of federated learning for robotic manipulation. particularly in mobile robot navigation [13], [14] and object grasping [15], there remains notable gap: no standardized benchmarks exist to evaluate FL frameworks specifically for robotic systems, and robotic manipulation in particular has yet to be explored through the lens of federated learning. To address this gap, we introduce FLAME (Federated Learning Across Manipulation Environments), benchmark designed to evaluate federated learning strategies for robotic manipulation tasks. Our benchmark provides set of largescale datasets of diverse manipulation tasks collected across multiple settings, incorporating variations in lighting conditions, textures, object appearances, and camera viewpoints, encompassing over 15M data samples. Furthermore, FLAME integrates these distributed datasets into FL framework, enabling rigorous evaluation of FL algorithms and serving as foundation for developing more robust federated learning manipulation strategies. We employ our proposed benchmark to evaluate different federated learning baselines across diverse set of environments and four different manipulation tasks. Our results highlight the potential of federated learning as scalable and privacy-preserving strategy for robotic manipulation, paving the way for real-world deployment and the continual learning of adaptive robotic systems. In summary, our contributions are as follows: FLAME, federated learning benchmark for robotic manipulation, consisting of large-scale dataset collected across multiple simulated environments and tasks, and federated learning and evaluation framework designed for robotic manipulation. rigorous evaluation of different federated learning baselines, demonstrating the need for more research for federated approaches for robotic manipulation training in distributed setting. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first application of federated learning to robotic manipulation strategies. We believe our benchmark will serve as valuable resource for the robotics and machine learning communities, fostering advancements in robotic manipulation. The code and datasets of FLAME will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper. II. RELATED WORK A. Federated Learning Benchmarks Federated Learning is machine learning paradigm that advocates for the distributed training of local models to learn global model by aggregating locally-computed updates [12]. The best aggregation strategy is an active area of research [16], [17], [18], [19]. The emergence of federated learning has spurred the creation of diverse benchmarks such as FedScale [20], FLBench [21], FedLLM-Bench [22], and LEAF [23] to evaluate FL methods on text, image, speech, or preference data. Despite covering different learning tasks, such as text and image classification [23], [21], medical analysis [24], and instruction tuning [22], these benchmarks focus exclusively on domains outside robotics"

Tool learning aims to augment large language models (LLMs) with diverse tools, enabling them to act as agents for solving practical tasks. Due to the limited context length of tool-using LLMs, adopting information retrieval (IR) models to select useful tools from large toolsets is a critical initial step. However, the performance of IR models in tool retrieval tasks remains underexplored and unclear. Most tool-use benchmarks simplify this step by manually pre-annotating a small set of relevant tools for each task, which is far from the real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ToolRet, a heterogeneous tool retrieval benchmark comprising 7.6k diverse retrieval tasks, and a corpus of 43k tools, collected from existing datasets. We benchmark six types of models on ToolRet. Surprisingly, even the models with strong performance in conventional IR benchmarks, exhibit poor performance on ToolRet. This low retrieval quality degrades the task pass rate of tool-use LLMs. As a further step, we contribute a large-scale training dataset with over 200k instances, which substantially optimizes the tool retrieval ability of IR models.

Due to the limited context length of tool-using LLMs, adopting information retrieval (IR) models to select useful tools from large toolsets is a critical initial step. However, the performance of IR models in tool retrieval tasks remains underexplored and unclear. Most tool-use benchmarks simplify this step by manually pre-annotating a small set of relevant tools for each task, which is far from the real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ToolRet, a heterogeneous tool retrieval benchmark comprising 7.6k diverse retrieval tasks, and a corpus of 43k tools, collected from existing datasets. We benchmark six types of models on ToolRet. Surprisingly, even the models with strong performance in conventional IR benchmarks, exhibit poor performance on ToolRet. This low retrieval quality degrades the task pass rate of tool-use LLMs. As a further step, we contribute a large-scale training dataset with over 200k instances, which substantially optimizes the tool retrieval ability of IR models."

Recent progress in robotic manipulation has been fueled by large-scale datasets collected across diverse environments. Training robotic manipulation policies on these datasets is traditionally performed in a centralized manner, raising concerns regarding scalability, adaptability, and data privacy. While federated learning enables decentralized, privacy-preserving training, its application to robotic manipulation remains largely unexplored. We introduce FLAME (Federated Learning Across Manipulation Environments), the first benchmark designed for federated learning in robotic manipulation. FLAME consists of: (i) a set of large-scale datasets of over 160,000 expert demonstrations of multiple manipulation tasks, collected across a wide range of simulated environments; (ii) a training and evaluation framework for robotic policy learning in a federated setting. We evaluate standard federated learning algorithms in FLAME, showing their potential for distributed policy learning and highlighting key challenges. Our benchmark establishes a foundation for scalable, adaptive, and privacy-aware robotic learning.

Recent advancements in generative AI have led to the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering, addressing numerous long-standing challenges. However, a comprehensive study examining the capabilities of LLMs in software vulnerability detection (SVD), a crucial aspect of software security, is currently lacking. Existing research primarily focuses on evaluating LLMs using C/C++ datasets. It typically explores only one or two strategies among prompt engineering, instruction tuning, and sequence classification fine-tuning for open-source LLMs. Consequently, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding the effectiveness of diverse LLMs in detecting vulnerabilities across various programming languages. To address this knowledge gap, we present a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the performance of LLMs on the SVD task. We have compiled a comprehensive dataset comprising 8,260 vulnerable functions in Python, 7,505 in Java, and 28,983 in JavaScript. We assess five open-source LLMs using multiple approaches, including prompt engineering, instruction tuning, and sequence classification fine-tuning. These LLMs are benchmarked against five fine-tuned small language models and two open-source static application security testing tools. Furthermore, we explore two avenues to improve LLM performance on SVD: a) Data perspective: Retraining models using downsampled balanced datasets. b) Model perspective: Investigating ensemble learning methods that combine predictions from multiple LLMs. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SVD remains a challenging task for LLMs. This study provides a thorough understanding of the role of LLMs in SVD and offers practical insights for future advancements in leveraging generative AI to enhance software security practices.

This paper introduces CognitiveDrone, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model tailored for complex Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) tasks that demand advanced cognitive abilities. Trained on a dataset comprising over 8,000 simulated flight trajectories across three key categories-Human Recognition, Symbol Understanding, and Reasoning-the model generates real-time 4D action commands based on first-person visual inputs and textual instructions. To further enhance performance in intricate scenarios, we propose CognitiveDrone-R1, which integrates an additional Vision-Language Model (VLM) reasoning module to simplify task directives prior to high-frequency control. Experimental evaluations using our open-source benchmark, CognitiveDroneBench, reveal that while a racing-oriented model (RaceVLA) achieves an overall success rate of 31.3%, the base CognitiveDrone model reaches 59.6%, and CognitiveDrone-R1 attains a success rate of 77.2%. These results demonstrate improvements of up to 30% in critical cognitive tasks, underscoring the effectiveness of incorporating advanced reasoning capabilities into UAV control systems. Our contributions include the development of a state-of-the-art VLA model for UAV control and the introduction of the first dedicated benchmark for assessing cognitive tasks in drone operations.

"This paper introduces CognitiveDrone, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model tailored for complex Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) tasks that demand advanced cognitive abilities. Trained on a dataset comprising over 8,000 simulated flight trajectories across three key categories-Human Recognition, Symbol Understanding, and Reasoning-the model generates real-time 4D action commands based on first-person visual inputs and textual instructions. To further enhance performance in intricate scenarios, we propose CognitiveDrone-R1, which integrates an additional Vision-Language Model (VLM) reasoning module to simplify task directives prior to high-frequency control. Experimental evaluations using our open-source benchmark, CognitiveDroneBench, reveal that while a racing-oriented model (RaceVLA) achieves an overall success rate of 31.3%, the base CognitiveDrone model reaches 59.6%, and CognitiveDrone-R1 attains a success rate of 77.2%. These results demonstrate improvements of up to 30% in critical cognitive tasks, underscoring the effectiveness of incorporating advanced reasoning capabilities into UAV control systems. Our contributions include the development of a state-of-the-art VLA model for UAV control and the introduction of the first dedicated benchmark for assessing cognitive tasks in drone operations.

In Switzerland legal translation is uniquely important due to the country's four official languages and requirements for multilingual legal documentation. However, this process traditionally relies on professionals who must be both legal experts and skilled translators -- creating bottlenecks and impacting effective access to justice. To address this challenge, we introduce SwiLTra-Bench, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark of over 180K aligned Swiss legal translation pairs comprising laws, headnotes, and press releases across all Swiss languages along with English, designed to evaluate LLM-based translation systems. Our systematic evaluation reveals that frontier models achieve superior translation performance across all document types, while specialized translation systems excel specifically in laws but under-perform in headnotes. Through rigorous testing and human expert validation, we demonstrate that while fine-tuning open SLMs significantly improves their translation quality, they still lag behind the best zero-shot prompted frontier models such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Additionally, we present SwiLTra-Judge, a specialized LLM evaluation system that aligns best with human expert assessments.
