However, aligning LLMs remains challenging due to the inherent disconnect between the complexity of human values and the narrow nature of the technological approaches designed to address them. Current alignment methods often lead to misspecified objectives, reflecting the broader issue of incomplete contracts, the impracticality of specifying contract between model developer, and the model that accounts for every scenario in LLM alignment. In this paper, we argue that improving LLM alignment requires incorporating insights from societal alignment frameworks, including social, economic, and contractual alignment, and discuss potential solutions drawn from these domains. Given the role of uncertainty within societal alignment frameworks, we then investigate how it manifests in LLM alignment. We end our discussion by offering an alternative view on LLM alignment, framing the under-specified nature of its objectives as an opportunity rather than perfect their specification. Beyond technical improvements in LLM alignment, we discuss the need for participatory alignment interface designs. 1.

Correspondence to: Karolina Stanczak <karolina.stanczak@mila.quebec>. 1 aligning their behavior with human values has become critical challenge to ensuring their usability in real-world applications (Leike et al., 2018; Gabriel, 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2023). This alignment encompasses both explicit values, such as following instructions and being helpful, and implicit values, such as remaining truthful and avoiding biased or otherwise harmful outputs (Askell et al., 2021). In fact, the rise of LLM-based chat assistants has largely been driven by their ability to follow instructions and engage in open-ended dialogue, demonstrating the importance of alignment, enabled by algorithms such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF; Ouyang et al. 2022; Ziegler et al. 2020). Despite these advancements, aligning LLMs with human values remains formidable challenge (Wei et al., 2023; Williams et al., 2024; Greenblatt et al., 2024). This difficulty primarily stems from the fundamental gap between the intricacies of human values and the often narrow technological solutions (Hadfield-Menell & Hadfield, 2019). Current LLM alignment methods, such as RLHF, often result in misspecified alignment objectives, where reward functions reflect human values only within designer (or annotators) provided scenarios, finite set among an infinite set of values, failing to generalize in unforeseen contexts (Amodei et al., 2016; Hadfield-Menell & Hadfield, 2019; Turner et al., 2020; 2021; Skalse et al., 2024). While developers acknowledge the problem of misspecification (Leike et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022), the root causes of this issue have been largely overlooked. To better understand this misalignment, we frame LLM alignment within principal-agent1 framework (Eisenhardt, 1989), well-established paradigm in economic theory. As shown in Figure 1, in this framework, the LLM acts as the agent and the model developer (or user) serves as the principal. We define contract as pair: an action taken by the agent and the corresponding reward assigned by the principal. For example, contract in LLM training 1We use agent in the contract theory sense, referring to an entity acting on behalf of principal, rather than the broader AI notion of autonomous systems. Societal Alignment Frameworks Can Improve LLM Alignment Figure 1. We view human-LLM interactions as principal-agent framework, where principal (a system designer) incentivizes an agent (an LLM) to take an action by offering reward r. This framework assumes that the agents action is driven by its reward function, forming pair (a, r) that serves as contract between the agent and the principal. However, this contract is incomplete. To address this incompleteness, we explore societal alignment mechanisms of social, economic, and contractual alignment as guiding principles for LLM alignment in the incomplete contracting environment. could reward the model for generating responses that follow factual accuracy constraints while penalizing hallucinated outputs. The principal is able to steer the agents behavior toward intended objectives with an appropriate reward. In an ideal scenario, complete contract would perfectly align the agents actions with the principals objectives in all possible states of the world. However, designing fully specified contract that anticipates every possible scenario in model training is infeasible (Hadfield-Menell & Hadfield, 2019; Zhuang & HadfieldIn LLM alignment, this challenge is reMenell, 2020). flected in the reward function, which is derived from explicitly elicited values or implicitly implied values in the form of human preferences. Yet, quantifying complex and often diverging human values is difficult (Leike et al., 2018; Feffer et al., 2023), and capturing them effectively incurs high annotation costs (Klingefjord et al., 2024). Aggregating these values into unified reward signal is nontrivial (Kemmer et al., 2020; Ilvento, 2020). These alignment challenges are not unique to LLMs. In fact, they echo broader alignment problems that humans encounter daily due to incomplete contracts. Institutions such as society, economy, and law enable us to thrive despite incompleteness. In this position piece, we advocate for leveraging insights from societal alignment frameworks to guide the development of LLM alignment within incomplete contracting environ"

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on producing responses that meet human expectations and align with shared values - a process coined alignment. However, aligning LLMs remains challenging due to the inherent disconnect between the complexity of human values and the narrow nature of the technological approaches designed to address them. Current alignment methods often lead to misspecified objectives, reflecting the broader issue of incomplete contracts, the impracticality of specifying a contract between a model developer, and the model that accounts for every scenario in LLM alignment. In this paper, we argue that improving LLM alignment requires incorporating insights from societal alignment frameworks, including social, economic, and contractual alignment, and discuss potential solutions drawn from these domains. Given the role of uncertainty within societal alignment frameworks, we then investigate how it manifests in LLM alignment. We end our discussion by offering an alternative view on LLM alignment, framing the underspecified nature of its objectives as an opportunity rather than perfect their specification. Beyond technical improvements in LLM alignment, we discuss the need for participatory alignment interface designs.
