Text:"Remasking Discrete Diffusion Models with Inference-Time Scaling Guanghan Wang * 1 Yair Schiff * 1 Subham Sekhar Sahoo 1 Volodymyr Kuleshov 1 5 2 0 2 1 ] . [ 1 7 0 3 0 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r aPart of the success of diffusion models stems from their ability to perform iterative refinement, i.e., repeatedly correcting outputs during generation. However, modern masked discrete diffusion lacks this capability: when token is generated, it cannot be updated again, even when it introduces an error. Here, we address this limitation by introducing the remasking diffusion model (ReMDM) sampler, method that can be applied to pretrained masked diffusion models in principled way and that is derived from discrete diffusion model with custom remasking backward process. Most interestingly, ReMDM endows discrete diffusion with form of inferencetime compute scaling. By increasing the number of sampling steps, ReMDM generates natural language outputs that approach the quality of autoregressive models, whereas when the computation budget is limited, ReMDM better maintains quality. ReMDM also improves sample quality of masked diffusion models for discretized images, and in scientific domains such as molecule design, ReMDM facilitates diffusion guidance and pushes the Pareto frontier of controllability relative to classical masking and uniform noise diffusion. We provide the code along with blog post on the project page: https://remdm.github.io 1. Introduction Diffusion models have gained significant traction as algorithms for generating high-quality images and videos (SohlDickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020). Part of the success of diffusion stems from its ability to perform iterative refinementrepeatedly modifying outputs and fixing errors over multiple steps of generationwhich makes diffusion models especially effective at guided generation (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Ho & Salimans, 2022), *Equal contribution 1Department of Computer Science, Cornell Unversity. Correspondence to: Guanghan Wang <guanghanwang5@gmail.com>. 1 fast sampling (Song et al., 2020a; Salimans & Ho, 2022; Song et al., 2023), and supports inference-time scaling to improve sample quality (Ma et al., 2025). Discrete counterparts of diffusion models (Austin et al., 2021) have also been steadily improving in quality on tasks such as language modeling and biological sequence design (Lou et al., 2024; Sahoo et al., 2024; Schiff et al., 2024). However, modern discrete diffusionespecially the most performant kind that relies on masking (Ou et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024; Sahoo et al., 2024)lacks the fundamental ability to iteratively refine outputs. Once discrete token is unmasked, it cannot be updated again, even if it introduces an error. The lack of error correction in turn sets limits on controllable generation, sampling speed, and sample quality. Here, we address the inability of masked diffusion models to perform iterative refinement by introducing new sampler that supports remasking during generation. Our method, the remasking diffusion model (ReMDM) sampler, is simple and allows users to directly specify the probability of remasking token at each time step. We augment the sampler with components that range from nucleus sampling to remasking schedules, significantly boosting performance. Our approach for deriving the sampler is rooted in probabilistic modeling-we show that our method corresponds to ancestral sampling in discrete diffusion model (also called ReMDM) characterized by remasking backward process. The ReMDM model admits an objective that is rescaled version of the MDLM objective (Sahoo et al., 2024)this suggests using the ReMDM sampler on top of pre-trained MDLMs, which we find to work well. We complement our analysis of the sampler by also showing that it can be interpreted as predictor-corrector technique (Song et al., 2020b; Campbell et al., 2022). Most interestingly, the ReMDM sampler endows discrete diffusion with form of inference-time compute scaling. By increasing the number of denoising steps on language modeling tasks, ReMDM generates samples with significantly higher sample quality metrics than any previous diffusion model and almost matches the performance of an autoregressive (AR) model with the same architecture. Conversely, when we reduce sampling steps to increase speed, performance degrades less than other samplers on text and image generation. Lastly, ReMDM models are more amenable Remasking Discrete Diffusion Models with Inference-Time Scaling Figure 1. Our family of masked diffusion processes allow for more flexible generation with remasking of already decoded tokens. This improves sample quality and further closes the gap to AR models. (Left) An illustrative example of errors fixed by ReMDM. The first two tokens can be They sell or She sells, but due to the independence of the parallelized decoding processes, She sell is decoded. Such mistakes can be corrected by remasking samplers. (Right) MAUVE scores on OpenWebText. MDLM is from Sahoo et al. (2024). FB and DFM denote the forward-backward (Campbell et al., 2022) and discrete flow matching (Gat et al., 2024) correctors, respectively. to guidance (Schiff et al., 2024)in molecule design experiments, ReMDM pushes the Pareto frontier of novelty and the desired molecular property relative to alternatives relying on masking or uniform noise diffusion. Contributions We summarize our contributions as follows: 1. We introduce the remasking diffusion model (ReMDM) sampler and number of add-on components that bring performant iterative refinement via remasking to masked diffusion models. 2. We show that our method is form of ancestral sampling in probabilistic model whose ELBO is similar to that of classical masked diffusion. This analysis suggests using our sampler on top of pre-trained models, which we find to work well. 3. Across the domains of natural language, discretized images, and molecule string representations, we demonstrate empirically that ReMDM endows masked diffusion with inference-time scaling that improves sample quality with more computation, and that also enhances controlled generation.

Part of the success of diffusion models stems from their ability to perform iterative refinement, i.e., repeatedly correcting outputs during generation. However, modern masked discrete diffusion lacks this capability: when a token is generated, it cannot be updated again, even when it introduces an error. Here, we address this limitation by introducing the remasking diffusion model (ReMDM) sampler, a method that can be applied to pretrained masked diffusion models in a principled way and that is derived from a discrete diffusion model with a custom remasking backward process. Most interestingly, ReMDM endows discrete diffusion with a form of inference-time compute scaling. By increasing the number of sampling steps, ReMDM generates natural language outputs that approach the quality of autoregressive models, whereas when the computation budget is limited, ReMDM better maintains quality. ReMDM also improves sample quality of masked diffusion models for discretized images, and in scientific domains such as molecule design, ReMDM facilitates diffusion guidance and pushes the Pareto frontier of controllability relative to classical masking and uniform noise diffusion. We provide the code along with a blog post on the project page: https://remdm.github.io.

Этот подход повышает качество генерации естественного языка, приближая его к уровню авторегрессионных моделей, особенно при увеличении числа шагов сэмплирования. ReMDM также демонстрирует улучшения в генерации дискретизированных изображений и дизайне молекул.",
