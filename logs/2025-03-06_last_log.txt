INTRODUCTION Multi-agent coordination is essential to ensure that fleet of robots can navigate shared spaces, such as warehouse floors [33] and public roads [1]. Effective coordination avoids collisions, reduces delays, and optimizes resource usage. Coordination between robots can either be achieved implicitly by each robot acting to avoid conflicts based on its local information, or explicitly via distributed or centralized decision-making. The former category of methods implies pre-determined mutual understanding between robots (e.g. set of rules or reciprocal policies). Their myopic nature is ill-suited for solving complex scenarios with many agents. The latter methods can plan ahead to optimize fleet operation, allowing robots to achieve common goals safely and efficiently in challenging settings. However, existing explicit coordination methods face fundamental trade-off between optimality and computational tractability, particularly as the number of robots increases or the task objectives become more complex. While heuristicbased methods [9] and sampling-based methods [27] are fast in computation, they often struggle to provide high-quality *This research was done during Yues internship at Amazon.

Email: {majcherc,liuwll,skkiesel,fpecora}@amazon.com solutions for large graphs and require carefully crafted designs tailored to specific objectives. On the other hand, exact methods such as optimization-based approaches [22] and search-based methods [23] can deliver better quality results, but their exponential complexity makes them impractical for large-scale problems. In light of the recent advances in deep generative models [21], we leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to learn the distribution of the high-quality solutions for multi-agent coordination problems. This approach offers several key advantages: (i) GNN are well-suited for embedding the inherent graphical structure of multi-agent coordination problems, enabling them to capture complex interactions among robots. (ii) VAE incorporate uncertainties in the problem, opening the possibility to generate multiple candidate solutions. (iii) Neural Networks are efficient in evaluation, leveraging GPU parallel computation for faster performance, and (iv) deep generative models based on graphs can generalize effectively to larger-scale problems. In this paper, we propose GNN-VAE based framework to achieve reliable and efficient multi-agent coordination. Framing the multi-agent coordination problem as an optimization problem on graph, we collect optimal solutions using Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) solver. During training, the GNN-VAE encodes these solutions into latent space. At the inference stage, latent embeddings are sampled from the latent space and are further decoded to the solution samples, with the solution sample having the lowest cost selected for the coordination problem. Rather than predicting pure solution labels, GNN-VAE learns node ranks and edge modes in semi-supervised manner to construct the solution, ensuring the prediction satisfies formal constraints of the coordination problem. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: 1) We propose novel learning framework that utilizes GNN-VAEs to tackle the particular application of multi-agent navigation in shared space, leveraging the generative nature of the model to sample from the set of feasible problem solutions. 2) We propose two-branch learning framework that guarantees, by construction, the satisfaction of two types of constraints of the coordination problem when inferring solutions. 3) We perform an extensive evaluation of our approach, benchmarking it against strong baselines for problems involving up to 250 robots. II. RELATED WORK This paper considers centralized, explicit coordination problems, which belong to resource-constrained project scheduling problems (RCPSP) [29] known to be NPhard [2]. Related work can be divided into heuristic-based methods [6], optimization-based methods [22], search-based methods [23] and sampling-based methods [34]. An extensive comparison in [30] shows that meta-heuristic methods such as Tabu search outperforms other algorithms, and optimization-based methods work well on small-scale problems. Our approach does not require handcrafted heuristics designs, nor does it require time-consuming search or optimization processes. Instead, our method is akin to the sampling-based methods as it learns the underlying solution distribution from the demonstrated data, enabling it to scale and generalize to large-scale unseen scenarios.

INTRODUCTIONsimulators and studying intelligent systems such as autonomous driving and warehouse ground robots [1], [2]. To close the sim-to-real gap for the agents, is critical to model the uncertainty and rule adherence properties that naturally arise from human behaviors. For example, human drivers have different characteristics (aggressiveness, conservativeness), which affect their decision-making in challenging scenarios (e.g., going through roundabout with dense traffic). Besides, low-level driving commands (steering the wheel, accelerating, braking) are also driven by high-level maneuvers lane-changing) and traffic rules (e.g., speed (lane-keeping, it Manuscript received: March 26, 2024; Revised: June 22, 2024; Accepted: July 31, 2024.

However, driving simulators up-to-date [3], [4] still struggle in delivering diverse and rule-compliance agent behaviors. They either use recorded trajectories or utilize rule-based or imitation-based methods to generate policy. Rule-based approaches (IDM [5], MOBIL [6]) directly encode rules into mathematical models thus can provide safety and goalreaching performance. Still, they assume simplified driving scenarios and require careful parameter tuning, lacking diversity and realisticness. Imitation-based methods [7], [8] learn from real-world driving data, being more akin to human behaviors, but are prone to violate the rules. Besides, since there is only one outcome (out of many possible future trajectories) per scene in the ground truth, only limited diversity is achieved by these imitation-based approaches [9]. Impeding the advancement of learning realistic behaviors are three challenges: (1) flexible rule representation, (2) the scarcity of multiple-outcome datasets, and (3) the trade-off between rule compliance and diversity. Our paper systematically addresses these problems by leveraging formal language termed Signal Temporal Logic (STL) [10], [11]. STL is known for modeling complicated rules [12], and there are increasing works recently studying controller synthesis under STL specifications via trajectory optimization [13], deep learning [14], [15] and reinforcement learning [16]. Inspired by these works and recent breakthroughs in diffusion models [17] for policy learning [18], we proposed parametric-STL approach to flexibly encode traffic rules, augment the dataset, and learn controllable diffusion policy to balance quality and diversity1. The whole pipeline is: We first specify rules via parameterSTL and use demonstrations to calibrate the parameters. The parameters involve both discrete and continuous values, adding the capacity to form multi-modal and diverse policy distributions. Based on the STL, the parameters, and the original data, we generate the multiple-outcome data via trajectory optimization. Next, we use Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM [17]) to learn from the augmented data. Finally, different from other diffusion-based policies [18], [19], an additional neural network is designed to regulate the trajectories to be rule-compliant and diverse. We conduct experiments on NuScenes [20], large-scale autonomous driving dataset. We first label the dataset using our annotation tool and generate the augmented dataset. Then we train our approach on the augmented dataset and evaluate on the validation set and in closed-loop testing. Our approach 1Diversity refers to generate different trajectories for the same STL rule. IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS. PREPRINT VERSION. ACCEPTED JULY 2024 results in the highest STL satisfaction rate on the validation set and generates the most diverse trajectories compared to baselines. In closed-loop testing, our approach reaches the highest overall performance regarding diversity, STL satisfaction, collision, out-of-lane, and progress. We also show that with varied STL parameters, our approach can reflect different driver characteristics in challenging roundabout scenario, which is valuable for diverse behavior modeling in simulators. case study on human-robot encounter scenarios "

Multi-agent coordination is crucial for reliable multi-robot navigation in shared spaces such as automated warehouses. In regions of dense robot traffic, local coordination methods may fail to find a deadlock-free solution. In these scenarios, it is appropriate to let a central unit generate a global schedule that decides the passing order of robots. However, the runtime of such centralized coordination methods increases significantly with the problem scale. In this paper, we propose to leverage Graph Neural Network Variational Autoencoders (GNN-VAE) to solve the multi-agent coordination problem at scale faster than through centralized optimization. We formulate the coordination problem as a graph problem and collect ground truth data using a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) solver. During training, our learning framework encodes good quality solutions of the graph problem into a latent space. At inference time, solution samples are decoded from the sampled latent variables, and the lowest-cost sample is selected for coordination. Finally, the feasible proposal with the highest performance index is selected for the deployment. By construction, our GNN-VAE framework returns solutions that always respect the constraints of the considered coordination problem. Numerical results show that our approach trained on small-scale problems can achieve high-quality solutions even for large-scale problems with 250 robots, being much faster than other baselines.

Generating realistic simulations is critical for autonomous system applications such as self-driving and human-robot interactions. However, driving simulators nowadays still have difficulty in generating controllable, diverse, and rule-compliant behaviors for road participants: Rule-based models cannot produce diverse behaviors and require careful tuning, whereas learning-based methods imitate the policy from data but are not designed to follow the rules explicitly. Besides, the real-world datasets are by nature "single-outcome", making the learning method hard to generate diverse behaviors. In this paper, we leverage Signal Temporal Logic (STL) and Diffusion Models to learn controllable, diverse, and rule-aware policy. We first calibrate the STL on the real-world data, then generate diverse synthetic data using trajectory optimization, and finally learn the rectified diffusion policy on the augmented dataset. We test on the NuScenes dataset and our approach can achieve the most diverse rule-compliant trajectories compared to other baselines, with a runtime 1/17X to the second-best approach. In the closed-loop testing, our approach reaches the highest diversity, rule satisfaction rate, and the least collision rate. Our method can generate varied characteristics conditional on different STL parameters in testing. A case study on human-robot encounter scenarios shows our approach can generate diverse and closed-to-oracle trajectories. The annotation tool, augmented dataset, and code are available at https://github.com/mengyuest/pSTL-diffusion-policy.

Авторы используют комбинацию Сигнальной Темпоральной Логики (STL) и Диффузионных Моделей для создания контролируемой, разнообразной и соблюдающей правила политики поведения участников дорожного движения. Метод сначала калибрует STL на реальных данных, затем генерирует разнообразные синтетические данные с помощью оптимизации траекторий, и наконец обучает скорректированную диффузионную политику на расширенном наборе данных. Результаты показывают, что подход превосходит базовые методы по разнообразию, соблюдению правил и безопасности, а также позволяет генерировать различные характеристики в зависимости от параметров STL.",
