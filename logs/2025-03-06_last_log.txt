Text:"ABC: Achieving Better Control of Multimodal Embeddings using VLMs Benjamin Schneider 1 2 Florian Kerschbaum 1 Wenhu Chen 1 2 https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/ABC/Visual embedding models excel at zero-shot tasks like visual retrieval and classification. However, these models cannot be used for tasks that contain ambiguity or require user instruction. These tasks necessitate multimodal embedding model, which outputs embeddings that combine visual and natural language input. Existing CLIP-based approaches embed images and text independently, and fuse the result. We find that this results in weak interactions between modalities, and poor user control over the representation. We introduce ABC, an open-source multimodal embedding model that uses vision-language model backbone to deeply integrate image features with natural language instructions. ABC achieves bestfor-size performance on MSCOCO image-to-text retrieval and is the top performing model on classification and VQA tasks in the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark. With strongly unified vision-language representation, ABC can use natural language to solve subtle and potentially ambiguous visual retrieval problems. To evaluate this capability, we design CtrlBench, benchmark that requires interleaving textual instructions with image content for correct retrieval. ABC advances the state of multimodal embeddings by offering high-quality representations and flexible natural language control. Our model and datasets are available at our project page. 5 2 0 2 1 ] . [ 1 9 2 3 0 0 . 3 0 5 2 : r 1. Introduction Visual embeddings have become foundational representation in computer vision. Image embedding models have become the state of the art for many zero-shot tasks, including visual retrieval (Chen et al., 2024) and image classification (Yu et al., 2022). Since the release of CLIP (Radford 1Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo 2Vector Institute, Toronto. Correspondence to: Benjamin Schneider <Benjamin.Schneider@uwaterloo.ca>. Figure 1: An example use case of our model; information retrieval on specific aspects of scene. et al., 2021), its dual encoder architecture has remained the state of the art for producing high-quality visual embeddings (Yu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024). However, CLIP only supports separately embedding images or text (Radford et al., 2021). Therefore, complex visual embedding tasks which require additional specification are impossible. For example, CLIP model cannot distinguish which is the correct answer in Figure 1, as both captions are plausible unless the user provides additional instruction. For such tasks, multimodal embedding, representation that interleaves vision and natural language, is essential. We find that existing approaches suffer from two problems: (1) Vague and repetitive instructions. During training the same instructions are repeated and reused, which results in instruction overfitting (Gudibande et al., 2023). (2) Weak interaction between modalities. Previous works fuse embeddings outputted by CLIP models (Zhang et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2023). This approach prevents deeper interaction between modalities, resulting in superficial use of the instructions (Jiang et al., 2024b). To this end, we introduce ABC, model that uses user instruction to control multimodal embeddings. ABCs visionlanguage model (VLM) backbone allows it to integrate natural language instructions when crafting visual embeddings. We find that training our model has two fundamental challenges: (1) Extracting useful contrastive embeddings from 1 ABC: Achieving Better Control of Multimodal Embeddings using VLMs Figure 2: An overview of our training regime. We use negative mining to augment our pretraining dataset with almost plausible text negatives for each image query. In our instruction finetuning stage, we craft multiple instructions from each image. We use multiple for captions for same image as negatives, the model must use the natural language instruction to choose the best (positive) text candidate for the query. pretrained generative VLM. (2) Designing an instruction fine-tuning method that lets users modify multimodal embeddings using natural language instructions. To train ABC, we adopt multi-stage training process. In the initial pretraining stage, we use contrastive training with carefully selected negatives to develop model that generates embeddings, similar to CLIP. In the second stage, we train lightweight adapter using synthetic natural language instructions that correspond to different aspects of the same image. This training process results in model that produces powerful and flexible multimodal embeddings. ABC achieves impressive zero-shot performance in retrieval, classification, and visual question answering (VQA) tasks. In MSCOCO (Lin et al., 2015) image-to-text retrieval, our model outperforms all CLIP models containing at most 8 billion parameters. Furthermore, our model outperforms all other models on the zero-shot classification and VQA splits of MMEB (Jiang et al., 2024b), multimodal embedding benchmark spanning 19 tasks. Lastly, we design CtrlBench to measure our models ability to use natural language instructions to control retrieval. Using CtrlBench, we show that ABC can accomplish visual retrieval tasks that are fundamentally ambiguous without utilizing natural language instructions. Our contribution is threefold. (1) ABC: an open-source multimodal embedding model that uses natural language instructions to control visual embeddings. We demonstrate that ABC produces powerful embeddings by benchmarking on zero-shot tasks and robustly utilizes natural language instructions to control embeddings. (2) We provide decoupled methodology for adapting VLMs into SOTA multimodal embedding models. Previous work integrates instructions during the large-scale contrastive training run. We show that these stages can be decoupled, resulting in lightweight and adaptable instruction fine-tuning stage that requires only 100 training steps. (3) Lastly, we introduce CtrlBench, novel benchmark for measuring instructioncontrolled retrieval. CtrlBench requires the model to interleave modalities to retrieve the correct response. 2.

INTRODUCTION autonomous driving technology continues to advance, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have transitioned from an initial phase focused on technological competition to new phase centered on commercial deployment. However, when interacting with heterogeneous and uncontrolled Human-driven Vehicles (HVs), AVs often display behavior that appears overly arbitrary or difficult to interpret. This highlights significant deficiencies in their ability to interact effectively and express intentions clearly in complex scenarios. This work was supported in part by the State Key Lab of Intelligent Transportation System under Project No. 2024-A002, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52302502, 52472451), the Shanghai Scientific Innovation Foundation (No.23DZ1203400), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities. S. Fang, J. Liu, C. Xu, P. Hang and J. Sun are with the College of Transportation, Tongji University, Shanghai 201804, China, and the State Key Lab of Intelligent Transportation System, Beijing 100088, China. (e-mail: {2111219, liujiaqi13, 2151162, hangpeng, sunjian}@tongji.edu.cn). C. Lv is with the Nanyang Technological University, 639798, Singapore. (email: lyuchen@ntu.edu.sg). Various techniques have been proposed to enhance the interaction capabilities of AV, drawing from fields such as artificial potential field theory [1, 2], game theory [3, 4], and cognitive theory [5, 6]. However, intentions in these approaches often express rely on implicit signals, such as changes in acceleration or lateral movement. While such implicit communication is common and effective among human drivers, it tends to be less effective in AV-HV interaction due to the limited interaction experience and trust that people have with AVs. To address this, some studies have introduced external Human-Machine Interface (eHMI) that use text [7], images [8], or lights [9, 10] to explicitly convey the AV intentions. Whereas, existing methods typically depend on fixed-display modes based on predefined rules, which fail to account for the heterogeneity of interaction opponents or bidirectionality of intent communication [11, 12]. Given the remarkable advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language understanding and other domains [13, 14], they present promising avenue for enabling bidirectional intention exchange between AVs and HVs through natural language. Research has shown that LLMs can effectively support various functions in autonomous driving, such as perception[15, 16], decision-making [17, 18], and control [19]. However, current studies often focus on specific scenarios, which limits their generalizability [20]. Moreover, high-level reasoning often requires substantial computation time, and the computational resources of AVs are typically limited, making it difficult to ensure timely responses in dynamic interactions. Therefore, how to achieve real-time response with LLMs also remains to be addressed. Upon deeper analysis, we uncover three main challenges in improving the interaction and intent expression capabilities of AVs: Real-time adaptability and interpretability of decision: AVs must rapidly adapt their behavior to dynamic environments while ensuring their actions are interpretable to other road users for safe and efficient interactions. Heterogeneity and unpredictability of human drivers: AV decisions must be robust enough to handle the diverse driving styles and behaviors of HVs, ensuring effective interactions across heterogeneous HVs. Complexity and diversity of driving scenarios: versatile decision framework is needed to navigate diverse traffic environments, accommodating different conflict types and driving rules. 2 several experiments. Finally, conclusions are made in Section VI. II. LITERATURE REVIEW How to enhance the performance of AVs in complex interactive scenarios has garnered significant attention over the past few years. In this section, we summarize the advancements in improving decision-making interactivity, enhancing AVs intention visibility, and exploring the applications of LLMs in autonomous driving to uncover the key challenges that persist in driving interactions and to clarify the motivation behind this study. A. Interactive Decision-Making indicates that at AVs have now entered the commercial deployment stage both domestically and internationally. While they are capable of handling most driving scenarios, the Beijing Autonomous Vehicle Road Test Report least 36% of takeovers occur during interactions with other road users, indicating that there is still room for improvement in AV"

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), yet open-source multilingual LLMs remain scarce, with existing models often limited in language coverage. Such models typically prioritize well-resourced languages, while widely spoken but under-resourced languages are often overlooked. To address this disparity, we introduce Babel, an open multilingual LLM that covers the top 25 languages by number of speakers, supports over 90% of the global population, and includes many languages neglected by other open multilingual LLMs. Unlike traditional continue pretraining approaches, Babel expands its parameter count through a layer extension technique that elevates Babel's performance ceiling. We introduce two variants: Babel-9B, designed for efficient inference and fine-tuning, and Babel-83B, which sets a new standard for open multilingual LLMs. Extensive evaluations on multilingual tasks demonstrate its superior performance compared to open LLMs of comparable size. In addition, using open-source supervised fine-tuning datasets, Babel achieves remarkable performance, with Babel-9B-Chat leading among 10B-sized LLMs and Babel-83B-Chat setting a new standard for multilingual tasks, reaching the same level of commercial models.

"Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), yet open-source multilingual LLMs remain scarce, with existing models often limited in language coverage. Such models typically prioritize well-resourced languages, while widely spoken but under-resourced languages are often overlooked. To address this disparity, we introduce Babel, an open multilingual LLM that covers the top 25 languages by number of speakers, supports over 90% of the global population, and includes many languages neglected by other open multilingual LLMs. Unlike traditional continue pretraining approaches, Babel expands its parameter count through a layer extension technique that elevates Babel's performance ceiling. We introduce two variants: Babel-9B, designed for efficient inference and fine-tuning, and Babel-83B, which sets a new standard for open multilingual LLMs. Extensive evaluations on multilingual tasks demonstrate its superior performance compared to open LLMs of comparable size. In addition, using open-source supervised fine-tuning datasets, Babel achieves remarkable performance, with Babel-9B-Chat leading among 10B-sized LLMs and Babel-83B-Chat setting a new standard for multilingual tasks, reaching the same level of commercial models."

Visual embedding models excel at zero-shot tasks like visual retrieval and classification. However, these models cannot be used for tasks that contain ambiguity or require user instruction. These tasks necessitate a multimodal embedding model, which outputs embeddings that combine visual and natural language input. Existing CLIP-based approaches embed images and text independently, and fuse the result. We find that this results in weak interactions between modalities, and poor user control over the representation. We introduce ABC, an open-source multimodal embedding model that uses a vision-language model backbone to deeply integrate image features with natural language instructions. ABC achieves bestfor-size performance on MSCOCO image-to-text retrieval and is the top performing model on classification and VQA tasks in the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark. With a strongly unified vision-language representation, ABC can use natural language to solve subtle and potentially ambiguous visual retrieval problems. To evaluate this capability, we design CtrlBench, a benchmark that requires interleaving textual instructions with image content for correct retrieval. ABC advances the state of multimodal embeddings by offering high-quality representations and flexible natural language control. Our model and datasets are available at our project page.

We introduce KodCode, a synthetic dataset that addresses the persistent challenge of acquiring high-quality, verifiable training data across diverse difficulties and domains for training Large Language Models for coding. Existing code-focused resources typically fail to ensure either the breadth of coverage (e.g., spanning simple coding tasks to advanced algorithmic problems) or verifiable correctness (e.g., unit tests). In contrast, KodCode comprises question-solution-test triplets that are systematically validated via a self-verification procedure. Our pipeline begins by synthesizing a broad range of coding questions, then generates solutions and test cases with additional attempts allocated to challenging problems. Finally, post-training data synthesis is done by rewriting questions into diverse formats and generating responses under a test-based reject sampling procedure from a reasoning model (DeepSeek R1). This pipeline yields a large-scale, robust and diverse coding dataset. KodCode is suitable for supervised fine-tuning and the paired unit tests also provide great potential for RL tuning. Fine-tuning experiments on coding benchmarks (HumanEval(+), MBPP(+), BigCodeBench, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that KodCode-tuned models achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing models like Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B.

We present GEN3C, a generative video model with precise Camera Control and temporal 3D Consistency. Prior video models already generate realistic videos, but they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies, such as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented at all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural network which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast, GEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that GEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to infer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus all its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing the scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and monocular dynamic video. Results are best viewed in videos. Check out our webpage! https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/GEN3C/

"We present GEN3C, a generative video model with precise Camera Control and temporal 3D Consistency. Prior video models already generate realistic videos, but they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies, such as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented at all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural network which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast, GEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that GEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to infer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus all its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing the scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and monocular dynamic video. Results are best viewed in videos. Check out our webpage! https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/GEN3C/"

Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have entered the commercialization stage, but their limited ability to interact and express intentions still poses challenges in interactions with Human-driven Vehicles (HVs). Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable bidirectional human-machine communication, but the conflict between slow inference speed and the need for real-time decision-making challenges practical deployment. To address these issues, this paper introduces a parallel Actor-Reasoner framework designed to enable explicit bidirectional AV-HV interactions across multiple scenarios. First, by facilitating interactions between the LLM-driven Reasoner and heterogeneous simulated HVs during training, an interaction memory database, referred to as the Actor, is established. Then, by introducing the memory partition module and the two-layer memory retrieval module, the Actor's ability to handle heterogeneous HVs is significantly enhanced. Ablation studies and comparisons with other decision-making methods demonstrate that the proposed Actor-Reasoner framework significantly improves safety and efficiency. Finally, with the combination of the external Human-Machine Interface (eHMI) information derived from Reasoner's reasoning and the feasible action solutions retrieved from the Actor, the effectiveness of the proposed Actor-Reasoner is confirmed in multi-scenario field interactions. Our code is available at https://github.com/FanGShiYuu/Actor-Reasoner.
