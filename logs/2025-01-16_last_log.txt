Text:"Multimodal LLMs Can Reason about Aesthetics in Zero-Shot Ruixiang Jiang, Changwen Chen The Hong Kong Polytechnic University rui-x.jiang@connect.polyu.hk, changwen.chen@polyu.edu.hk 5 2 0 2 5 1 ] . [ 1 2 1 0 9 0 . 1 0 5 2 : r AbstractWe present the first study on how Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) reasoning ability shall be elicited to evaluate the aesthetics of artworks. To facilitate this investigation, we construct MM-StyleBench, novel high-quality dataset for benchmarking artistic stylization. We then develop principled method for human preference modeling and perform systematic correlation analysis between MLLMs responses and human preference. Our experiments reveal an inherent hallucination issue of MLLMs in art evaluation, associated with response subjectivity. ArtCoT is proposed, demonstrating that art-specific task decomposition and the use of concrete language boost MLLMs reasoning ability for aesthetics. Our findings offer valuable insights into MLLMs for art and can benefit wide range of downstream applications, such as style transfer and artistic image generation. Code available at https://github.com/ songrise/MLLM4Art. Index TermsArt evaluation, AI alignment, Style transfer, Chain-of-Thought prompting I. INTRODUCTION Recent advancement of computer vision (CV) algorithms, particularly in style transfer [1][3] and image generation models [4], [5], have democratized artistic creation, allowing users to personalize artworks with minimal expertise. However, the development of quantitative and interpretable evaluation protocols on artwork aesthetics has not kept pace. Without human-aligned evaluation metrics, it is challenging to systematically refine and enhance these generation methods, thereby limiting their potential to produce truly aesthetically pleasing artworks. Unlike most CV tasks, aesthetics evaluation is not welldefined with pure vision features alone. It requires higher-level assessments that consider factors such as cultural background, emotional impac"
