INTRODUCTION Intelligent beings have the ability to seamlessly combine variety of sensory feedback that allows them to effectively interact with physical the world. Beyond vision, humans rely on the touch and audio feedback to manipulate objects [1], [2], as they provide rich complementary information about object properties, especially when visual information alone might be insufficient to complete the task, such as when locating keys inside bag [3]. This stands in contrast to state-of-the-art generalist robot policies [4][8] that absorb knowledge from vast amount of robotics datasets [9] [13] but typically rely solely on visual and proprioceptive observations to perform wide range of tasks. The main factor limiting development of generalist robot policies based on truly hetereogeneous data is that, while nearly all robotics datasets include visual and proprioceptive information, only small minority of them include other modalities of sensory data [14][16]. This raises the question: how can we retain the generalization capabilities of generalist robot policies pre-trained on large amounts of data, while connecting their semantic knowledge with heterogeneous sensory data for which large datasets are not readily available?language can provide common interface between mixed-modal models, even when they are trained on minimally overlapping data domains [17][23]. Moreover, relating human language to multimodal percepts and actions naturally enables indexing goals using open-vocabulary queries mixing concepts from multiple distinct modalities (pick up the squishy, red object). Nonetheless, incorporating multiple sensing modalities, such as touch or audio, into robotic policies has thus far proved challenging due to data scarcity and in particular lack of data including joint reasoning over multimodal percepts and low-level robotic actions [2], [3], [14][16], [24][27]. In this work, we address these challenges and present recipe to finetune generalist robot policies on smaller-scale datasets comprising modalities complementary to vision, such as touch and sound, and demonstrate that novel capabilities and cross-modal semantic understanding are unlocked through this multimodal finetuning procedure. Our key insight is that by grounding all modalities in single common natural-language modality by way of an auxiliary loss, we can achieve joint reasoning over all modalities. By doing so, we enable our policy to perform challenging manipulation tasks that require reasoning jointly over vision, touch, and sound in zero-shot setting, enabling multimodal prompting, generation of object descriptions upon interaction, and compositional cross-modal prompting. In practice, our policy can successfully fulfill challenging task instructions, such as pick the red object that feels soft and makes loud sound, describe how the grasped object feels like, pick the object that has the same color as the button that plays piano. Our results show that policies leveraging pre-trained generalist robot policy finetuned on multimodal data consistently outperform baselines finetuned only on vision data, or trained from scratch on heterogeneous sensory data. We find that the same general recipe is applicable to generalist policies with widely different architectures, such as Octo [4], large transformer-based policy trained on the Open XEmbodiment [9] (OXE) dataset, and 3B VLA with PaliGemma [28] vision-language-model VLM backbone. For our experiments, we collect dataset consisting of 27K robot trajectories including vision, touch, audio, proprioception, and language instructions on three different real-world robotic manipulation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the first of its kind that also contains robot action data, which is key to perform physically grounded multimodal tasks. We open-source all of our data, code and models to support future research in this area. II. RELATED WORK A. Generalist R"

Interacting with the world is a multi-sensory experience: achieving effective general-purpose interaction requires making use of all available modalities -- including vision, touch, and audio -- to fill in gaps from partial observation. For example, when vision is occluded reaching into a bag, a robot should rely on its senses of touch and sound. However, state-of-the-art generalist robot policies are typically trained on large datasets to predict robot actions solely from visual and proprioceptive observations. In this work, we propose FuSe, a novel approach that enables finetuning visuomotor generalist policies on heterogeneous sensor modalities for which large datasets are not readily available by leveraging natural language as a common cross-modal grounding. We combine a multimodal contrastive loss with a sensory-grounded language generation loss to encode high-level semantics. In the context of robot manipulation, we show that FuSe enables performing challenging tasks that require reasoning jointly over modalities such as vision, touch, and sound in a zero-shot setting, such as multimodal prompting, compositional cross-modal prompting, and descriptions of objects it interacts with. We show that the same recipe is applicable to widely different generalist policies, including both diffusion-based generalist policies and large vision-language-action (VLA) models. Extensive experiments in the real world show that FuSeis able to increase success rates by over 20% compared to all considered baselines.

"Interacting with the world is a multi-sensory experience: achieving effective general-purpose interaction requires making use of all available modalities -- including vision, touch, and audio -- to fill in gaps from partial observation. For example, when vision is occluded reaching into a bag, a robot should rely on its senses of touch and sound. However, state-of-the-art generalist robot policies are typically trained on large datasets to predict robot actions solely from visual and proprioceptive observations. In this work, we propose FuSe, a novel approach that enables finetuning visuomotor generalist policies on heterogeneous sensor modalities for which large datasets are not readily available by leveraging natural language as a common cross-modal grounding. We combine a multimodal contrastive loss with a sensory-grounded language generation loss to encode high-level semantics. In the context of robot manipulation, we show that FuSe enables performing challenging tasks that require reasoning jointly over modalities such as vision, touch, and sound in a zero-shot setting, such as multimodal prompting, compositional cross-modal prompting, and descriptions of objects it interacts with. We show that the same recipe is applicable to widely different generalist policies, including both diffusion-based generalist policies and large vision-language-action (VLA) models. Extensive experiments in the real world show that FuSeis able to increase success rates by over 20% compared to all considered baselines."

Image matching for both cross-view and cross-modality plays a critical role in multimodal perception. In practice, the modality gap caused by different imaging systems/styles poses great challenges to the matching task. Existing works try to extract invariant features for specific modalities and train on limited datasets, showing poor generalization. In this paper, we present MINIMA, a unified image matching framework for multiple cross-modal cases. Without pursuing fancy modules, our MINIMA aims to enhance universal performance from the perspective of data scaling up. For such purpose, we propose a simple yet effective data engine that can freely produce a large dataset containing multiple modalities, rich scenarios, and accurate matching labels. Specifically, we scale up the modalities from cheap but rich RGB-only matching data, by means of generative models. Under this setting, the matching labels and rich diversity of the RGB dataset are well inherited by the generated multimodal data. Benefiting from this, we construct MD-syn, a new comprehensive dataset that fills the data gap for general multimodal image matching. With MD-syn, we can directly train any advanced matching pipeline on randomly selected modality pairs to obtain cross-modal ability. Extensive experiments on in-domain and zero-shot matching tasks, including 19 cross-modal cases, demonstrate that our MINIMA can significantly outperform the baselines and even surpass modality-specific methods. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/LSXI7/MINIMA .
