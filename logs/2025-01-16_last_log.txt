Generating 4D cities is more challenging than 3D scenes due to the presence of structurally complex, visually diverse objects like buildings and vehicles, and heightened human sensitivity to distortions in urban environments. To tackle these issues, we propose CityDreamer4D, compositional generative model specifically tailored for generating unbounded 4D cities. Our main insights are 1) 4D city generation should separate dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles) from static scenes (e.g., buildings and roads), and 2) all objects in the 4D scene should be composed of different types of neural fields for buildings, vehicles, and background stuff. Specifically, we propose Traffic Scenario Generator and Unbounded Layout Generator to produce dynamic traffic scenarios and static city layouts using highly compact BEV representation. Objects in 4D cities are generated by combining stuff-oriented and instance-oriented neural fields for background stuff, buildings, and vehicles. To suit the distinct characteristics of background stuff and instances, the neural fields employ customized generative hash grids and periodic positional embeddings as scene parameterizations.

Index TermsCity Generation, 4D Generation, Generative Models, NeRFA MID the rise of the metaverse, 3D and 4D asset generation has garnered significant attention. Notable progress has been made in generating 3D objects [1], [2], [3], avatars [4], [5], [6], and scenes [7], [8], [9], as well as 4D objects [10], [11] and avatars [12], [13], [14]. Cities, as one of the most essential assets, are widely used in diverse applications such as urban planning, environmental simulations, and game asset development. Therefore, the challenge of making 3D/4D city development accessible to wider audience, including artists, researchers, and players, becomes both significant and impactful. In recent years, notable advancements have been made in scene generation. Video-based methods [15], [16], [17] generate 3D scenes by producing videos conditioned on input images, but they cannot guarantee temporal consistency. Outpainting-based methods [18], [19], [20] generate 3D scenes through continuous outpainting on RGB and depth images, but they lack compact scene representation, resulting in scenes that are typically small in scale. PCGbased methods [21], [22], [23] create unbounded cities by integrating large language models (LLMs) with procedural content generation (PCG), but the diversity of the generated cities is constrained by the 3D assets employed. 3Daware-GAN-based methods, represented by GANCraft [24] This study is supported by the Ministry of Education, Singapore, under its MOE AcRF Tier 2 (MOE-T2EP20221-0012), NTU NAP, and under the RIE2020 Industry Alignment Fund Industry Collaboration Projects (IAF-ICP) Funding Initiative, as well as cash and in-kind contributions from the industry partner(s). (Corresponding author: Ziwei Liu.) The authors are with S-Lab, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 637335 (email: haozhe.xie@ntu.edu.sg; zhaoxi001@ntu.edu.sg; fangzhou.hong@ntu.edu.sg; ziwei.liu@ntu.edu.sg) Project page is available at https://haozhexie.com/project/city-dreamer-4d and SceneDreamer [7], use volumetric neural rendering to generate images within 3D scene, leveraging 3D coordinates and corresponding semantic labels. These methods show promising results in generating 3D natural scenes by leveraging pseudo-ground-truth images generated by SPADE [25]. InfiniCity [26] follows similar pipeline for 3D city generation but it is more complex than 3D natural scenes due to the greater appearance variation in buildings and vehicles, unlike the relatively consistent appearance of objects with the same semantic label in natural scenes. This variation reduces the quality of generated buildings and vehicles when all instances within their respective classes are assigned the same semantic label. Generating 4D scenes poses greater challenges than 3D scenes, as existing methods [27], [28], [29], [30] either fail to ensure temporal consistency or are confined to tiny scales. To address these problems, we propose CityDreamer4D, compositional generative model designed for unbounded 4D cities. As shown in Fig. 1, the unbounded 4D city generation framework separates dynamic objects from static scenes. Static scenes are defined by the city layout from Unbounded Layout Generator, arranging elements like roads, highways, vegetation, and buildings, with the capability to extrapolate to unbounded areas. Dynamic objects, such as vehicles, are defined by traffic scenarios generated by Traffic Scenario Generator, which determines their spatial positioning on high-fidelity (HD) maps derived from city layouts. Unlike existing methods that use single module for all objects, CityDreamer4D divides the generation process into three distinct modules: Building Instance Generator for buildings, Vehicle Instance Generator for vehicles, and City Background Generator for background stuff. These generators leverage highly compact birds-eye-view (BEV) scene representation to ensure efficiency and scalability. The scene parameterization is designed to address the unique characteristics of background stuff and instances: background stuff often features similar appearances with irregular textures, while buildings and vehicles display diverse appearances with regular periodic patterns. To handle these variations, we use generative hash grids for the background and apply periodic positional encodings to each instance. We also place buildings in an object-centric coordinate space and vehicles in an object-canonical coordinate space, using specialized methods designed to"

Multi-modal document retrieval is designed to identify and retrieve various forms of multi-modal content, such as figures, tables, charts, and layout information from extensive documents. Despite its significance, there is a notable lack of a robust benchmark to effectively evaluate the performance of systems in multi-modal document retrieval. To address this gap, this work introduces a new benchmark, named as MMDocIR, encompassing two distinct tasks: page-level and layout-level retrieval. The former focuses on localizing the most relevant pages within a long document, while the latter targets the detection of specific layouts, offering a more fine-grained granularity than whole-page analysis. A layout can refer to a variety of elements such as textual paragraphs, equations, figures, tables, or charts. The MMDocIR benchmark comprises a rich dataset featuring expertly annotated labels for 1,685 questions and bootstrapped labels for 173,843 questions, making it a pivotal resource for advancing multi-modal document retrieval for both training and evaluation. Through rigorous experiments, we reveal that (i) visual retrievers significantly outperform their text counterparts, (ii) MMDocIR train set can effectively benefit the training process of multi-modal document retrieval and (iii) text retrievers leveraging on VLM-text perform much better than those using OCR-text. These findings underscores the potential advantages of integrating visual elements for multi-modal document retrieval.

"Multi-modal document retrieval is designed to identify and retrieve various forms of multi-modal content, such as figures, tables, charts, and layout information from extensive documents. Despite its significance, there is a notable lack of a robust benchmark to effectively evaluate the performance of systems in multi-modal document retrieval. To address this gap, this work introduces a new benchmark, named as MMDocIR, encompassing two distinct tasks: page-level and layout-level retrieval. The former focuses on localizing the most relevant pages within a long document, while the latter targets the detection of specific layouts, offering a more fine-grained granularity than whole-page analysis. A layout can refer to a variety of elements such as textual paragraphs, equations, figures, tables, or charts. The MMDocIR benchmark comprises a rich dataset featuring expertly annotated labels for 1,685 questions and bootstrapped labels for 173,843 questions, making it a pivotal resource for advancing multi-modal document retrieval for both training and evaluation. Through rigorous experiments, we reveal that (i) visual retrievers significantly outperform their text counterparts, (ii) MMDocIR train set can effectively benefit the training process of multi-modal document retrieval and (iii) text retrievers leveraging on VLM-text perform much better than those using OCR-text.
