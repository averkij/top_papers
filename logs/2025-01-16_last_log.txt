INTRODUCTION ECENTLY, the research community has witnessed remarkable advancements in generative models, particularly in the domain of text-to-image generation (T2I) [1] [5]. These breakthroughs have garnered significant attention, showcasing the potential of generative models in producing diverse and realistic images from textual descriptions. Notably, diffusion models [6][11] have emerged as significant development, enabling the generation of high-fidelity images through the iterative diffusion of information within the model.

Inspired by these achievements, researchers are now exploring the application of diffusion models in the realm of text-tovideo (T2V) generation [12][26], aiming to generate visually compelling and contextually coherent videos with textual descriptions. In the realm of video generation, producing coherent and high-quality videos is inherently complex and demanding. Unlike static images, videos require the generation of sequential frames that exhibit spatial fidelity and temporal continuity. However, the availability of high-quality video datasets is significantly limited compared to image datasets, making it challenging to obtain diverse and representative training data. Additionally, generating single frame in video involves not only capturing visual details but also preserving smooth transitions and consistent motion across frames. Consequently, video generation entails substantial computational requirements due to the increased number of frames and the need for effective modeling of temporal dependencies. With the To overcome these challenges and advance the field of video generation, early video diffusion methods sought to extend state-of-the-art T2I models to text-to-video (T2V) generations, such as Make-A-Video [12], Imagen Video [13], Latent-Shift [14], MagicVideo [15], Video LDM [16], and Lavie [17]. These methods primarily adapt image diffusion models by incorporating temporal modules such as temporal attention [27], spatio-temporal attention [28], directed temporal attention [15], temporal shift [14], and 3D CNNs [16], and fine-tune them on RGB video data. recent success of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) [9], [10], [29] in text-to-image generation, which leverage transformers as the backbone of diffusion models, exploration has extended to text-to-video generation. significant advancement is achieved with the OpenAI Sora [30], which significantly scales spatial-temporal transformer model, marking milestone in video generation technology. Subsequently, transformer-based approaches, such as CogVideoX [31], Vidu [32] and MovieGen [33], have further advanced video generation. These methods typically use 3D VAE to compress input videos along spatial and temporal dimensions, yielding video latent representation. This latent is then flattened into the token sequence. transformer network captures spatial and temporal information within this sequence, effectively generating complex videos. Despite these significant successes, most studies have primarily focused on i.e., model size, dataset scale, scaling up model training, and compute budget, while offering limited insights into how representations directly impact the video generation process. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of transformer 2 Fig. 1: The examples generated by RepVideo. RepVideo effectively generates diverse videos with enhanced temporal coherence and fine-grained spatial details. representations within video diffusion models, focusing on their impact on spatial appearance and temporal consistency in video generation. Achieving both fine spatial detail and smooth temporal transitions is essential for producing highquality videos. To this end, we first investigate the spatial expressiveness of attention maps across transformer layers. Our findings reveal that the attention maps in each transformer layer exhibit substantial differences, with each layer focusing on distinct token information. While this enables the model to capture diverse spatial features, th"

Text:"Ouroboros-Diffusion: Exploring Consistent Content Generation in Tuning-free Long Video Diffusion* Jingyuan Chen1, Fuchen Long2, Jie An1, Zhaofan Qiu2, Ting Yao2, Jiebo Luo1, Tao Mei2 1 University of Rochester, Rochester, NY USA 2 HiDream.ai Inc. jchen157@u.rochester.edu, longfuchen@hidream.ai, jan6@cs.rochester.edu {qiuzhaofan, tiyao}@hidream.ai, jluo@cs.rochester.edu, tmei@hidream.ai 5 2 0 2 5 1 ] . [ 1 9 1 0 9 0 . 1 0 5 2 : r Abstract The first-in-first-out (FIFO) video diffusion, built on pretrained text-to-video model, has recently emerged as an effective approach for tuning-free long video generation. This technique maintains queue of video frames with progressively increasing noise, continuously producing clean frames at the queues head while Gaussian noise is enqueued at the tail. However, FIFO-Diffusion often struggles to keep longrange temporal consistency in the generated videos due to the lack of correspondence modeling across frames. In this paper, we propose Ouroboros-Diffusion, novel video denoising framework designed to enhance structural and content (subject) consistency, enabling the generation of consistent videos of arbitrary length. Specifically, we introduce new latent sampling technique at the queue tail to improve structural consistency, ensuring perceptually smooth transitions among frames. To enhance subject consistency, we devise Subject-Aware Cross-Frame Attention (SACFA) mechanism, which aligns subjects across frames within short segments to achieve better visual coherence. Furthermore, we introduce self-recurrent guidance. This technique leverages information from all previous cleaner frames at the front of the queue to guide the denoising of noisier frames at the end, fostering rich and contextual global information interaction. Extensive experiments of long video generation on the VBench benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our Ouroboros-Diffusion, particularly in terms of subject consistency, motion smoothness, and temporal consis"

"The first-in-first-out (FIFO) video diffusion, built on a pre-trained text-to-video model, has recently emerged as an effective approach for tuning-free long video generation. This technique maintains a queue of video frames with progressively increasing noise, continuously producing clean frames at the queue's head while Gaussian noise is enqueued at the tail. However, FIFO-Diffusion often struggles to keep long-range temporal consistency in the generated videos due to the lack of correspondence modeling across frames. In this paper, we propose Ouroboros-Diffusion, a novel video denoising framework designed to enhance structural and content (subject) consistency, enabling the generation of consistent videos of arbitrary length. Specifically, we introduce a new latent sampling technique at the queue tail to improve structural consistency, ensuring perceptually smooth transitions among frames. To enhance subject consistency, we devise a Subject-Aware Cross-Frame Attention (SACFA) mechanism, which aligns subjects across frames within short segments to achieve better visual coherence. Furthermore, we introduce self-recurrent guidance. This technique leverages information from all previous cleaner frames at the front of the queue to guide the denoising of noisier frames at the end, fostering rich and contextual global information interaction. Extensive experiments of long video generation on the VBench benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our Ouroboros-Diffusion, particularly in terms of subject consistency, motion smoothness, and temporal consistency."

In recent years, remarkable advancements in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) have been achieved in the fields of image synthesis and text generation, generating content comparable to that produced by humans. However, the quality of AI-generated music has not yet reached this standard, primarily due to the challenge of effectively controlling musical emotions and ensuring high-quality outputs. This paper presents a generalized symbolic music generation framework, XMusic, which supports flexible prompts (i.e., images, videos, texts, tags, and humming) to generate emotionally controllable and high-quality symbolic music. XMusic consists of two core components, XProjector and XComposer. XProjector parses the prompts of various modalities into symbolic music elements (i.e., emotions, genres, rhythms and notes) within the projection space to generate matching music. XComposer contains a Generator and a Selector. The Generator generates emotionally controllable and melodious music based on our innovative symbolic music representation, whereas the Selector identifies high-quality symbolic music by constructing a multi-task learning scheme involving quality assessment, emotion recognition, and genre recognition tasks. In addition, we build XMIDI, a large-scale symbolic music dataset that contains 108,023 MIDI files annotated with precise emotion and genre labels. Objective and subjective evaluations show that XMusic significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods with impressive music quality. Our XMusic has been awarded as one of the nine Highlights of Collectibles at WAIC 2023. The project homepage of XMusic is https://xmusic-project.github.io.
