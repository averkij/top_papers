The permissibility of doing so varies by jurisdiction: in countries like the EU and Japan, this is allowed under certain restrictions, while in the United States, the legal landscape is more ambiguous. Regardless of the legal status, concerns from creative producers have led to several high-proﬁle copyright lawsuits, and the threat of litigation is commonly cited as reason for the recent trend towards minimizing the information shared about training datasets by both corporate and public interest actors. This trend in limiting data information causes harm by hindering transparency, accountability, and innovation in the broader ecosystem by denying researchers, auditors, and impacted individuals access to the information needed to understand AI models. While this could be mitigated by training language models on open access and public domain data, at the time of writing, there are no such models (trained at meaningful scale) due to the substantial technical and sociological challenges in assembling the necessary corpus. These challenges include incomplete and unreliable metadata, the cost and complexity of digitizing physical records, and the diverse set of legal and technical skills required to ensure relevance and responsibility in quickly changing landscape. Building towards future where AI systems can be trained on openly licensed data that is responsibly curated and governed requires collaboration across legal, technical, and policy domains, along with investments in metadata standards, digitization, and fostering culture of openness. On June 11, 2024, Mozilla and EleutherAI convened 30 scholars and practitioners to create normative principles and technical best practices for creating openly licensed LLM training datasets. Based on that 1 The Dataset Convening was inspired by the format of the Columbia Convening on Openness in AI, collaboration between Columbia Universitys IGP and Mozilla, and held in February 2024 in New York. More details here and full publication here. convening, this paper outlines the challenges of navigating the production of open datasets and provides practical recommendations for sourcing, processing, governing, and releasing of these datasets. It seeks to be the foundation for shared practices and long-term goals within the emerging community around LLM data and to bring the community closer to making this technology truly open and trustworthy. 1.Today's AI systems depend on the data used to train large language models (LLMs), making dataset transparency critical for accountability and innovation. While AI companies used to be more open about their training data, as seen with Google's T5 or Meta's LLaMA 1, little is known about the datasets behind the most popular models from companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta today. Over the past year, AI companies have faced heavy criticism, particularly from literary and creative communities, over perceived exploitative data practices, leading to multiple high-proﬁle copyright lawsuits. Regardless of these lawsuits' legal merits, they have become one of several factors discouraging companies from disclosing their data sources and governance practices. Meanwhile, there is an ecosystem of open LLM developers startups, researchers, and nonproﬁt organizations who are increasing transparency in AI training data and promoting open access to those datasets. In June 2024, Mozilla and EleutherAI convened 30 scholars and practitioners from prominent open-source AI startups, nonproﬁt AI labs, and civil society organizations working on open access and openly licensed datasets for the Dataset Convening. After analyzing case studies from three of the leading open datasets (EleutherAIs forthcoming Common Pile, Pleias Common Corpus and YouTube-Commons), the group met to discuss the most pressing challenges and opportunities around creating open-access and openly licensed LLM training datasets. The group identiﬁed seven principles to guide the creation of these datasets: 1. Foster competitive LLM ecosystem 2. Enable accountability and transparency through reproducibility 3. Minimize harms and enable preference signals 4. Support and improve diversity 5. Strive for reciprocity 6. Work with other like-minded actors in this space 7. Preserve data for the long term The group also identiﬁed the challenges and pitfalls facing organizations seeking to build these datasets. This paper captures those insights, including emerging normative and technical recommendations for the community. The Dataset Convening was part of longer series of events co-hosted by Mozilla, inspired by (and including) the Columbia Convening (February 2024) which developed framework for openness 7 in AI, and continuing with an upcoming Columbia Convening on AI Openness and Safety (November 2024). The authors of this paper view openly available and openly licensed datasets as important because: 1. They can serve the public good by enabling developers to build upon others' work efﬁciently. 2. They can themselves be public goods that everyone can use without reducing their availability to others. 3. They create the right incentives for volunteer-driven or data donation-based processes. 4. They enable scrutiny, supporting AI accountability by facilitating new lines of inquiry for auditors and researchers, particularly in areas requiring manipulation of model training data. Many of the challenges faced by open dataset builders today bear resemblance"

[ 1 0 7 9 8 0 . 1 0 5 2 : r We often interact with untrusted parties. Prioritization of privacy can limit the effectiveness of these interactions, as achieving certain goals necessitates sharing private data. Traditionally, addressing this challenge has involved either seeking trusted intermediaries or constructing cryptographic protocols that restrict how much data is revealed, such as multi-party computations or zero-knowledge proofs. While significant advances have been made in scaling cryptographic approaches, they remain limited in terms of the size and complexity of applications they can be used for. In this paper, we argue that capable machine learning models can fulfill the role of trusted third party, thus enabling secure computations for applications that were previously infeasible. In particular, we describe Trusted Capable Model Environments (TCMEs) as an alternative approach for scaling secure computation, where capable machine learning model(s) interact under input/output constraints, with explicit information flow control and explicit statelessness. This approach aims to achieve balance between privacy and computational efficiency, enabling private inference where classical cryptographic solutions are currently infeasible. We describe number of use cases that are enabled by TCME, and show that even some simple classic cryptographic problems can already be solved with TCME. Finally, we outline current limitations and discuss the path forward in implementing them. 1. What are TCMEs? In this paper we contend that recent advancements in machine learning enable new paradigm for private inference. Fundamentally, the need for many cryptographic primitives stems from the fact that we dont have trusted third parties, thus requiring mutually untrusted pa"

Building towards a future where AI systems can be trained on openly licensed data that is responsibly curated and governed requires collaboration across legal, technical, and policy domains, along with investments in metadata standards, digitization, and fostering a culture of openness."

We often interact with untrusted parties. Prioritization of privacy can limit the effectiveness of these interactions, as achieving certain goals necessitates sharing private data. Traditionally, addressing this challenge has involved either seeking trusted intermediaries or constructing cryptographic protocols that restrict how much data is revealed, such as multi-party computations or zero-knowledge proofs. While significant advances have been made in scaling cryptographic approaches, they remain limited in terms of the size and complexity of applications they can be used for. In this paper, we argue that capable machine learning models can fulfill the role of a trusted third party, thus enabling secure computations for applications that were previously infeasible. In particular, we describe Trusted Capable Model Environments (TCMEs) as an alternative approach for scaling secure computation, where capable machine learning model(s) interact under input/output constraints, with explicit information flow control and explicit statelessness. This approach aims to achieve a balance between privacy and computational efficiency, enabling private inference where classical cryptographic solutions are currently infeasible. We describe a number of use cases that are enabled by TCME, and show that even some simple classic cryptographic problems can already be solved with TCME. Finally, we outline current limitations and discuss the path forward in implementing them.
