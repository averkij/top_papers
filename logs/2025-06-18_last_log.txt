Text:"5 2 0 2 6 1 ] . [ 1 2 0 0 4 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r Taming Polysemanticity in LLMs: Provable Feature Recovery via Sparse Autoencoders Siyu Chen Heejune Sheen Xuyuan Xiong Tianhao Wang Zhuoran Yang Department of Statistics and Data Science, Yale University Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago {siyu.chen.sc3226, heejune.sheen, zhuoran.yang}@yale.edu xxy2021@sjtu.edu.cn tianhao.wang@ttic.edu Abstract We study the challenge of achieving theoretically grounded feature recovery using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for the interpretation of Large Language Models. Existing SAE training algorithms often lack rigorous mathematical guarantees and suffer from practical limitations such as hyperparameter sensitivity and instability. To address these issues, we first propose novel statistical framework for the feature recovery problem, which includes new notion of feature identifiability by modeling polysemantic features as sparse mixtures of underlying monosemantic concepts. Building on this framework, we introduce new SAE training algorithm based on bias adaptation, technique that adaptively adjusts neural network bias parameters to ensure appropriate activation sparsity. We theoretically prove that this algorithm correctly recovers all monosemantic features when input data is sampled from our proposed statistical model. Furthermore, we develop an improved empirical variant, Group Bias Adaptation (GBA), and demonstrate its superior performance against benchmark methods when applied to LLMs with up to 1.5 billion parameters. This work represents foundational step in demystifying SAE training by providing the first SAE algorithm with theoretical recovery guarantees, thereby advancing the development of more transparent and trustworthy AI systems through enhanced mechanistic interpretability. TL;DR Existing Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) training algorithms often lack rigorous mathematical guarantees for feature recovery."

Text:"5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 5 5 7 4 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r aZhengxiang Cheng 1 Dongping Chen 1 Mingyang Fu 1 Tianyi ZhouLarge Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet they often suffer from producing unnecessary and verbose reasoning chains. We identify core aspect of this issue as invalid thinking models tend to repeatedly doublecheck their work after having derived the correct answer. To address this specific inefficiency, we move beyond the general principles of Efficacy and Efficiency to propose two new, fine-grained principles: Brevity, which advocates for eliminating redundancy, and Sufficiency, which ensures critical reasoning steps are preserved. Guided by these principles, we introduce LC-R1, posttraining method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). LC-R1 employs novel combination of Length Reward for overall conciseness and Compress Reward that is specifically designed to remove the invalid portion of the thinking process. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LC-R1 achieves significant reduction in sequence length (50%) with only marginal (2%) drop in accuracy, achieving favorable trade-off point on the Pareto frontier that prioritizes high compression. Our analysis further validates the robustness of LC-R1 and provides valuable insights for developing more powerful yet computationally efficient LRMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/zxiangx/LC-R1. Figure 1: Comparison between inefficient reasoning model and efficient model. The former tends to make verbose self-check process after having derived the correct answer corresponding to the given question, resulting in the inefficient reasoning. The model trained with LC-R1 get more efficient reasoning process to get correct answer, without any invalid thinking process. 1. Introduction Recent long-thought Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAIs O1 (Jaech et al., 2024) and Deepseek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), represent significant paradigm extension of foundational Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques (Wei et al., 2023). Fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning (RL), these models iteratively refine solutions to achieve unprecedented performance in complex reason1University of Maryland. Correspondence to: Tianyi Zhou <tianyi.david.zhou@gmail.com>. Preprint. Under review. ing tasks like mathematics and programming (Sun et al., 2025; Gu et al., 2024). However, with the improvement of deep thinking ability, prominent problem is the excessive consumption of computing resources during the reasoning process (Chen et al., 2025; Aggarwal and Welleck, 2025). Specifically, existing models tend to generate lengthy and even unnecessary chains of reasoning when solving problems with low complexity or clear solution paths. This phenomenon, termed overthinking, manifests as models consuming far more computational resources than the problem itself requires to reach the correct conclusion (Chen et al., 2024; Sui et al., 2025; Cuadron et al., 2025). There-Figure 2: Pareto analysis of the Efficacy-Efficiency trade-off of different methods on two reasoning models. The x-axis represents the reasoning length change, and the y-axis shows the accuracy change, relative to the original model (defined in Eq. 12), with the top-left corner representing the ideal position. smaller and darker marker indicates higher Valid Thinking (VT) rate (defined in Eq. 1), signifying more efficient thinking process. Compared to other methods also on the pareto frontier, LC-R1 achieves more favorable trade-off, attaining substantially higher compression rate at the cost of minimal drop in accuracy, and it also achieves higher VT rate. The sub-optimal performance of our ablation variants (w/o C-reward, w/o L-reward) further proves the criticality of our dual-reward designs. fore, one critical problem arises: How can we maintain high reasoning efficacy while significantly improving efficiency? Prior works have approached this by fine-tuning on shorter demonstrations (SFT) (Chen et al., 2024), constructing preference datasets for conciseness (Luo et al., 2025a; Shen et al., 2025), or integrating length-penalties into RL (Hou et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2025b; Team et al., 2025). However, these methods often treat the reasoning process as black box, penalizing length without analyzing the internal structure of the thoughts themselves. To address this gap, we delve into the structure of overthinking and identify specific pattern: models frequently engage in redundant double-checking after having already derived the correct answer. We term this phenomenon invalid thinking, as shown in Figure 1. To quantify it, we introduce new metric, Valid Thinking (VT) Rate, which measures the proportion of the reasoning process that is essential for reaching the initial correct conclusion. Guided by this insight, we propose two fine-grained principles: Brevity (eliminating redundancy) and Sufficiency (preserving necessary steps). We then introduce LC-R1, GRPO-based post-training method that operationalizes these principles. LC-R1 uniquely combines Length Reward for overall conciseness with novel Compress Reward designed to directly guide the model to terminate the thinking process upon deriving the correct answer. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two reasoning models across seven benchmarks. Empirical results show that LC-R1 achieves more favorable trade-off between efficacy and efficiency than prior methods as shown in Figure 2. Specifically, with only 2% drop in accuracy, our method attains 50% reduction in sequence length on average. Ablation study also demonstrates the indispensability of both Length Reward and Compress Reward for achieving efficient reasoning. Further study shows that our method achieves efficient compression without impairing the exploration ability of model, and the efficiency can generalize to various difficulty problems. In conclusion, our contribution can be summarized as follows: We analyze the thinking process of current competitive reasoning model and find the phenomenon of invalid thinking : It takes large portion of thinking process to double check after having derived the correct answer, making the reasoning verbose and inefficient. We propose two novel principles: Brevity and Sufficiency, and design GRPO-based method LC-R1 for LRM post-training to strike balance between Brevity and Sufficiency, pruning invalid thinking while compressing overall sequences at the same time.

Stream-Omni, a large multimodal model, integrates text, vision, and speech by efficiently aligning modalities using sequence-dimension concatenation for vision and layer-dimension mapping for speech, achieving strong performance with less data.  					AI-generated summary 				 The emergence of GPT-4o-like large multimodal models (LMMs) has raised the exploration of integrating text, vision, and speech modalities to support more flexible multimodal interaction. Existing LMMs typically concatenate representation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a large language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is straightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on large-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model the relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more efficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose Stream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality alignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various modality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the vision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is semantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension concatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically consistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension mapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve modality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer of text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual understanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction tasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously provide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model responses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal experience.

"Stream-Omni, a large multimodal model, integrates text, vision, and speech by efficiently aligning modalities using sequence-dimension concatenation for vision and layer-dimension mapping for speech, achieving strong performance with less data.  					AI-generated summary 				 The emergence of GPT-4o-like large multimodal models (LMMs) has raised the exploration of integrating text, vision, and speech modalities to support more flexible multimodal interaction. Existing LMMs typically concatenate representation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a large language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is straightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on large-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model the relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more efficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose Stream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality alignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various modality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the vision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is semantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension concatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically consistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension mapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve modality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer of text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual understanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction tasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously provide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model responses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal experience."

A novel ISA-centric transpilation pipeline using LLMs and software testing achieves high correctness and efficiency in translating between complex and reduced hardware architectures.  					AI-generated summary 				 The hardware ecosystem is rapidly evolving, with increasing interest in translating low-level programs across different instruction set architectures (ISAs) in a quick, flexible, and correct way to enhance the portability and longevity of existing code. A particularly challenging class of this transpilation problem is translating between complex- (CISC) and reduced- (RISC) hardware architectures, due to fundamental differences in instruction complexity, memory models, and execution paradigms. In this work, we introduce GG (Guaranteed Guess), an ISA-centric transpilation pipeline that combines the translation power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with the rigor of established software testing constructs. Our method generates candidate translations using an LLM from one ISA to another, and embeds such translations within a software-testing framework to build quantifiable confidence in the translation. We evaluate our GG approach over two diverse datasets, enforce high code coverage (>98%) across unit tests, and achieve functional/semantic correctness of 99% on HumanEval programs and 49% on BringupBench programs, respectively. Further, we compare our approach to the state-of-the-art Rosetta 2 framework on Apple Silicon, showcasing 1.73x faster runtime performance, 1.47x better energy efficiency, and 2.41x better memory usage for our transpiled code, demonstrating the effectiveness of GG for real-world CISC-to-RISC translation tasks. We will open-source our codes, data, models, and benchmarks to establish a common foundation for ISA-level code translation research.

This study investigates long-context performance of diffusion LLMs compared to auto-regressive LLMs, identifies their unique characteristics, and proposes LongLLaDA, a training-free method for extending context windows.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Diffusion Models, or diffusion LLMs, have emerged as a significant focus in NLP research, with substantial effort directed toward understanding their scalability and downstream task performance. However, their long-context capabilities remain unexplored, lacking systematic analysis or methods for context extension. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation comparing the long-context performance of diffusion LLMs and traditional auto-regressive LLMs. We first identify a unique characteristic of diffusion LLMs, unlike auto-regressive LLMs, they maintain remarkably \textit{stable perplexity} during direct context extrapolation. Furthermore, where auto-regressive models fail outright during the Needle-In-A-Haystack task with context exceeding their pretrained length, we discover diffusion LLMs exhibit a distinct \textit{local perception} phenomenon, enabling successful retrieval from recent context segments. We explain both phenomena through the lens of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) scaling theory. Building on these observations, we propose LongLLaDA, a training-free method that integrates LLaDA with the NTK-based RoPE extrapolation. Our results validate that established extrapolation scaling laws remain effective for extending the context windows of diffusion LLMs. Furthermore, we identify long-context tasks where diffusion LLMs outperform auto-regressive LLMs and others where they fall short. Consequently, this study establishes the first context extrapolation method for diffusion LLMs while providing essential theoretical insights and empirical benchmarks critical for advancing future research on long-context diffusion LLMs.

A new statistical framework and training algorithm, Group Bias Adaptation, enhance Sparse Autoencoders for recovering monosemantic features in Large Language Models, offering theoretical guarantees and superior performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 We study the challenge of achieving theoretically grounded feature recovery using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for the interpretation of Large Language Models. Existing SAE training algorithms often lack rigorous mathematical guarantees and suffer from practical limitations such as hyperparameter sensitivity and instability. To address these issues, we first propose a novel statistical framework for the feature recovery problem, which includes a new notion of feature identifiability by modeling polysemantic features as sparse mixtures of underlying monosemantic concepts. Building on this framework, we introduce a new SAE training algorithm based on ``bias adaptation'', a technique that adaptively adjusts neural network bias parameters to ensure appropriate activation sparsity. We theoretically prove that this algorithm correctly recovers all monosemantic features when input data is sampled from our proposed statistical model. Furthermore, we develop an improved empirical variant, Group Bias Adaptation (GBA), and demonstrate its superior performance against benchmark methods when applied to LLMs with up to 1.5 billion parameters. This work represents a foundational step in demystifying SAE training by providing the first SAE algorithm with theoretical recovery guarantees, thereby advancing the development of more transparent and trustworthy AI systems through enhanced mechanistic interpretability.

Flow maps, introduced with new continuous-time objectives and training techniques, achieve state-of-the-art performance in few-step image and text-to-image generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion- and flow-based models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative modeling approaches, but they require many sampling steps. Consistency models can distill these models into efficient one-step generators; however, unlike flow- and diffusion-based methods, their performance inevitably degrades when increasing the number of steps, which we show both analytically and empirically. Flow maps generalize these approaches by connecting any two noise levels in a single step and remain effective across all step counts. In this paper, we introduce two new continuous-time objectives for training flow maps, along with additional novel training techniques, generalizing existing consistency and flow matching objectives. We further demonstrate that autoguidance can improve performance, using a low-quality model for guidance during distillation, and an additional boost can be achieved by adversarial finetuning, with minimal loss in sample diversity. We extensively validate our flow map models, called Align Your Flow, on challenging image generation benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art few-step generation performance on both ImageNet 64x64 and 512x512, using small and efficient neural networks. Finally, we show text-to-image flow map models that outperform all existing non-adversarially trained few-step samplers in text-conditioned synthesis.

LC-R1, a post-training method guided by Brevity and Sufficiency principles, reduces unnecessary reasoning in Large Reasoning Models with minimal accuracy loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet they often suffer from producing unnecessary and verbose reasoning chains. We identify a core aspect of this issue as "invalid thinking" -- models tend to repeatedly double-check their work after having derived the correct answer. To address this specific inefficiency, we move beyond the general principles of Efficacy and Efficiency to propose two new, fine-grained principles: Brevity, which advocates for eliminating redundancy, and Sufficiency, which ensures critical reasoning steps are preserved. Guided by these principles, we introduce LC-R1, a post-training method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). LC-R1 employs a novel combination of a Length Reward for overall conciseness and a Compress Reward that is specifically designed to remove the invalid portion of the thinking process. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LC-R1 achieves a significant reduction in sequence length (~50%) with only a marginal (~2%) drop in accuracy, achieving a favorable trade-off point on the Pareto frontier that prioritizes high compression. Our analysis further validates the robustness of LC-R1 and provides valuable insights for developing more powerful yet computationally efficient LRMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/zxiangx/LC-R1.

A framework, TR2M, uses multimodal inputs to rescale relative depth to metric depth, enhancing performance across various datasets through cross-modality attention and contrastive learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 This work presents a generalizable framework to transfer relative depth to metric depth. Current monocular depth estimation methods are mainly divided into metric depth estimation (MMDE) and relative depth estimation (MRDE). MMDEs estimate depth in metric scale but are often limited to a specific domain. MRDEs generalize well across different domains, but with uncertain scales which hinders downstream applications. To this end, we aim to build up a framework to solve scale uncertainty and transfer relative depth to metric depth. Previous methods used language as input and estimated two factors for conducting rescaling. Our approach, TR2M, utilizes both text description and image as inputs and estimates two rescale maps to transfer relative depth to metric depth at pixel level. Features from two modalities are fused with a cross-modality attention module to better capture scale information. A strategy is designed to construct and filter confident pseudo metric depth for more comprehensive supervision. We also develop scale-oriented contrastive learning to utilize depth distribution as guidance to enforce the model learning about intrinsic knowledge aligning with the scale distribution. TR2M only exploits a small number of trainable parameters to train on datasets in various domains and experiments not only demonstrate TR2M's great performance in seen datasets but also reveal superior zero-shot capabilities on five unseen datasets. We show the huge potential in pixel-wise transferring relative depth to metric depth with language assistance. (Code is available at: https://github.com/BeileiCui/TR2M)
