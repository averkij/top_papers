Text:"DiffusionBlocks: Blockwise Training for Generative Models via Score-Based Diffusion Makoto Shing 1 Takuya Akiba 1 5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 2 0 2 4 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r aTraining large neural networks with end-to-end backpropagation creates significant memory bottlenecks, limiting accessibility to state-of-the-art AI research. We propose DiffusionBlocks, novel training framework that interprets neural network blocks as performing denoising operations in continuous-time diffusion process. By partitioning the network into independently trainable blocks and optimizing noise level assignments based on equal cumulative probability mass, our approach achieves significant memory efficiency while maintaining competitive performance compared to traditional backpropagation in generative tasks. Experiments on image generation and language modeling tasks demonstrate memory reduction proportional to the number of blocks while achieving superior performance. DiffusionBlocks provides promising pathway for democratizing access to large-scale neural network training with limited computational resources. 1. Introduction As neural networks grow following established scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022), they become increasingly inaccessible to much of the research community. Training models with hundreds of billions of parameters requires computational resources available only to select institutions, threatening to concentrate AI advancement within well-resourced organizations. The fundamental bottleneck lies in end-to-end backpropagation (Rumelhart et al., 1986; He et al., 2016), which requires storing intermediate activations across the entire network, resulting in prohibitive memory demands for large models. This memory bottleneck is particularly critical for generative AI applications, where large-scale models are essential 1Sakana AI. Correspondence to: Makoto Shing <mkshing@sakana.ai>, Takuya Akiba <takiba@sakana.ai>. Figure 1. Overview of DiffusionBlocks compared to end-to-end backpropagation. Traditional training (top) requires backpropagating gradients through all blocks, creating memory bottlenecks. Our approach (bottom) trains each block independently as diffusion-based denoiser for specific noise range, eliminating gradient dependencies and achieving B-fold memory reduction during training. for high-quality generation. Previous layerwise training approaches (Hinton, 2022; Bengio et al., 2006; Nøkland & Eidnes, 2019; Belilovsky et al., 2019; Siddiqui et al., 2024) have underperformed compared to end-to-end backpropagation, primarily because they lack principled mechanisms to coordinate information flow between independently trained layers and struggle to balance parameter allocation effectively. Moreover, these approaches have been predominantly evaluated on image classification tasks, with limited exploration of generative modeling applications. Meanwhile, diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021) have revolutionized generative modeling through their mathematically principled approach to distribution transformation. Recent advances in network conditioning (Karras et al., 2022) and sampling efficiency (Lu et al., 2022; 2023; Zhao et al., 2023) have established diffusion models as state-ofthe-art across multiple domains. TTODLer-FM Workshop of the 42 nd International Conference on Machine Learning. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). We propose DiffusionBlocks, framework that reconceptualizes neural network training by interpreting network blocks 1 DiffusionBlocks as implementing discretized steps of continuous-time reverse diffusion process. Our key innovation is principled mapping between network blocks and noise-level ranges based on equal cumulative probability mass, ensuring each block confronts an equally challenging learning problem. This approach enables independent block training without requiring gradient communication between blocks. Through experiments on image generation and language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that DiffusionBlocks reduces memory requirements proportionally to the number of blocks while achieving competitive or superior performance. Our primary contributions are: diffusion-inspired blockwise training framework achieving true block independence in continuous time, where each block can be trained without requiring gradients from other blocks. An equi-probability partitioning strategy that optimally allocates learning difficulty across blocks based on cumulative probability mass, ensuring balanced parameter utilization. Comprehensive empirical validation demonstrating Bfold memory reduction (with blocks) and improved performance on both image generation and language modeling tasks. Figure 1 illustrates our approach compared to traditional end-to-end backpropagation. Unlike conventional methods that require gradient flow across all blocks, DiffusionBlocks enables truly independent block training through diffusionbased denoising objectives. 2. Preliminaries 2.1. Score-Based Diffusion Models Let z0 Rd pdata denote clean data sample. Following the Variance-Exploding (VE) formulation (Song et al., 2021; Karras et al., 2022), we perturb z0 with Gaussian noise whose standard deviation σ(t) increases monotonically with the (continuous) time variable [0, 1]: zt = z0 + σ(t)ϵ, ϵ (0, I). (1) This gives zt (z0, σ(t)2I) = pt(ztz0) with marginal distribution pt(zt) = (cid:82) pdata(z0)pt(ztz0)dz0. The continuous-time formulation of this process is described by stochastic differential equation (SDE): dzt = (cid:114) dσ(t)2 dt dw, [0, 1] (2) where is standard Wiener process. For generating samples, we employ the Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE), which shares the same marginal distributions as the SDE but follows deterministic trajectories: dzt dt = σ(t)σ(t)z log pt(zt) (3) where σ(t) = dσ(t) and log pt(zt) is the score of the dt density pt(zt). Following Karras et al. (2022), we can eliminate the abstract time variable by parameterizing directly in terms of noise levels. Setting σ(t) = t, the PF-ODE simplifies to: dzσ dσ = σz log pσ(zσ). (4) To estimate this score function, we parameterize it using neural network. We leverage the relation log pσ(zσ) z0zσ (Robbins, 1992) to approximate the score in terms of σ denoiser Dθ(zσ, σ) that predicts the clean data: log pσ(zσ) Dθ(zσ, σ) zσ σ2 (5) The denoiser is trained using weighted L2 loss: L(θ) = Epdata,pσ,N (0,I) (cid:2)w(σ)Dθ(zσ, σ) z02 2 (cid:3) (6) where w(σ) is"

A large, 24-trillion-token Essential-Web v1.0 dataset annotated with a multi-category taxonomy outperforms or is competitive with existing datasets in various domains using simple filtering techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 Data plays the most prominent role in how language models acquire skills and knowledge. The lack of massive, well-organized pre-training datasets results in costly and inaccessible data pipelines. We present Essential-Web v1.0, a 24-trillion-token dataset in which every document is annotated with a twelve-category taxonomy covering topic, format, content complexity, and quality. Taxonomy labels are produced by EAI-Distill-0.5b, a fine-tuned 0.5b-parameter model that achieves an annotator agreement within 3% of Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct. With nothing more than SQL-style filters, we obtain competitive web-curated datasets in math (-8.0% relative to SOTA), web code (+14.3%), STEM (+24.5%) and medical (+8.6%).

A novel training framework called DiffusionBlocks optimizes neural network blocks as denoising operations in a diffusion process, achieving memory efficiency and competitive performance in generative tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Training large neural networks with end-to-end backpropagation creates significant memory bottlenecks, limiting accessibility to state-of-the-art AI research. We propose DiffusionBlocks, a novel training framework that interprets neural network blocks as performing denoising operations in a continuous-time diffusion process. By partitioning the network into independently trainable blocks and optimizing noise level assignments based on equal cumulative probability mass, our approach achieves significant memory efficiency while maintaining competitive performance compared to traditional backpropagation in generative tasks. Experiments on image generation and language modeling tasks demonstrate memory reduction proportional to the number of blocks while achieving superior performance. DiffusionBlocks provides a promising pathway for democratizing access to large-scale neural network training with limited computational resources.

MIDI-RWKV, a novel RWKV-7 based model, enables efficient and coherent musical infilling on edge devices with personalizable initial states, enhancing the computer-assisted composition process.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing work in automatic music generation has primarily focused on end-to-end systems that produce complete compositions or continuations. However, because musical composition is typically an iterative process, such systems make it difficult to engage in the back-and-forth between human and machine that is essential to computer-assisted creativity. In this study, we address the task of personalizable, multi-track, long-context, and controllable symbolic music infilling to enhance the process of computer-assisted composition. We present MIDI-RWKV, a novel model based on the RWKV-7 linear architecture, to enable efficient and coherent musical cocreation on edge devices. We also demonstrate that MIDI-RWKV admits an effective method of finetuning its initial state for personalization in the very-low-sample regime. We evaluate MIDI-RWKV and its state tuning on several quantitative and qualitative metrics, and release model weights and code at https://github.com/christianazinn/MIDI-RWKV.

Модель позволяет персонализировать начальное состояние, что улучшает процесс компьютерно-ассистированного сочинения музыки. В отличие от существующих систем генерации музыки, MIDI-RWKV фокусируется на задаче многодорожечного заполнения с длинным контекстом, что более соответствует итеративному процессу музыкальной композиции. Авторы оценили модель по количественным и качественным метрикам и выложили веса модели и код в открытый доступ.",
