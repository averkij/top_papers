Text:"5 2 0 2 5 1 ] . [ 1 8 2 9 2 1 . 6 0 5 2 : r Scaling Test-time Compute for LLM AgentsScaling test time compute has shown remarkable success in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we conduct the first systematic exploration of applying test-time scaling methods to language agents and investigate the extent to which it improves their effectiveness. Specifically, we explore different test-time scaling strategies, including: (1) parallel sampling algorithms; (2) sequential revision strategies; (3) verifiers and merging methods; (4)strategies for diversifying rollouts. We carefully analyze and ablate the impact of different design strategies on applying test-time scaling on language agents, and have follow findings: 1. Scaling test time compute could improve the performance of agents. 2. Knowing when to reflect is important for agents. 3. Among different verification and result merging approaches, the list-wise method performs best. 4. Increasing diversified rollouts exerts positive effect on the agents task performance. Date: June 17, 2025 Correspondence: Wangchunshu Zhou at zhouwangchunshu@oppo.com Code: https://github.com/OPPO-PersonalAI/OAgentsLanguage agents demonstrate exceptional capabilities in various domains [5, 9, 26, 3335].For example, LangChain[24] connects LLMs with various tools to solve different tasks in an end-to-end manner, while Meta-GPT[9] enables multiple AI Agents to take on different roles and collaborate to accomplish tasks. Recently, long-thinking models like O1 [11] and R1 [8] showcase excellent reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent approaches [15, 18] leverage the extended thinking capabilities of long-activation models for planning, code writing, tool calling, and completing complex tasks. However, despite LLMs strong capabilities, they still struggle to match human performance on complex search and reasoning tasks [12, 32]. This occurs due to remaining limitations in model capabilities, errors in task planning and question answering, and issues with complex tool calling abilities. Increasing computational resources during the inference phase greatly enhances LLMs performance. Some works [19, 20] improve model exploration during inference through different sampling strategies, achieving excellent scores in challenging areas like mathematical reasoning.Charlie Snell et al.[25] investigated the effects of scaling inference-time computational consumption, while Wei Xiong et al.[31] focused on enhancing model performance through self-correction methods. However, directly applying TTS methods to the Agentic Framework presents many challenges. Unlike LLMs that solve specific problems in an end-to-end manner, Agents typically decompose complex problems into distinct steps, invoking multiple models sequentially for resolution. Due to the extended sequence of steps and the accumulation of errors, traditional TTS methods (e.g., BoN) can significantly undermine the final outcome, because they randomly generate responses at each step. 1 To address the aforementioned challenges, we first conduct systematic exploration of test-time scaling methods for language agents. First, we investigate the effectiveness of different parallel sampling methods for agentic test-time scaling, including variants of Best-of-N (BoN), beam search, and tree search algorithms. We adapt and implement these parallel sampling mechanisms within language agents and showing that despite simplicity, BoN achieves the optimal performance. Subsequently, we investigate the effectiveness of various sequential revision techniques, such as reflection and self-refinement, for language agents. We introduce reflection agent to summarize and reflect based on the current state and recent actions/observations to help the agent consistently progress toward accomplishing the task. Experimental results show that the direct gains from having the agent perform reflection at each step are not obvious. Instead, allowing the agent to perform reflection when it performs poorly in the current step brings certain benefits. This indicates that knowing when the agent should reflect is more important than having the agent perform reflection at every step directly. Finally, we conduct detailed study on the impact of different verify and result merging methods, including voting, scoring, and list-wise approaches. Our experimental results demonstrate that whether for merge results methods or verify methods, using the list-wise method outperforms other methods. This provides an effective verify method reference for agentic frameworks. Finally, we test different strategies to expand the agents exploration space and enhance the diversity of different rollouts, and propose multi-agent collaborative sampling strategy. Experimental results indicate that performance under multi-agent collaboration surpasses that of single agent. Our core contributions are: We explore the application of different parallel sampling strategies in agentic frameworks. Through parallel sampling strategies, agent performance can be significantly improved. We study the impact of sequential revision techniques in agentic frameworks. In particular, we point out that it is very important for agents to know when they should perform revision. We also conduct detailed comparative analysis of different verify and result merge strategies. Experiments show that the list-wise method significantly outperforms other methods.In this section, we describe and compare different strategies for agentic test-time scaling including: (1) Parallel Sampling Algorithms; (2) Sequential Revision Strategies; (3) Verifier and Result Merging Methods; (4) Strategies for Diversifying Rollouts."

Systematic exploration of test-time scaling methods in large language agents reveals that computational scaling improves performance, especially through parallel sampling, sequential revision, effective verification, and increased rollout diversity.  					AI-generated summary 				 Scaling test time compute has shown remarkable success in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we conduct the first systematic exploration of applying test-time scaling methods to language agents and investigate the extent to which it improves their effectiveness. Specifically, we explore different test-time scaling strategies, including: (1) parallel sampling algorithms; (2) sequential revision strategies; (3) verifiers and merging methods; (4)strategies for diversifying rollouts.We carefully analyze and ablate the impact of different design strategies on applying test-time scaling on language agents, and have follow findings: 1. Scaling test time compute could improve the performance of agents. 2. Knowing when to reflect is important for agents. 3. Among different verification and result merging approaches, the list-wise method performs best. 4. Increasing diversified rollouts exerts a positive effect on the agent's task performance.

A comprehensive benchmark, CRITICTOOL, evaluates and enhances the robustness of large language models in handling errors during tool usage.  					AI-generated summary 				 The ability of large language models (LLMs) to utilize external tools has enabled them to tackle an increasingly diverse range of tasks. However, as the tasks become more complex and long-horizon, the intricate tool utilization process may trigger various unexpected errors. Therefore, how to effectively handle such errors, including identifying, diagnosing, and recovering from them, has emerged as a key research direction for advancing tool learning. In this work, we first extensively analyze the types of errors encountered during the function-calling process on several competitive tool evaluation benchmarks. Based on it, we introduce CRITICTOOL, a comprehensive critique evaluation benchmark specialized for tool learning. Building upon a novel evolutionary strategy for dataset construction, CRITICTOOL holds diverse tool-use errors with varying complexities, which better reflects real-world scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments on CRITICTOOL, and validate the generalization and effectiveness of our constructed benchmark strategy. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the tool reflection ability on various LLMs, offering a new perspective on the field of tool learning in LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Shellorley0513/CriticTool{https://github.com/Shellorley0513/CriticTool}.

However, as the tasks become more complex and long-horizon, the intricate tool utilization process may trigger various unexpected errors. Therefore, how to effectively handle such errors, including identifying, diagnosing, and recovering from them, has emerged as a key research direction for advancing tool learning. In this work, we first extensively analyze the types of errors encountered during the function-calling process on several competitive tool evaluation benchmarks. Based on it, we introduce CRITICTOOL, a comprehensive critique evaluation benchmark specialized for tool learning. Building upon a novel evolutionary strategy for dataset construction, CRITICTOOL holds diverse tool-use errors with varying complexities, which better reflects real-world scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments on CRITICTOOL, and validate the generalization and effectiveness of our constructed benchmark strategy. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the tool reflection ability on various LLMs, offering a new perspective on the field of tool learning in LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Shellorley0513/CriticTool{https://github.com/Shellorley0513/CriticTool}."

We introduce xbench, a dynamic, profession-aligned evaluation suite designed to bridge the gap between AI agent capabilities and real-world productivity. While existing benchmarks often focus on isolated technical skills, they may not accurately reflect the economic value agents deliver in professional settings. To address this, xbench targets commercially significant domains with evaluation tasks defined by industry professionals. Our framework creates metrics that strongly correlate with productivity value, enables prediction of Technology-Market Fit (TMF), and facilitates tracking of product capabilities over time. As our initial implementations, we present two benchmarks: Recruitment and Marketing. For Recruitment, we collect 50 tasks from real-world headhunting business scenarios to evaluate agents' abilities in company mapping, information retrieval, and talent sourcing. For Marketing, we assess agents' ability to match influencers with advertiser needs, evaluating their performance across 50 advertiser requirements using a curated pool of 836 candidate influencers. We present initial evaluation results for leading contemporary agents, establishing a baseline for these professional domains. Our continuously updated evalsets and evaluations are available at https://xbench.org.

A new evaluation metric called Alignment Quality Index (AQI) assesses the alignment of large language models by analyzing latent space activations, capturing clustering quality to detect misalignments and fake alignment, and complementing existing behavioral proxies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Alignment is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity. As large language models (LLMs) enter high-stakes domains like education, healthcare, governance, and law, their behavior must reliably reflect human-aligned values and safety constraints. Yet current evaluations rely heavily on behavioral proxies such as refusal rates, G-Eval scores, and toxicity classifiers, all of which have critical blind spots. Aligned models are often vulnerable to jailbreaking, stochasticity of generation, and alignment faking.   To address this issue, we introduce the Alignment Quality Index (AQI). This novel geometric and prompt-invariant metric empirically assesses LLM alignment by analyzing the separation of safe and unsafe activations in latent space. By combining measures such as the Davies-Bouldin Score (DBS), Dunn Index (DI), Xie-Beni Index (XBI), and Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI) across various formulations, AQI captures clustering quality to detect hidden misalignments and jailbreak risks, even when outputs appear compliant. AQI also serves as an early warning signal for alignment faking, offering a robust, decoding invariant tool for behavior agnostic safety auditing.   Additionally, we propose the LITMUS dataset to facilitate robust evaluation under these challenging conditions. Empirical tests on LITMUS across different models trained under DPO, GRPO, and RLHF conditions demonstrate AQI's correlation with external judges and ability to reveal vulnerabilities missed by refusal metrics. We make our implementation publicly available to foster future research in this area.
