However, the issue of copyright protection for LoRA weights, especially through watermarkbased techniques, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose SEAL (SEcure wAtermarking on LoRA weights), the universal whitebox watermarking for LoRA. SEAL embeds secret, non-trainable matrix between trainable LoRA weights, serving as passport to claim ownership. SEAL then entangles the passport with the LoRA weights through training, without extra loss for entanglment, and distributes the finetuned weights after hiding the passport. When applying SEAL, we observed no performance degradation across commonsense reasoning, textual/visual instruction tuning, and text-to-image synthesis tasks. We demonstrate that SEAL is robust against variety of known attacks: removal, obfuscation, and ambiguity attacks. 1. Introduction Recent years have witnessed an increasing demand for protecting deep neural networks (DNNs) as intellectual properties (IPs), mainly due to the significant cost of collecting quality data and training DNNs on it. In response, researchers have proposed various DNN watermarking methods for DNN copyright protection (Uchida et al., 2017; Darvish Rouhani et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018; Fan et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2024; Lim et al., 2022), which work by secretly embedding identity messages into the DNNs during training. The IP holders can present the identity messages to verifier in the event of copyright dispute to claim ownership. 1Department of Artificial Intelligence, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea 2Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Correspondence to: Dokyung Song <dokyungs@yonsei.ac.kr>, Youngjae Yu <youngjae4yu@gmail.com>. Figure 1: Overview of SEAL. (1) We begin with LoRAs weights and B, plus non-trainable passports C, Cp. (2) During training, and Cp are inserted between and A, forcing the model to rely on them and thus entangling the weights with the passports. (3) Afterward, is factorized via (C) = (C1, C2) and merged into and A, resulting in standard-looking LoRA weights and A. Meanwhile, Cp remains private for ownership verification. (Ding et al., 2023) recent Parameter Efficient FineTuning Meanwhile, (PEFT) strategies, particularly Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2022), have revolutionized how many domain-specific DNNs - especially Large Language Models (LLMs) (AI@Meta, 2024; Jiang et al., 2023; Team et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024) and Diffusion Models (DMs) (Rombach et al., 2022) - are built and shared. LoRAs efficacy stems from its lightweight adaptation layers, which introduce no additional inference overhead while preserving similar performance to fully fine-tuned models (Zhao et al., 2024; Jang et al., 2024; Mangrulkar et al., 2022). These qualities have led to surge in open-source adaptation, as evidenced by more than 100k publicly shared LoRA weights on platforms such as Hugging Face, Civit AI (Luo et al., 2024). In addition, several variants such as QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2024), LoRA+ (Hayou et al., 2024), and DoRA (Liu et al., 2024b) have emerged to further optimize resource usage and boost efficient domain adaptation. Due to these factors, LoRAs training framework has been established as the de facto approach in open-source communities for customizing large Preprint version. 1 SEAL: Entangled White-box Watermarks on Low-Rank Adaptation pretrained models to domain-specific tasks. 2. Preliminary Although LoRA-based methods rely on pretrained foundation models, their uniquely trained adaptation weights themselves represent valuable IP that merits protection. Unfortunately, existing white-box DNN watermarking schemes are not suitable for LoRA structure where weights are commonly released in open source, as they only support embedding identity messages in specific architecture-bounded components, such as kernels in convolutional layers (Uchida et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020; Lim et al., 2022). By contrast, some approaches focus on utilizing LoRA to protect the original pretrained weights rather than safeguarding the LoRA itself (Feng et al., 2024), exposing these methods failure to address LoRAs unique properties. To address this gap, we propose SEAL, the universal watermarking scheme designed to protect the copyright of LoRA weights. The key insight of SEAL is the integration of constant matrices, passports, between the LoRA weight, acting as hidden identity message that is difficult to extract, remove, modify, or even counterfeit, thus offering robust IP protection. During fine-tuning, these passports naturally direct gradients through themselves, eliminating the need for additional constraint losses. After fine-tuning, SEAL seamlessly decomposes the passport into two parts, each integrated into the up and down blocks, ensuring the final model is structurally indistinguishable from LoRA weights. We validate our SEAL against an array of attacksremoval (Han et al., 2016), obfuscation (Yan et al., 2023; Pegoraro et al., 2024), and ambiguity (Fan et al., 2019)demonstrating that any attempt to remove or disrupt the passport severely degrades model performance. SEAL imposes no performance degradation on the host task; in many cases, it matches or even surpasses the fidelity of standard LoRA weights across various tasks. In summary, our contributions are three-fold: 1. Simple yet Strong Copyright Protection for LoRA. We present SEAL, the universial watermarking scheme for protecting LoRA weights by embedding hidden identity message using constant matrix, passport, eliminating the need for additional loss terms, offering straightforward yet robust solution. 2. No Performance Degradation. We demonstrate applying SEAL does not degrade the performance of the In practice, SEAL consistently achieves host task. performance comparable to or even exceeding that of standard LoRA. 3. Robustness Against Attacks. We demonstrate SEALs resilience against various attacks, including removal, obfuscation, and ambiguity attacks, maintaining robust IP protection under severe ad"
