Text:": Creating New Games with Generative Interactive Videos Jiwen Yu1 Yiran Qin1 Xintao Wang2 1 The University of Hong Kong Pengfei Wan2 2 Kuaishou Technology Di Zhang2 Xihui Liu1 https://vvictoryuki.github.io/gamefactory/ 5 2 0 2 4 ] . [ 1 5 2 3 8 0 . 1 0 5 2 : r Figure 1. We propose GameFactory, framework that leverages the powerful generative capabilities of pre-trained video models for the creation of new games. By learning action control from small-scale first-person Minecraft dataset, this framework can transfer these control abilities to open-domain videos, ultimately allowing the creation of new games within open-domain scenes. As illustrated in (1)- (4), GameFactory supports action control across diverse, newly generated scenes in open domains, paving the way for the development of entirely new game experiences. The yellow buttons indicate pressed keys, and the arrows represent the direction of mouse movements. "

Generative game engines have the potential to revolutionize game development by autonomously creating new content and reducing manual workload. However, existing video-based game generation methods fail to address the critical challenge of scene generalization, limiting their applicability to existing games with fixed styles and scenes. In this paper, we present GameFactory, a framework focused on exploring scene generalization in game video generation. To enable the creation of entirely new and diverse games, we leverage pre-trained video diffusion models trained on open-domain video data. To bridge the domain gap between open-domain priors and small-scale game dataset, we propose a multi-phase training strategy that decouples game style learning from action control, preserving open-domain generalization while achieving action controllability. Using Minecraft as our data source, we release GF-Minecraft, a high-quality and diversity action-annotated video dataset for research. Furthermore, we extend our framework to enable autoregressive action-controllable game video generation, allowing the production of unlimited-length interactive game videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GameFactory effectively generates open-domain, diverse, and action-controllable game videos, representing a significant step forward in AI-driven game generation. Our dataset and project page are publicly available at https://vvictoryuki.github.io/gamefactory/.
