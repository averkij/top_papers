A generative visual compositing framework using a diffusion model for scene editing and composition with source masking and simulated object jittering.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present BlenderFusion, a generative visual compositing framework that synthesizes new scenes by recomposing objects, camera, and background. It follows a layering-editing-compositing pipeline: (i) segmenting and converting visual inputs into editable 3D entities (layering), (ii) editing them in Blender with 3D-grounded control (editing), and (iii) fusing them into a coherent scene using a generative compositor (compositing). Our generative compositor extends a pre-trained diffusion model to process both the original (source) and edited (target) scenes in parallel. It is fine-tuned on video frames with two key training strategies: (i) source masking, enabling flexible modifications like background replacement; (ii) simulated object jittering, facilitating disentangled control over objects and camera. BlenderFusion significantly outperforms prior methods in complex compositional scene editing tasks.

DenseDiT, a generative model-based approach, achieves superior performance in real-world dense prediction tasks using minimal training data compared to existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Dense prediction tasks hold significant importance of computer vision, aiming to learn pixel-wise annotated label for an input image. Despite advances in this field, existing methods primarily focus on idealized conditions, with limited generalization to real-world scenarios and facing the challenging scarcity of real-world data. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce DenseWorld, a benchmark spanning a broad set of 25 dense prediction tasks that correspond to urgent real-world applications, featuring unified evaluation across tasks. Then, we propose DenseDiT, which maximally exploits generative models' visual priors to perform diverse real-world dense prediction tasks through a unified strategy. DenseDiT combines a parameter-reuse mechanism and two lightweight branches that adaptively integrate multi-scale context, working with less than 0.1% additional parameters. Evaluations on DenseWorld reveal significant performance drops in existing general and specialized baselines, highlighting their limited real-world generalization. In contrast, DenseDiT achieves superior results using less than 0.01% training data of baselines, underscoring its practical value for real-world deployment.

"DenseDiT, a generative model-based approach, achieves superior performance in real-world dense prediction tasks using minimal training data compared to existing methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Dense prediction tasks hold significant importance of computer vision, aiming to learn pixel-wise annotated label for an input image. Despite advances in this field, existing methods primarily focus on idealized conditions, with limited generalization to real-world scenarios and facing the challenging scarcity of real-world data.
