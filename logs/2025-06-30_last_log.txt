TAPAS demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the VirtualHome simulated real-world environment. I. Introduction Adaptability to unforeseen situations and evolving requirements is crucial for effective task planning in unstructured, open-world environments. For instance, dynamic environments require robots to handle incomplete information and changing task specifications. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong generative capabilities, enabling the parsing of natural language into structured problem representations. However, leveraging these capabilities for automated planning remains an open challenge, especially in dynamic environments requiring contextual grounding, adaptability, and reasoning under uncertainty. Classical symbolic planning frameworks, while powerful, face notable limitations. They rely on meticulously defined domain models that require significant human expertise. This makes them rigid and difficult to adapt to novel scenarios, thus limiting their applicability in dynamic, realworld settings. Current LLM-based approaches, conversely, lack the structured reasoning capabilities of symbolic planners. This work addresses the critical need for planning system that combines the strengths of both: the adaptability of LLMs and the rigor of symbolic planning, thereby enhancing trustworthiness. We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), multi-agent framework that bridges natural language understanding and symbolic planning for adaptive task planning.

If goal can be represented with existing predicates, it directly generates and executes plan. Otherwise, TAPAS detects missing predicates, updates the domain model by modifying action constraints, and integrates the new goal before solving. This allows symbolic planners to generalize beyond predefined representations while adapting to evolving task requirements. approaches, TAPAS employs set of specialized LLMbased agents, each responsible for distinct phase of problem formulation: domain modeling, initial state generation, and goal specification. This modular design ensures structured problem representation while allowing flexible adaptation to new task constraints. Using the Unified Planning (UP) framework, TAPAS adaptively updates domain representations through iterative refinement, automatically incorporating novel attributes such as object properties or action constraints. Figure 1 illustrates how TAPAS dynamically adapts domain models to new goal constraints. Key contributions of TAPAS include: 1) An approach to reason over and dynamically adapt to unexpected goal specifications, including those that introduce novel attributes or constraints, without requiring manual domain redefinition. This adaptation is achieved through modular, collaborative framework where LLM agents autonomously generate and update structured domain models, initial states, and goals. 2) robust planning and execution pipeline that bridges the gap between dynamically generated symbolic plans and real-world robot capabilities. This is achieved through natural language translation of plans, ReAct (Reason+Act)-based execution to handle domain-skill discrepancies, and iterative feedbackdriven validation. By leveraging these features, TAPAS provides scalable and adaptive approach to automated planning, addressing traditional barriers in symbolic planning. Its modular The AIPlan4EU Unified Planning Library: https://github.com/ aiplan4eu/unified-planning agent-based design and feedback-driven execution make it well suited for open-world environments where contextual reasoning and adaptability are essential. II. Related Work Effective task planning in dynamic, open-world environments requires reasoning and adaptability, which traditional methods often lack. Recently, LLMs have shown remarkable progress in reasoning, offering new avenues for these challenges. Foundational prompting techniques, such as Chain of Thought (CoT) [1, 2], established that LLMs can perform in-context reasoning. Subsequent methods like Tree of Thoughts (ToT) [3] and Graph of Thoughts (GoT) [4] further enhanced problemsolving by introducing more structured exploration of the solution space. Building on these advancements, LLMs have been directly applied to task planning as planners. Early approaches explored translating high-level language into actionable steps [5] and grounding plans in robotic affordances [6]. To improve robustness, subsequent methods introduced iterative self-refinement through feedback loops [7, 8] and tool-interactive correction [9]. ReAct [10] enables interleaved reasoning and action execution, improving adaptability in dynamic tasks. Other works have focused on grounding plans in 3D scene representations [11], integrating strategic look-ahead with Mont"

Fractional Reasoning dynamically adjusts reasoning depth during inference to enhance the performance of large language models across various tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However, existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g., self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning tasks and models.

TAPAS integrates LLMs with symbolic planning to dynamically adapt and generate domain models, initial states, and goals for complex tasks, achieving strong performance in various environments and with real-world robots.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent, coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.

"TAPAS integrates LLMs with symbolic planning to dynamically adapt and generate domain models, initial states, and goals for complex tasks, achieving strong performance in various environments and with real-world robots.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent, coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the VirtualHome simulated real-world environment."
