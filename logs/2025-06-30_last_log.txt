Text:"Shape-for-Motion: Precise and Consistent Video Editing with 3D Proxy YUHAO LIU, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China TENGFEI WANG, Tencent, China FANG LIU, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China ZHENWEI WANG, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China RYNSON W.H. LAU, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China 5 2 0 2 7 2 ] . [ 1 2 3 4 2 2 . 6 0 5 2 : r Fig. 1. The proposed 3D-aware framework, Shape-for-Motion, supports precise and consistent video editing by reconstructing an editable 3D mesh to serve as control signals for video generation. The first two examples demonstrate pose editing (by rotating the back to the right by 50 degrees and the head to the left by 10 degrees) and object composition (by composing tree from the reference image onto the top of the car). In each example, the first row shows the input video frames, followed by the editing in 3D space at the right end; the bottom row of images shows the corresponding edited frames. In addition, our approach also supports diverse applications, such as Image-to-Video Animation, as shown in the third example. Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented opportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, novel framework that incorporates 3D proxy for precise and consistent video editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the input video to time-consistent mesh, i.e., 3D proxy, allowing edits to be performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To simplify the editing process, we design novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that allows users to perform edits on the 3D "

A novel framework integrates 3D proxy meshes and a decoupled video diffusion model to achieve precise and consistent video editing.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented opportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel framework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the input video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To simplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that allows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits are then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D meshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce the edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a decoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework supports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the video frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture modification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward high-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.

Current multimodal large language models show moderate to poor performance in multimodal in-context learning for medical tasks, with sensitivity to example relevance and ordering.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias, i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks from context.
