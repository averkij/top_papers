Text:"Performance Prediction for Large Systems via Text-to-Text Regression Yash Akhauri1,2, Bryan Lewandowski1, Cheng-Hsi Lin1, Adrian N. Reyes1, Grant C. Forbes3, Arissa Wongpanich1, Bangding Yang1, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah2, Sagi Perel1 and Xingyou Song1 1Google, 2Cornell University, 3North Carolina State University Work performed as student researcher at Google Research. Code: https://github.com/google-deepmind/regress-lm In many industries, predicting metric outcomes of large systems is fundamental problem, driven largely by traditional tabular regression. However, such methods struggle on complex systems data in the wild such as configuration files or system logs, where feature engineering is often infeasible. We propose text-to-text regression as general, scalable alternative. For predicting resource efficiency on Borg, Googles massive compute cluster scheduling system, 60M parameter encoder-decoder, trained from random initialization, achieves up to near perfect 0.99 (0.9 average) rank correlation across the entire fleet, and 100x lower MSE than tabular approaches. The model also easily adapts to new tasks in only 500 few-shot examples and captures the densities of complex outcome distributions. Ablation studies highlight the importance of using encoders, increasing sequence length, and the models inherent uncertainty quantification. These findings pave the way for universal simulators of real-world outcomes. 1. Introduction Performance prediction has been an important problem for various industrial system use cases, ranging from latency prediction (Madhyastha et al., 2006), execution times (Venkataraman et al., 2016), scheduling conflicts (Manousis et al., 2020), and transaction response timing (Stewart et al., 2007). While traditional methods have significantly relied on expert domain knowledge to model specific numeric metrics, more recent data-centric techniques have predominantly used machine-learning based regression methods by training models which predict met"

A hierarchical Bayesian framework explains in-context learning behavior by modeling it as a tradeoff between strategy loss and complexity, offering both explanatory power and predictive insights.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent work analyzing in-context learning (ICL) has identified a broad set of strategies that describe model behavior in different experimental conditions. We aim to unify these findings by asking why a model learns these disparate strategies in the first place. Specifically, we start with the observation that when trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the strategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of Bayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on the set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, where the prior matches the underlying task distribution. Adopting the normative lens of rational analysis, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal adaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next-token predictions throughout training -- without assuming access to its weights. Under this framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior probability of different strategies, and inference-time behavior as a posterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework draws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make explicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies: beyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing a strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL phenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend in the timescale for transitioning from generalization to memorization as task diversity increases. Overall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.

Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS) mitigates activation variance issues in Pre-LayerNorm Transformers and enhances training dynamics across different architectures.  					AI-generated summary 				 Modern Large Language Models, such as the LLaMA, Qwen and DeepSeek series, predominantly adopt the Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While being stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN suffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers, causing the residual path to dominate over sub-layer outputs and limiting the learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate this issue, we propose Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple technique that can be used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works by scaling down the intermediate activations while keeping their gradients unchanged. This leaves information in the activations intact, and avoids the gradient vanishing problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive experiments across various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves consistent performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also shows promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and DeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training dynamics in a wide range of settings.

A text-to-text regression model achieves high accuracy in predicting resource efficiency for Google's Borg system, surpassing tabular methods, and demonstrates adaptability and uncertainty quantification.  					AI-generated summary 				 In many industries, predicting metric outcomes of large systems is a fundamental problem, driven largely by traditional tabular regression. However, such methods struggle on complex systems data in the wild such as configuration files or system logs, where feature engineering is often infeasible. We propose text-to-text regression as a general, scalable alternative. For predicting resource efficiency on Borg, Google's massive compute cluster scheduling system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder, trained from random initialization, achieves up to a near perfect 0.99 (0.9 average) rank correlation across the entire fleet, and 100x lower MSE than tabular approaches. The model also easily adapts to new tasks in only 500 few-shot examples and captures the densities of complex outcome distributions. Ablation studies highlight the importance of using encoders, increasing sequence length, and the model's inherent uncertainty quantification. These findings pave the way for universal simulators of real-world outcomes.

AI-generated summary 				 In many industries, predicting metric outcomes of large systems is a fundamental problem, driven largely by traditional tabular regression.

Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings enable explicit modeling of transitive entailment in vision-language models, leading to improved performance in hierarchical species classification and retrieval tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation model capable of representing the hierarchy in the Tree of Life. Our experiments on hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval tasks demonstrate the enhanced performance of our models compared to the existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and models are open-sourced at https://vishu26.github.io/RCME/index.html.
