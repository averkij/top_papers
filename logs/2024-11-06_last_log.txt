Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization and instruction-following capabilities with instruction tuning. The advancements in LLMs and instruction tuning have led to the development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, the competency of the LLMs and instruction tuning have been less explored in the molecular domain. Thus, we propose LLaMo: Large Language Model-based Molecular graph assistant, which is an end-to-end trained large molecular graph-language model. To bridge the discrepancy between the language and graph modalities, we present the multi-level graph projector that transforms graph representations into graph tokens by abstracting the output representations of each GNN layer and motif representations with the cross-attention mechanism. We also introduce machine-generated molecular graph instruction data to instruction-tune the large molecular graph-language model for general-purpose molecule and language understanding. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaMo shows the best performance on diverse tasks, such as molecular description generation, property prediction, and IUPAC name prediction.

We introduce DreamPolish, a text-to-3D generation model that excels in producing refined geometry and high-quality textures. In the geometry construction phase, our approach leverages multiple neural representations to enhance the stability of the synthesis process. Instead of relying solely on a view-conditioned diffusion prior in the novel sampled views, which often leads to undesired artifacts in the geometric surface, we incorporate an additional normal estimator to polish the geometry details, conditioned on viewpoints with varying field-of-views. We propose to add a surface polishing stage with only a few training steps, which can effectively refine the artifacts attributed to limited guidance from previous stages and produce 3D objects with more desirable geometry. The key topic of texture generation using pretrained text-to-image models is to find a suitable domain in the vast latent distribution of these models that contains photorealistic and consistent renderings. In the texture generation phase, we introduce a novel score distillation objective, namely domain score distillation (DSD), to guide neural representations toward such a domain. We draw inspiration from the classifier-free guidance (CFG) in textconditioned image generation tasks and show that CFG and variational distribution guidance represent distinct aspects in gradient guidance and are both imperative domains for the enhancement of texture quality. Extensive experiments show our proposed model can produce 3D assets with polished surfaces and photorealistic textures, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

In the geometry construction phase, our approach leverages multiple neural representations to enhance the stability of the synthesis process. Instead of relying solely on a view-conditioned diffusion prior in the novel sampled views, which often leads to undesired artifacts in the geometric surface, we incorporate an additional normal estimator to polish the geometry details, conditioned on viewpoints with varying field-of-views. We propose to add a surface polishing stage with only a few training steps, which can effectively refine the artifacts attributed to limited guidance from previous stages and produce 3D objects with more desirable geometry. The key topic of texture generation using pretrained text-to-image models is to find a suitable domain in the vast latent distribution of these models that contains photorealistic and consistent renderings. In the texture generation phase, we introduce a novel score distillation objective, namely domain score distillation (DSD), to guide neural representations toward such a domain. We draw inspiration from the classifier-free guidance (CFG) in textconditioned image generation tasks and show that CFG and variational distribution guidance represent distinct aspects in gradient guidance and are both imperative domains for the enhancement of texture quality. Extensive experiments show our proposed model can produce 3D assets with polished surfaces and photorealistic textures, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods."

Rare diseases present unique challenges in healthcare, often suffering from delayed diagnosis and fragmented information landscapes. The scarcity of reliable knowledge in these conditions poses a distinct challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) in supporting clinical management and delivering precise patient information underscoring the need for focused training on these 'zebra' cases. We present Zebra-Llama, a specialized context-aware language model with high precision Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capability, focusing on Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) as our case study. EDS, affecting 1 in 5,000 individuals, exemplifies the complexities of rare diseases with its diverse symptoms, multiple subtypes, and evolving diagnostic criteria. By implementing a novel context-aware fine-tuning methodology trained on questions derived from medical literature, patient experiences, and clinical resources, along with expertly curated responses, Zebra-Llama demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in handling EDS-related queries. On a test set of real-world questions collected from EDS patients and clinicians, medical experts evaluated the responses generated by both models, revealing Zebra-Llama's substantial improvements over base model (Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct) in thoroughness (77.5% vs. 70.1%), accuracy (83.0% vs. 78.8%), clarity (74.7% vs. 72.0%) and citation reliability (70.6% vs. 52.3%). Released as an open-source resource, Zebra-Llama not only provides more accessible and reliable EDS information but also establishes a framework for developing specialized AI solutions for other rare conditions. This work represents a crucial step towards democratizing expert-level knowledge in rare disease management, potentially transforming how healthcare providers and patients navigate the complex landscape of rare diseases.
