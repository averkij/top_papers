Text:"Rewina Bedemariam1, Natalie Perez1, Sreyoshi Bhaduri, Satya Kapoor, Alex Gil, Elizabeth Conjar, Ikkei Itoku, David Theil, Aman Chadha, Naumaan NayyarRapid advancements in large language models have unlocked remarkable capabilities when it comes to processing and summarizing unstructured text data. This has implications for the analysis of rich, open-ended datasets, such as survey responses, where LLMs hold the promise of efficiently distilling key themes and sentiments. However, as organizations increasingly turn to these powerful AI systems to make sense of textual feedback, critical question arises, can we trust LLMs to accurately represent the perspectives contained within these text based datasets? While LLMs excel at generating human-like summaries, there is risk that their outputs may inadvertently diverge from the true substance of the original responses. Discrepancies between the LLM-generated outputs and the actual themes present in the data could lead to flawed decision-making, with far-reaching consequences for organizations. This research investigates the effectiveness of LLMs as judge models to evaluate the thematic alignment of summaries generated by other LLMs. We utilized an Anthropic Claude model to generate thematic summaries from open-ended survey responses, with Amazon's Titan Express, Nova Pro, and Meta's Llama serving as LLM judges. The LLM-asjudge approach was compared to human evaluations using Cohen's kappa, Spearman's rho, and Krippendorff's alpha, validating scalable alternative to traditional human centric evaluation methods. Our findings reveal that while LLMs as judges offer scalable solution comparable to human raters, humans may still excel at detecting subtle, contextspecific nuances. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI assisted text analysis. We discuss limitations and provide recommendations for future research, emphasizing the need for careful consideration when generalizing LLM judge models across various contexts and use cases. 1. Introduction The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has expanded their potential uses, from generating content to assessing it. As organizations increasingly adopt these models, there is growing need to evaluate the accuracy and alignment of LLM-generated outputs with human perspectives (Long et al., 2024). The concept of using LLMs as evaluative judges dates back to efforts in natural language processing to improve evaluation metrics such as BLEU or ROUGE, which primarily measure word overlap (Wang et al., 2024). However, these traditional evaluation metrics often fall short when it comes to accurately assessing the nuances of natural language generation tasks (Liu et al., 2023). As LLMs increasingly power the analysis of open-ended textual data in organizational settings, ensuring the fairness and accuracy of their outputs becomes crucial. In artificial intelligence, model alignment refers to techniques designed to align LLM behaviors with human values and expectations (Shen et al., 2023). This involves methods like fine-tuning, human feedback, and reinforcement learning to ensure outputs reflect human-like reasoning and decision-making processes (Liu et al., 2024). Model alignment is critical, especially when models like Anthropic Claude are used as judge models in behavioral research (Shen et al., 2023). Our research makes significant contribution by investigating the effectiveness of using LLMs as judges to evaluate the thematic alignment of summaries generated by other LLMs, specifically in the context of organizations using open-text survey responses. Our study is important because it addresses critical gap in the responsible deployment of AI systems for decision-making processes that directly impact organizational decision-making. We employed an Anthropic Claude model to generate thematic summaries from open-ended survey responses and utilized Amazons Titan Express and Nova Pro LLMs and Llama as judges to evaluate these summaries. By comparing the LLM-as-judge approach with human evaluations using Cohen's kappa, Spearmans rho, and Krippendorffs alpha, we present scalable alternative to traditional human-centric evaluation methods. This research is particularly relevant to the AI in Talent Management research community, as it explores the potential for AI systems to serve as impartial arbiters of content accuracy and representation, while also highlighting the ethical considerations and potential biases inherent in such approaches. Our findings demonstrate that LLM judges can produce results comparable to human raters, offering organizations more efficient means of validating AI-generated insights. However, we also critically examine the limitations of this approach and provide recommendations for future research to ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency in the use of LLMs for organizational decision-making. This work 1 Both authors contributed equally to this work. 1 contributes to the ongoing dialogue on responsible AI deployment and the development of trustworthy evaluation mechanisms for AI-generated content in high-stakes environments. The following research questions are explored: 1) To what extent can LLMs replicate human judgment in evaluating thematic alignment, and what factors contribute to discrepancies between LLM and human ratings? 2) What are the implications of higher inter-model agreement compared to human-model agreement for the development and application of LLMs in similar content analysis and theme evaluation tasks? 2. Background "LLM-as-a-judge" has emerged as an innovative solution, wherein an LLM evaluates another models output to approximate human labeling (Zheng et al., 2023). This approach offers the promise of automating human judgment at scale, while maintaining high levels of reliability and consistency. For example, Yan (2024) demonstrated that, when properly calibrated, LLMs can reach agreement rates close to those of human annotators, which can be costly and time-intensive. From this lens, the utilization of LLMs can significantly reduce analysis time and turn around rapid results. By comparing an LLM's evaluation of generated content to human evaluations, researchers aim to refine LLM capabilities and ensure alignment with human interpretations (Rao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024).This approach could simplify the evaluation process by reducing reliance on human resources, enabling faster iterations in development cycles."

"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their success heavily relies on the quality of pretraining corpora. For Chinese LLMs, the scarcity of high-quality Chinese datasets presents a significant challenge, often limiting their performance. To address this issue, we propose the OpenCSG Chinese Corpus, a series of high-quality datasets specifically designed for LLM pretraining, post-training, and fine-tuning. This corpus includes Fineweb-edu-chinese, Fineweb-edu-chinese-v2, Cosmopedia-chinese, and Smoltalk-chinese, each with distinct characteristics: Fineweb-edu datasets focus on filtered, high-quality content derived from diverse Chinese web sources; Cosmopedia-chinese provides synthetic, textbook-style data for knowledge-intensive training; and Smoltalk-chinese emphasizes stylistic and diverse chat-format data. The OpenCSG Chinese Corpus is characterized by its high-quality text, diverse coverage across domains, and scalable, reproducible data curation processes. Additionally, we conducted extensive experimental analyses, including evaluations on smaller parameter models, which demonstrated significant performance improvements in tasks such as C-Eval, showcasing the effectiveness of the corpus for training Chinese LLMs."

Rapid advancements in large language models have unlocked remarkable capabilities when it comes to processing and summarizing unstructured text data. This has implications for the analysis of rich, open-ended datasets, such as survey responses, where LLMs hold the promise of efficiently distilling key themes and sentiments. However, as organizations increasingly turn to these powerful AI systems to make sense of textual feedback, a critical question arises, can we trust LLMs to accurately represent the perspectives contained within these text based datasets? While LLMs excel at generating human-like summaries, there is a risk that their outputs may inadvertently diverge from the true substance of the original responses. Discrepancies between the LLM-generated outputs and the actual themes present in the data could lead to flawed decision-making, with far-reaching consequences for organizations. This research investigates the effectiveness of LLMs as judge models to evaluate the thematic alignment of summaries generated by other LLMs. We utilized an Anthropic Claude model to generate thematic summaries from open-ended survey responses, with Amazon's Titan Express, Nova Pro, and Meta's Llama serving as LLM judges. The LLM-as-judge approach was compared to human evaluations using Cohen's kappa, Spearman's rho, and Krippendorff's alpha, validating a scalable alternative to traditional human centric evaluation methods. Our findings reveal that while LLMs as judges offer a scalable solution comparable to human raters, humans may still excel at detecting subtle, context-specific nuances. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI assisted text analysis. We discuss limitations and provide recommendations for future research, emphasizing the need for careful consideration when generalizing LLM judge models across various contexts and use cases.
