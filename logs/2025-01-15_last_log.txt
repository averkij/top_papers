All rights reserved MiniMax-01: Scaling Foundation Models with Lightning Attention 1. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) (Anthropic, 2024; Dubey et al., 2024; Hurst et al., 2024; Team et al., 2024a) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) (Anthropic, 2024; Dubey et al., 2024; Hurst et al., 2024; Team et al., 2024a) have made rapid progress in recent years, excelling at tasks like knowledge Q&A, complex reasoning, mathematics, coding, and vision-language understanding. The context window for most models currently ranges from 32K to 256K tokens. However, these lengths often fall short of practical needswhether using professional book as context, assisting with an entire programming project, or maximizing the potential of in-context learning through many-shot examples. Context window expansion in the past two years has primarily resulted from more powerful GPUs and better I/O-aware softmax attention implementation (Dao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2024a). However, extending these windows further has proven challenging. This limitation arises from the inherent quadratic computational complexity of the transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) architecturefurther length extension causes computational demands to grow much faster than hardware capabilities can match. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed various methods for reducing the attention mechanisms computational complexity: sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020), linear attention (Qin et al., 2022a,b, 2024c), long convolutions (Qin et al., 2023a), state space models (the Mamba series) (Dao and Gu, 2024; Glorioso et al., 2024; Gu and Dao, 2024; Ren et al., 2024; Team et al., 2024b), and linear RNNs (Qin et al., 2023b, 2024d). Despite their theoretical promise, these innovations have seen limited adoption in commercial-scale models. In this report, we aim to build model that matches the performance of leading commercial models while providing context window longer by an order of magnitude. This ambitious objective requires carefully balancing multiple factors: network architecture, data, and computation. Our approach begins with selecting the most promising architecture, succeeded by the optimization of the underlying training and inference framework to ensure its support. For the network architecture, we required linear attentionnot just theoretically sound but highly efficient in practice, especially with long contexts. After extensive experimentation, we settled on hybrid architecture mainly using lightning attention (Qin et al., 2024b), an I/O-aware implementation of linear attention variant (Qin et al., 2022a). In the architecture, one transformer block with softmax attention follows every seven transnormer blocks (Qin et al., 2022a) with lightning attention. We determined the models total parameters based on practical constraint: the ability to process more than 1 million tokens on single machine with up to 8 GPUs and 640GB memory using 8-bit quantization. To maximize parameter and computation capacity, we implemented Mixture of Experts (MoE) (Fedus et al., 2022; Lepikhin et al., 2021). We comprehensively consider training resources, inference resources, and the final model performance, aiming to find better balance among the three. Extensive experiments guided us toward the final model specifications: 456 billion parameters, 45.9 billion activations, and 32 experts. Existing distributed training and inference frameworks are primarily optimized for softmax attention. However, our novel architecture, which integrates lightning attention, softmax attention, and MoE, necessitates complete redesign of both our training and inference frameworks. Furthermore, the framework must possess the capability to support the training and inference of models with hundreds of billions of parameters and context windows extending over millions of tokens. To this end, we implement the all-to-all communication in MoE using expert parallel (EP) and expert tensor parallel (ETP). It aims to minimize the overhead associated with inter-GPU communication. To facilitate context windows with unlimited expansion, we design varlen ring attention to reduce the redundancy in computation and the improved version of Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism (LASP) (Sun et al., 2024) to fully utilize the devices parallel capabilities. Additionally, we have implemented 2 MiniMax-01: Scaling Foundation Models with Lightning Attention comprehensive set of CUDA kernels tailored for lightning attention inference, achieving over 75% Model Flops Utilization (MFU) (Chowdhery et al., 2023) end-to-end on the Nvidia H20.

Text:"Diffusion Adversarial Post-Training for One-Step Video Generation Shanchuan Lin* Xin Xia Yuxi Ren Ceyuan Yang Xuefeng Xiaohttps://seaweed-apt.comThe diffusion models are widely used for image and video generation, but their iterative generation process is slow and expansive. While existing distillation approaches have demonstrated the potential for one-step generation in the they still suffer from significant quality image domain, degradation. In this work, we propose Adversarial PostTraining (APT) against real data following diffusion pre- *peterlin@bytedance.com training for one-step video generation. To improve the training stability and quality, we introduce several improvements to the model architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1 regularization objective. Empirically, our experiments show that our adversarial post-trained model, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280720, 24fps videos in real time using single forward evaluation step. Additionally, our model is capable of generating 1024px images in single step, achieving quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods. 1 1. Introduction The diffusion method [21, 65] has become the de facto standard for learning large-scale image generation [1, 7, 13, 14, 49, 52, 54, 56] and video generation [2, 4, 31, 50, 72, 85]. Reducing the generation cost is an important research area in diffusion methods. Among the various methods proposed, diffusion step distillation has emerged as an effective approach to reduce the inference step. Generally, these methods start with pre-trained diffusion model as teacher that generates targets through multiple diffusion inference steps. They then apply knowledge distillation [19] to train student model that can replicate the teachers output using much fewer diffusion inference steps. Previous methods [6, 35, 40, 41, 53, 57, 59, 60, 64, 66, 79] focus on preserving the generative distribution of the diffusion teacher while reducing inference steps. One-step generation is often considered the pinnacle of diffusion step distillation, yet it presents the most significant challenges. It deviates from the fundamental principle of diffusion models, which rely on iterative denoising steps to uncover the data distribution. While previous research has demonstrated notable advancements for generating images in single step with promising results [6, 35, 40, 53, 60, 64, 66, 79], producing high-quality images in one step remains challenging, particularly in achieving fine-grained details, minimizing artifacts, and preserving the structural integrity. Accelerated video generation, however, has seen limited progress in the literature. Early efforts utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs) [16], e.g. StyleGAN-V [63] can only generate domain-specific data with poor quality in modern standards. With the rise of diffusion methods, recent studies have begun exploring the extension of image distillation techniques to video diffusion models. However, earlier works [33, 70, 83] have only explored distillation on small-scale and low-resolution video models [17, 71] that only generate 512512 videos for total of 16 frames. concurrent work [80] has attempted distillation of largescale video models at 640352 12fps. These methods still generally need 4 diffusion steps. Given the prohibitive computational cost associated with high-resolution video generation, e.g., generating just few seconds of 1280720 24fps videos can take multiple minutes even on the stateof-the-art GPUs like the H100, our work aims at generating high-resolution videos in single step. In this paper, we introduce new approach for onestep image and video generation. Our method utilizes pre-trained diffusion model, specifically the diffusion transformer (DiT) [48], as initialization, and continues training the DiT using the adversarial training objective against real data. It is important to notice the contrast to existing diffusion distillation methods, which use pre-trained diffusion model as distillation teacher to generate the target. Instead, our method performs adversarial training of the DiT directly on real data, using the pre-trained diffusion model only for initialization. We term this method Adversarial Post-Training or APT, as it parallels supervised fine-tuning commonly performed during the post-training stage. Empirically, we observe that APT provides two benefits. First, APT eliminates the substantial cost associated with precomputing video samples from the diffusion teacher. Second, unlike diffusion distillation, where the quality is inherently constrained by the diffusion teacher, APT demonstrates the ability to surpass the teacher by large margin in some evaluation criteria, in particular, improving realism, resolving exposure issues, and enhancing fine details. Direct adversarial training on diffusion models is highly unstable and prone to collapse, particularly in our case, where both the generator and discriminator are exceptionally large transformer models, each containing billions of parameters. To tackle this issue, our method introduces several key designs to stabilize training. It incorporates generator initialized through deterministic distillation and introduces several enhancements to the discriminator, including transformer-based architectural changes, discriminator ensemble across timesteps, and an approximated R1 regularization loss to facilitate large-scale training. By virtue of APT, we have trained what may be one of the largest GAN ever reported to date (16B), capable of generating both images and videos with single forward evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that our model achieves overall performance comparable to state-of-the-art one-step image generation methods, as evaluated through the user study based on three key metrics: visual fidelity, structural integrity, and text alignment. More importantly, to the best of our knowledge, our model is the first to demonstrate high-resolution video generation in single step (1280720 24fps), surpassing the previous state-ofthe-art, which generates 512512 or 640352 up to 12fps videos in four steps. On H100 GPU, our model can generate two-second 1280720 24fps video latent using single step in two seconds. On 8H100 GPUs with parallelization, the entire pipeline with text encoder and latent decoder runs in real time. 2. Related Works Accelerating Diffusion Models.

"We introduce MiniMax-01 series, including MiniMax-Text-01 and MiniMax-VL-01, which are comparable to top-tier models while offering superior capabilities in processing longer contexts. The core lies in lightning attention and its efficient scaling. To maximize computational capacity, we integrate it with Mixture of Experts (MoE), creating a model with 32 experts and 456 billion total parameters, of which 45.9 billion are activated for each token. We develop an optimized parallel strategy and highly efficient computation-communication overlap techniques for MoE and lightning attention. This approach enables us to conduct efficient training and inference on models with hundreds of billions of parameters across contexts spanning millions of tokens. The context window of MiniMax-Text-01 can reach up to 1 million tokens during training and extrapolate to 4 million tokens during inference at an affordable cost. Our vision-language model, MiniMax-VL-01 is built through continued training with 512 billion vision-language tokens. Experiments on both standard and in-house benchmarks show that our models match the performance of state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering 20-32 times longer context window. We publicly release MiniMax-01 at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI."

Large language models excel at interpreting complex natural language instructions, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks. In the life sciences, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data serves as the "language of cellular biology", capturing intricate gene expression patterns at the single-cell level. However, interacting with this "language" through conventional tools is often inefficient and unintuitive, posing challenges for researchers. To address these limitations, we present InstructCell, a multi-modal AI copilot that leverages natural language as a medium for more direct and flexible single-cell analysis. We construct a comprehensive multi-modal instruction dataset that pairs text-based instructions with scRNA-seq profiles from diverse tissues and species. Building on this, we develop a multi-modal cell language architecture capable of simultaneously interpreting and processing both modalities. InstructCell empowers researchers to accomplish critical tasks-such as cell type annotation, conditional pseudo-cell generation, and drug sensitivity prediction-using straightforward natural language commands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that InstructCell consistently meets or exceeds the performance of existing single-cell foundation models, while adapting to diverse experimental conditions. More importantly, InstructCell provides an accessible and intuitive tool for exploring complex single-cell data, lowering technical barriers and enabling deeper biological insights.

The diffusion models are widely used for image and video generation, but their iterative generation process is slow and expansive. While existing distillation approaches have demonstrated the potential for one-step generation in the image domain, they still suffer from significant quality degradation. In this work, we propose Adversarial Post-Training (APT) against real data following diffusion pre-training for one-step video generation. To improve the training stability and quality, we introduce several improvements to the model architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1 regularization objective. Empirically, our experiments show that our adversarial post-trained model, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280x720, 24fps videos in real time using a single forward evaluation step. Additionally, our model is capable of generating 1024px images in a single step, achieving quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.
