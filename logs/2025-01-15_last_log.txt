Text:"POKERBENCH: Training Large Language Models to become Professional Poker Players Richard Zhuang1, Akshat Gupta1*, Richard Yang1, Aniket Rahane1, Zhengyu Li2, Gopala Anumanchipalli1 1University of California, Berkeley; 2Georgia Institute of Technology 5 2 0 2 4 1 ] . [ 1 8 2 3 8 0 . 1 0 5 2 : r Abstract We introduce POKERBENCH - benchmark for evaluating the poker-playing abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs excel in traditional NLP tasks, their application to complex, strategic games like poker poses new challenge. Poker, an incomplete information game, demands multitude of skills such as mathematics, reasoning, planning, strategy, and deep understanding of game theory and human psychology. This makes Poker the ideal next frontier for large language models. POKERBENCH consists of comprehensive compilation of 11,000 most important scenarios, split between pre-flop and post-flop play, developed in collaboration with trained poker players. We evaluate prominent models including GPT-4, ChatGPT 3.5, and various Llama and Gemma series models, finding that all state-of-the-art LLMs underperform in playing optimal poker. However, after finetuning, these models show marked improvements. We validate POKERBENCH by having models with different scores compete with each other, demonstrating that higher scores on POKERBENCH lead to higher win rates in actual poker games. Through gameplay between our fine-tuned model and GPT-4, we also identify limitations of simple supervised finetuning for learning optimal playing strategy, suggesting the need for more advanced methodologies for effectively training language models to excel in games. POKERBENCH thus presents unique benchmark for quick and reliable evaluation of the poker-playing ability of LLMs as well as comprehensive benchmark to study the progress of LLMs in complex game-playing scenarios.

Text:"Tarsier2: Advancing Large Vision-Language Models from Detailed Video Description to Comprehensive Video Understanding Liping Yuan Jiawei Wang Haomiao Sun Yuchen Zhang Yuan Lin ByteDance Research {yuanliping.0o0,wangjiawei.424,sunhaomiao,zhangyuchen.zyc,lingyuan.0}@bytedance.com Abstract We introduce Tarsier2, state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM) designed for generating detailed and accurate video descriptions, while also exhibiting superior general video understanding capabilities. Tarsier2 achieves significant advancements through three key upgrades: (1) Scaling pre-training data from 11M to 40M video-text pairs, enriching both volume and diversity; (2) Performing fine-grained temporal alignment during supervised fine-tuning; (3) Using model-based sampling to automatically construct preference data and applying DPO training for optimization. Extensive experiments show that Tarsier2-7B consistently outperforms leading proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, in detailed video description tasks. On the DREAM-1K benchmark, Tarsier2-7B improves F1 by 2.8% over GPT-4o and 5.8% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. In human side-by-side evaluations, Tarsier2-7B shows +8.6% performance advantage over GPT-4o and +24.9% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. Tarsier2-7B also sets new stateof-the-art results across 15 public benchmarks, spanning tasks such as video question-answering, video grounding, hallucination test, and embodied question-answering, demonstrating its versatility as robust generalist vision-language model.

We introduce Tarsier2, a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM) designed for generating detailed and accurate video descriptions, while also exhibiting superior general video understanding capabilities. Tarsier2 achieves significant advancements through three key upgrades: (1) Scaling pre-training data from 11M to 40M video-text pairs, enriching both volume and diversity; (2) Performing fine-grained temporal alignment during supervised fine-tuning; (3) Using model-based sampling to automatically construct preference data and applying DPO training for optimization. Extensive experiments show that Tarsier2-7B consistently outperforms leading proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, in detailed video description tasks. On the DREAM-1K benchmark, Tarsier2-7B improves F1 by 2.8\% over GPT-4o and 5.8\% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. In human side-by-side evaluations, Tarsier2-7B shows a +8.6\% performance advantage over GPT-4o and +24.9\% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. Tarsier2-7B also sets new state-of-the-art results across 15 public benchmarks, spanning tasks such as video question-answering, video grounding, hallucination test, and embodied question-answering, demonstrating its versatility as a robust generalist vision-language model.
