Text:"Table-R1: Inference-Time Scaling for Table Reasoning Zheyuan Yang* Lyuhao Chen Arman Cohan Yilun Zhao5 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 1 1 2 6 3 2 . 5 0 5 2 : r aIn this work, we present the first study to explore inference-time scaling on table reasoning tasks. We develop and evaluate two post-training strategies to enable inferencetime scaling: distillation from frontier model reasoning traces and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). For distillation, we introduce large-scale dataset of reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek-R1, which we use to fine-tune LLMs into the Table-R1SFT model. For RLVR, we propose taskspecific verifiable reward functions and apply the GRPO algorithm to obtain the TableR1-Zero model. We evaluate our Table-R1series models across diverse table reasoning tasks, including short-form QA, fact verification, and free-form QA. Notably, the TableR1-Zero model matches or exceeds the performance of GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1, while using only 7B-parameter LLM. It also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain datasets. Extensive ablation and qualitative analyses reveal the benefits of instruction tuning, model architecture choices, and cross-task generalization, as well as emergence of essential table reasoning skills during RL training.huggingface.co/Table-R1 github.com/Table-RReasoning large language models, such as OpenAIs o-series (Jaech et al., 2024; Pfister and Jud, 2025) and Deepseeks R1 (Guo et al., 2025), have demonstrated enhanced reasoning capabilities by inference-time scaling, i.e., generating reasoning chain of tokens that allow the model to think before giving the final answer. Building on this success, recent research has extended inferencetime scaling to various domains and tasks, including multimodal reasoning (Huang et al., 2025a; *Equal Contributions. Figure 1: Overall performance comparison between Table-R1 and same-scale baselines on various table reasoning benchmarks. Both Table-R1-SFT and TableR1-Zero exhibit substantial performance improvements over baselines, showing the effectiveness of our approach across both inand out-of-domain benchmarks. Xu et al., 2025), machine translation (Feng et al., 2025b), agent-based tool use (Ouyang et al., 2025; Jin et al., 2025), and information retrieval (Weller et al., 2025; Zhuang et al., 2025). However, applying inference-time scaling to structure-dependent tasksparticularly table reasoningremains largely unexplored. Table reasoning presents distinct challenges compared to text-only tasks: it requires interpreting diverse cell contents, aligning data across the table, and performing multi-step reasoning with aggregation and numerical operations (Deng et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2025). These requirements are further complicated by the need to process long and densely structured tabular inputs (Zhao et al., 2023c; Nahid and Rafiei, 2024; Zhang et al., 2025b). Advancing LLMs reasoning capabilities over tabular tasks holds significant promise for real-world applications, including data analysis (Zhao et al., 2024c), scientific reporting (Liang et al., 2024; Newman et al., 2024), and decision-support systems (Handler et al., 2024). In this work, we present the first study to explore inference-time scaling on table reasoning tasks. Figure 2 presents the overview of our research. We develop and systematically evaluate two widely used post-training strategies to enable inference-time scaling on table reasoning tasks: (1) distilling from reasoning traces of frontier reasoning models, and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). For the distillation approach, we curate and open-source large-scale table reasoning dataset containing reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek-R1 and verifid by LLMbased annotators. We fine-tune LLMs on this data to obtain Table-R1-SFT. For the RLVR approach, we design task-specific, verifiable reward functions tailored to table reasoning and apply the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm (Shao et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025) to enable stable and scalable reinforcement learning. This yields the Table-R1-Zero model. We evaluate Table-R1-series models on wide range of table reasoning tasks, including short-form table QA, fact verification, and free-form table QA. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of inference-time scaling for table reasoning. The RLVR approach, in particular, exhibits better performance and generalization capabilities, compared to the distillation approach. Notably, our Table-R1-Zero models achieve performance that is competitive with advanced language models such as GPT 4.1 and DeepSeek R1, despite using only 7B-parameter LLM (i.e., Qwen2.5-7B) as the backbone. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies on instruction tuning benefits, model family comparisons, and cross-task generalization, providing insights for future applications of inferencetime scaling in table reasoning. Our qualitative analysis of model responses reveals that TableR1-Zero not only acquires multi-step reasoning and reflection abilities like other reasoning models, but also develops essential table-specific reasoning skills such as semantic understanding, information extraction, and arithmetic computation.2.1 Inference-Time Scaling Recently, OpenAIs o1 has demonstrated that scaling inference-time computation can significantly Figure 2: An overview of our research and three research questions investigated in this study. enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks (Jaech et al., 2024). To leverage this, various inference-time strategies have been explored, including the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for exploring diverse reasoning trajectories (Feng et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2024; Guan et al., 2025) and process reward models (PRMs) that offer step-level feedback to guide model outputs (Lightman et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2024). In parallel, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces has emerged as practical post-training method, enabling LLMs to better align generation with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning patterns (Wen et al., 2025; Muennighoff et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2025). Beyond supervised approaches, recent work has introduced reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) as promising post-training paradigm for LLM reasoning (Guo et al., 2025; Team et al., 2025; Team, 2025). In this setting, models are directly optimized with rule-based rewards, allowing them to autonomously "

Autoregressive unified models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, unified discrete diffusion transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch, Muddit integrates strong visual priors from pretrained text-to-image backbone with lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal generation under unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual priors, as scalable and effective backbone for unified generation. The code and model are available at https://github.com/M-E-AGI-Lab/Muddit.Multimodal generative models capable of handling both text and images have rapidly advanced, typically relying on large autoregressive (AR) Transformers, also known as large language models (LLMs) [52]. These unified models represent both modalities as token sequences and generate outputs in left-to-right autoregressive manner. However, this sequential decoding imposes major inference bottleneck. For instance, in early unified transformers [46], as illustrated in Fig. 1(a), generating single image requires sampling thousands of visual tokens one at time. Despite strong correlation among adjacent image tokens, each token prediction triggers full network forward, resulting in significant redundant computation. As result, inference becomes extremely slow and compute-intensive. We refer to this as the first dark cloud over current unified generative models. Moreover, AR decoding enforces rigid generation order. This prevents speed-quality trade-offs or flexible conditional generation like inpainting without fine-tuning, which severely limits practical applicability in interactive or real-time scenarios. To mitigate these limitations, some hybrid approaches [9, 11, 41], adopt AR language models paired with diffusion-based image synthesis heads (Fig. 1(b)). However, these glue architectures fall short of true unification, as they lack shared generative modeling paradigm across modalities. Recent work like Dual-Diffusion [29] (Fig. 1(c)) claims to unify modalities under discrete diffusion, but it ultimately relies on continuous diffusion for image generation via Stable Diffusion 3, 1Peking University, 2TeleAI, China Telecom, 3National University of Singapore, 4Princeton University (cid:66): jinbin.bai@u.nus.edu Preprint. Under review. Figure 1: Four types of unified generative models. More details can be found in Sec. 2. continuous diffusion paradigm. This fundamental mismatch in generative principles undermines its claim of true unification. UniDisc [48](Fig. 1(d)), takes more promising step by applying discrete diffusion1 over unified token spaces. This allows parallel refinement of text and image tokens, improving inference efficiency and enabling more flexible conditioning. However, the overall generation quality of UniDisc remains far from satisfactory. For example, it struggles to produce high-resolution 1024 1024 images, fails to match the fidelity of early diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5, and lacks support for vision-language reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA). These limitations expose the second dark cloud: the absence of strong pretrained discrete diffusion backbone models: Unlike established unified autoregressive models that leverage powerful pretrained large language models, current unified discrete diffusion models are typically trained from scratch on mixed-modality tokens, which limits both their generative fidelity and transferability. Without modular components carrying rich pixel-level priors, these models face generalization and scalability bottlenecks. Taken together, the two dark clouds: inefficient autoregressive sampling and the lack of strong pretrained foundations, highlight the need for new generation of unified models. In this work, we present Muddit, MaskGIT-style unified discrete diffusion transformer equipped with lightweight text decoder. By combining the strengths of parallel discrete diffusion and semantically rich image priors from pre-trained Meissonic text-to-image backbone [5], Muddit enables scalable, efficient, and flexible sampling while significantly improving alignment and quality across modalities and various tasks such as high-resolution text-to-image synthesis, image-to-text synthesis, and visual question answering. We systematically detail the training objective of unified discrete diffusion models, the masking strategy, and the shared inference sampling strategy across three tasks. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations with current popular unified models on several benchmarks, including GenEval, CIDEr, VQAv2, MME, and GQA, demonstrating Muddits superior performance and efficiency, validating that the unexplored purely discrete diffusion approach can rival, or even surpass, much larger autoregressive-based unified models. While concurrent unified generation models [57] often build upon language modeling priorleveraging pretrained dLLMs as the backbonewe instead take visual-first approach. Muddit is built upon an image generation prior, offering new path toward unifying vision and language tasks within discrete diffusion framework. We hope that this work inspires new trend for unified generative modeling, grounded in discrete diffusion, beyond the boundaries of traditional text-to-image synthesis [5] and text synthesis [25, 39].2.1 Unified Models For Generation and Understanding The success of LLMs in language modeling has inspired efforts to extend unified generation to multimodal domains.

Abstract Theorem proving serves as major testbed for evaluating complex reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs). However, traditional automated theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that poorly align with LLMs strength derived from informal, natural language knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise novel reinforcement learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving, leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving"

AnySplat is a feed forward network that performs novel view synthesis without camera poses, using 3D Gaussian primitives and unified design for efficiency and quality across sparse and dense datasets.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce AnySplat, a feed forward network for novel view synthesis from uncalibrated image collections. In contrast to traditional neural rendering pipelines that demand known camera poses and per scene optimization, or recent feed forward methods that buckle under the computational weight of dense views, our model predicts everything in one shot. A single forward pass yields a set of 3D Gaussian primitives encoding both scene geometry and appearance, and the corresponding camera intrinsics and extrinsics for each input image. This unified design scales effortlessly to casually captured, multi view datasets without any pose annotations. In extensive zero shot evaluations, AnySplat matches the quality of pose aware baselines in both sparse and dense view scenarios while surpassing existing pose free approaches. Moreover, it greatly reduce rendering latency compared to optimization based neural fields, bringing real time novel view synthesis within reach for unconstrained capture settings.Project page: https://city-super.github.io/anysplat/

Two post-training strategies, distillation and RLVR, enable inference-time scaling in table reasoning tasks, resulting in a model (Table-R1-Zero) that matches GPT-4.1's performance using fewer parameters and shows strong generalization.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this work, we present the first study to explore inference-time scaling on table reasoning tasks. We develop and evaluate two post-training strategies to enable inference-time scaling: distillation from frontier model reasoning traces and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). For distillation, we introduce a large-scale dataset of reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek-R1, which we use to fine-tune LLMs into the Table-R1-SFT model. For RLVR, we propose task-specific verifiable reward functions and apply the GRPO algorithm to obtain the Table-R1-Zero model. We evaluate our Table-R1-series models across diverse table reasoning tasks, including short-form QA, fact verification, and free-form QA. Notably, the Table-R1-Zero model matches or exceeds the performance of GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1, while using only a 7B-parameter LLM. It also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain datasets. Extensive ablation and qualitative analyses reveal the benefits of instruction tuning, model architecture choices, and cross-task generalization, as well as emergence of essential table reasoning skills during RL training.

A new benchmark, VideoReasonBench, evaluates complex vision-centric video reasoning, finding that extended thinking budgets are crucial for improved performance compared to existing benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent studies have shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can significantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. However, this benefit is yet to be demonstrated in the domain of video understanding, since most existing benchmarks lack the reasoning depth required to demonstrate the advantages of extended CoT chains. While recent efforts have proposed benchmarks aimed at video reasoning, the tasks are often knowledge-driven and do not rely heavily on visual content. To bridge this gap, we introduce VideoReasonBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate vision-centric, complex video reasoning. To ensure visual richness and high reasoning complexity, each video in VideoReasonBench depicts a sequence of fine-grained operations on a latent state that is only visible in part of the video. The questions evaluate three escalating levels of video reasoning skills: recalling observed visual information, inferring the content of latent states, and predicting information beyond the video. Under such task setting, models have to precisely recall multiple operations in the video, and perform step-by-step reasoning to get correct final answers for these questions. Using VideoReasonBench, we comprehensively evaluate 18 state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), finding that most perform poorly on complex video reasoning, e.g., GPT-4o achieves only 6.9% accuracy, while the thinking-enhanced Gemini-2.5-Pro significantly outperforms others with 56.0% accuracy. Our investigations on "test-time scaling" further reveal that extended thinking budget, while offering none or minimal benefits on existing video benchmarks, is essential for improving the performance on VideoReasonBench.

"A new benchmark, VideoReasonBench, evaluates complex vision-centric video reasoning, finding that extended thinking budgets are crucial for improved performance compared to existing benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent studies have shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can significantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. However, this benefit is yet to be demonstrated in the domain of video understanding, since most existing benchmarks lack the reasoning depth required to demonstrate the advantages of extended CoT chains. While recent efforts have proposed benchmarks aimed at video reasoning, the tasks are often knowledge-driven and do not rely heavily on visual content. To bridge this gap, we introduce VideoReasonBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate vision-centric, complex video reasoning. To ensure visual richness and high reasoning complexity, each video in VideoReasonBench depicts a sequence of fine-grained operations on a latent state that is only visible in part of the video. The questions evaluate three escalating levels of video reasoning skills: recalling observed visual information, inferring the content of latent states, and predicting information beyond the video. Under such task setting, models have to precisely recall multiple operations in the video, and perform step-by-step reasoning to get correct final answers for these questions. Using VideoReasonBench, we comprehensively evaluate 18 state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), finding that most perform poorly on complex video reasoning, e.g., GPT-4o achieves only 6.9% accuracy, while the thinking-enhanced Gemini-2.5-Pro significantly outperforms others with 56.0% accuracy. Our investigations on "test-time scaling" further reveal that extended thinking budget, while offering none or minimal benefits on existing video benchmarks, is essential for improving the performance on VideoReasonBench."

Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer, achieves fast and high-quality generation across text and image modalities by integrating pretrained visual priors with a lightweight text decoder.  					AI-generated summary 				 Unified generation models aim to handle diverse tasks across modalities -- such as text generation, image generation, and vision-language reasoning -- within a single architecture and decoding paradigm. Autoregressive unified models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch, Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.

GeoDrive integrates robust 3D geometry into driving world models to improve spatial understanding and action controllability in autonomous navigation, enhancing safety and reliability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in world models have revolutionized dynamic environment simulation, allowing systems to foresee future states and assess potential actions. In autonomous driving, these capabilities help vehicles anticipate the behavior of other road users, perform risk-aware planning, accelerate training in simulation, and adapt to novel scenarios, thereby enhancing safety and reliability. Current approaches exhibit deficiencies in maintaining robust 3D geometric consistency or accumulating artifacts during occlusion handling, both critical for reliable safety assessment in autonomous navigation tasks. To address this, we introduce GeoDrive, which explicitly integrates robust 3D geometry conditions into driving world models to enhance spatial understanding and action controllability. Specifically, we first extract a 3D representation from the input frame and then obtain its 2D rendering based on the user-specified ego-car trajectory. To enable dynamic modeling, we propose a dynamic editing module during training to enhance the renderings by editing the positions of the vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing models in both action accuracy and 3D spatial awareness, leading to more realistic, adaptable, and reliable scene modeling for safer autonomous driving. Additionally, our model can generalize to novel trajectories and offers interactive scene editing capabilities, such as object editing and object trajectory control.

Diffusion via Autoregressive models (D-AR) recasts the image diffusion process as a standard autoregressive task, achieving high-quality image generation with consistent previews and layout control using a large language model backbone.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents Diffusion via Autoregressive models (D-AR), a new paradigm recasting the image diffusion process as a vanilla autoregressive procedure in the standard next-token-prediction fashion. We start by designing the tokenizer that converts images into sequences of discrete tokens, where tokens in different positions can be decoded into different diffusion denoising steps in the pixel space. Thanks to the diffusion properties, these tokens naturally follow a coarse-to-fine order, which directly lends itself to autoregressive modeling. Therefore, we apply standard next-token prediction on these tokens, without modifying any underlying designs (either causal masks or training/inference strategies), and such sequential autoregressive token generation directly mirrors the diffusion procedure in image space. That is, once the autoregressive model generates an increment of tokens, we can directly decode these tokens into the corresponding diffusion denoising step in the streaming manner. Our pipeline naturally reveals several intriguing properties, for example, it supports consistent previews when generating only a subset of tokens and enables zero-shot layout-controlled synthesis. On the standard ImageNet benchmark, our method achieves 2.09 FID using a 775M Llama backbone with 256 discrete tokens. We hope our work can inspire future research on unified autoregressive architectures of visual synthesis, especially with large language models.

PatientSim generates diverse and realistic patient personas using clinical data to evaluate LLMs in medical dialogue settings.  					AI-generated summary 				 Doctor-patient consultations require multi-turn, context-aware communication tailored to diverse patient personas. Training or evaluating doctor LLMs in such settings requires realistic patient interaction systems. However, existing simulators often fail to reflect the full range of personas seen in clinical practice. To address this, we introduce PatientSim, a patient simulator that generates realistic and diverse patient personas for clinical scenarios, grounded in medical expertise. PatientSim operates using: 1) clinical profiles, including symptoms and medical history, derived from real-world data in the MIMIC-ED and MIMIC-IV datasets, and 2) personas defined by four axes: personality, language proficiency, medical history recall level, and cognitive confusion level, resulting in 37 unique combinations. We evaluated eight LLMs for factual accuracy and persona consistency. The top-performing open-source model, Llama 3.3, was validated by four clinicians to confirm the robustness of our framework. As an open-source, customizable platform, PatientSim provides a reproducible and scalable solution that can be customized for specific training needs. Offering a privacy-compliant environment, it serves as a robust testbed for evaluating medical dialogue systems across diverse patient presentations and shows promise as an educational tool for healthcare.

DeepTheorem enhances LLM theorem-proving through a large-scale natural language dataset and a tailored reinforcement learning strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results in informal theorem proving.  					AI-generated summary 				 Theorem proving serves as a major testbed for evaluating complex reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs). However, traditional automated theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that poorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving, leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning quality.

"DeepTheorem enhances LLM theorem-proving through a large-scale natural language dataset and a tailored reinforcement learning strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results in informal theorem proving.  					AI-generated summary 				 Theorem proving serves as a major testbed for evaluating complex reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs). However, traditional automated theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that poorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving, leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to fundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical exploration."

ZeroSep, a text-guided audio diffusion model, achieves zero-shot source separation through pre-trained models and text conditioning, outperforming supervised methods on various benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Audio source separation is fundamental for machines to understand complex acoustic environments and underpins numerous audio applications. Current supervised deep learning approaches, while powerful, are limited by the need for extensive, task-specific labeled data and struggle to generalize to the immense variability and open-set nature of real-world acoustic scenes. Inspired by the success of generative foundation models, we investigate whether pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion models can overcome these limitations. We make a surprising discovery: zero-shot source separation can be achieved purely through a pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion model under the right configuration. Our method, named ZeroSep, works by inverting the mixed audio into the diffusion model's latent space and then using text conditioning to guide the denoising process to recover individual sources. Without any task-specific training or fine-tuning, ZeroSep repurposes the generative diffusion model for a discriminative separation task and inherently supports open-set scenarios through its rich textual priors. ZeroSep is compatible with a variety of pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion backbones and delivers strong separation performance on multiple separation benchmarks, surpassing even supervised methods.

Entropy minimization with one sample and minimal optimization achieves significant performance improvements for large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 We trained 13,440 large language models and found that entropy minimization requires only a single unlabeled data and 10 steps optimization to achieve performance improvements comparable to or even greater than those obtained using thousands of data and carefully designed rewards in rule-based reinforcement learning.

ChartLens enhances multimodal language models with fine-grained visual attributions, improving the accuracy of chart understanding by 26-66%.  					AI-generated summary 				 The growing capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced tasks like chart understanding. However, these models often suffer from hallucinations, where generated text sequences conflict with the provided visual data. To address this, we introduce Post-Hoc Visual Attribution for Charts, which identifies fine-grained chart elements that validate a given chart-associated response. We propose ChartLens, a novel chart attribution algorithm that uses segmentation-based techniques to identify chart objects and employs set-of-marks prompting with MLLMs for fine-grained visual attribution. Additionally, we present ChartVA-Eval, a benchmark with synthetic and real-world charts from diverse domains like finance, policy, and economics, featuring fine-grained attribution annotations. Our evaluations show that ChartLens improves fine-grained attributions by 26-66%.

We propose ChartLens, a novel chart attribution algorithm that uses segmentation-based techniques to identify chart objects and employs set-of-marks prompting with MLLMs for fine-grained visual attribution. Additionally, we present ChartVA-Eval, a benchmark with synthetic and real-world charts from diverse domains like finance, policy, and economics, featuring fine-grained attribution annotations. Our evaluations show that ChartLens improves fine-grained attributions by 26-66%."

The study explores the structural patterns of knowledge in large language models from a graph perspective, uncovering knowledge homophily and developing models for graph machine learning to estimate entity knowledge.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models have been extensively studied as neural knowledge bases for their knowledge access, editability, reasoning, and explainability. However, few works focus on the structural patterns of their knowledge. Motivated by this gap, we investigate these structural patterns from a graph perspective. We quantify the knowledge of LLMs at both the triplet and entity levels, and analyze how it relates to graph structural properties such as node degree. Furthermore, we uncover the knowledge homophily, where topologically close entities exhibit similar levels of knowledgeability, which further motivates us to develop graph machine learning models to estimate entity knowledge based on its local neighbors. This model further enables valuable knowledge checking by selecting triplets less known to LLMs. Empirical results show that using selected triplets for fine-tuning leads to superior performance.

LoRAShop, a framework for multi-concept image editing with LoRA models, leverages spatially coherent feature activation in Flux-style diffusion transformers to achieve seamless integration of multiple subjects or styles while preserving global context and identity.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce LoRAShop, the first framework for multi-concept image editing with LoRA models. LoRAShop builds on a key observation about the feature interaction patterns inside Flux-style diffusion transformers: concept-specific transformer features activate spatially coherent regions early in the denoising process. We harness this observation to derive a disentangled latent mask for each concept in a prior forward pass and blend the corresponding LoRA weights only within regions bounding the concepts to be personalized. The resulting edits seamlessly integrate multiple subjects or styles into the original scene while preserving global context, lighting, and fine details. Our experiments demonstrate that LoRAShop delivers better identity preservation compared to baselines. By eliminating retraining and external constraints, LoRAShop turns personalized diffusion models into a practical `photoshop-with-LoRAs' tool and opens new avenues for compositional visual storytelling and rapid creative iteration.

Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance (A-CFG) dynamically adjusts the guidance in masked diffusion language models by focusing on areas of low model confidence, leading to significant improvements in language generation performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances controllability in generative models by interpolating conditional and unconditional predictions. However, standard CFG often employs a static unconditional input, which can be suboptimal for iterative generation processes where model uncertainty varies dynamically. We introduce Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance (A-CFG), a novel method that tailors the unconditional input by leveraging the model's instantaneous predictive confidence. At each step of an iterative (masked) diffusion language model, A-CFG identifies tokens in the currently generated sequence for which the model exhibits low confidence. These tokens are temporarily re-masked to create a dynamic, localized unconditional input. This focuses CFG's corrective influence precisely on areas of ambiguity, leading to more effective guidance. We integrate A-CFG into a state-of-the-art masked diffusion language model and demonstrate its efficacy. Experiments on diverse language generation benchmarks show that A-CFG yields substantial improvements over standard CFG, achieving, for instance, a 3.9 point gain on GPQA. Our work highlights the benefit of dynamically adapting guidance mechanisms to model uncertainty in iterative generation.
