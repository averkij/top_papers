Our experimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context understanding tasks show that Atlas surpasses the performance of Transformers and recent linear recurrent models. Atlas further improves the long context performance of Titans, achieving +80% accuracy in 10M context length of BABILong benchmark.The attention module (Bahdanau et al. 2014) is critical building block in modern deep learning architectures (Achiam et al. 2023; Behrouz, Zhong, et al. 2024; Kamath et al. 2025; Vaswani et al. 2017), excelling due to its scalability and performance in in-context retrieval tasks. In principle, attention functions as an associative memory, computing direct pairwise token dependencies to store key-value mappings and retrieve them via query-key similarities. Computing this pairwise dependencies, however, while accurate, causes quadratic space and time complexity, limiting their applicability in long context understanding, memorization, or modeling (Dalal et al. 2025; Li, Huang, et al. 2024; Liu, Lin, et al. 2024). Recent research efforts aim to overcome the limitations of Transformersi.e., pure attention-based architecturesin long-context modeling by designing more efficient yet effective recurrent neural networks (Behrouz, Zhong, et al. 2024; Peng, Zhang, et al. 2025; Schlag et al. 2021). These modern recurrent architectures can be unified as associative memory modules optimizing an internal objective termed attentional bias (Behrouz, Razaviyayn, et al. 2025). Unlike Transformers growing KV cache, these models use fixed-size memory, necessitating improved memory management. Consequently, theres growing interest in enhancing RNN memory management through more effective: (i) Learning rules, from additive learning (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) to DeltaNets Delta rule (Schlag et al. 2021); (ii) Forget (Retention) Gates, from RetNets input-independent gating (Sun, Dong, et al. 2023) to adaptive gating in Titans (Behrouz, Zhong, et al. 2024) and RWKV7 (Peng, Zhang, et al. 2025); and (iii) Memory Architectures, from vector-valued memory (Peng, Alcaide, et al. 2023; Sun, Dong, et al. 2023) to neural deep memory modules (Behrouz, Zhong, et al. 2024; Sun, Li, et al. 2024). Despite the success of these improved models in diverse set of downstream benchmarks, they often struggle with long context understanding, in-context retrieval, and extrapolation to longer sequences (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024; {alibehrouz, zemanli, pkacham, dengyuan, peilinz, razaviyayn, mirrokni}@google.com, and majiddl.2099@gmail.com 1 Table 1: summary of the recent modern recurrent neural networks. We compare these architectures based on five characteristics: (1) Dynamic decay; (2) Deep neural memory; (3) non-linear memory capacity; (4) Locally optimal: managing memory by (approximating) the second-order information about tokens; (5) Flexible context: the ability to flexibly memorize the context. 𝜙 () and 𝜙 () represent polynomial and infinite-dimensional feature mappings (see Equation 22).

Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, paving the way for scalable, controllable, and highfidelity multi-subject video synthesis. Code and model can be found at: https://github.com/MAGREF-Video/MAGREF.growing interest in multi-subject driven video generation, which aims to integrate diverse visual cues into coherent and personalized video sequence. However, the use of multimodal conditions, combining both images and text, along with an increasing number of reference images, significantly expands the conditioning space in multi-subject driven video generation. This often results in complex interactions between multiple identities, objects, and backgrounds which significantly complicates the model training. Consequently, it becomes extremely challenging to consistently preserve each subjects identity across varying poses and frames, to accurately capture inter subject and subjectscene relationships, and to faithfully adhere to user specified scene layout, semantics, and motion dynamics. This gives rise to two key challenges: (1) Generation stability under any reference composition. The model must remain stable when conditioned on various combinations of reference images, avoiding common artifacts such as semantic mismatches between subjects and backgrounds, and visual inconsistencies caused by conflicting reference inputs. (2) Fine-grained identity consistency. The model must preserve each subjects coherent and detailed appearance throughout the video, including subtle features such as facial structure and accessories. Recent works have explored various strategies to address these challenges. [Wei et al. 2025; Yuan et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2025] have achieved promising results in single identity preserving video synthesis. However, these models depend on external identity modules and single image reference, leading to limited scalability and reduced flexibility in real world applications. Moreover, methods such as [Jiang et al. 2025; Liu et al. 2025; Zhong et al. 2025] simplify the conditioning process by directly concatenating visual tokens along the token dimension. These approaches are typically built upon T2V generation frameworks and require large scale datasets for effective training. As result, they often struggle with identity preservation, particularly for fine-grained facial features, and exhibit limited generalization to out of domain inputs. SkyReels-A2 [Fei et al. 2025] offers an alternative I2V based design, processing reference images along the channel dimension and applying temporal mask. However, its vanilla masking strategy directly copies mask frames across time, which compromises the modeling capacity of the I2V backbone. This results in instability during video generation, with inconsistent frame quality and identity drift persisting. In this paper, we aim to address two fundamental challenges in multi-subject driven video generation: reference-image consistency and visual stability. We observe that the consistency between the generated video and the input reference images largely depends on how the reference conditions are injected into the model. Accurate and fine-grained integration of multi-subject visual information is crucial for maintaining visual alignment with the references. Additionally, the stability of the generated frames is highly sensitive to the training paradigm. We suppose that carefully designed training scheme is essential to adapt multi-subject driven generation tasks to pre-trained video models while preserving temporal coherence. Based on these observations, we propose MAGREF (Masked Guidance for Any-Reference Video Generation), unified and flexible framework designed to handle varied combinations of reference Deng et al. images (e.g., human identities, objects, backgrounds) when used in conjunction with textual prompts. Specifically, we begin by constructing blank canvas and randomly positioning each provided subject reference image onto it. To guide the generation process, we introduce region-aware dynamic masking strategy that indicates the spatial locations of each subject on the given reference canvas. This strategy enables precise and consistent conditioning, effectively bridging reference-image information with temporal dynamics during video synthesis. To alleviate fine-grained information loss commonly encountered in token-wise concatenation mechanism, MAGREF leverages pixelwise reference encoding on the channel dimension, significantly enhancing appearance fidelity. This mechanism introduces minimal architectural modifications, ensuring maximal preservation of pre-trained model capabilities and offering robust solution for multisubject video synthesis. Overall, the key contributions of MAGREF are as follows: We introduce regio"

A new benchmark, VF-Eval, evaluates the capabilities of MLLMs in interpreting AI-generated content videos across four tasks, highlighting challenges and demonstrating benefits in video generation through human feedback alignment.  					AI-generated summary 				 MLLMs have been widely studied for video question answering recently. However, most existing assessments focus on natural videos, overlooking synthetic videos, such as AI-generated content (AIGC). Meanwhile, some works in video generation rely on MLLMs to evaluate the quality of generated videos, but the capabilities of MLLMs on interpreting AIGC videos remain largely underexplored. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VF-Eval, which introduces four tasks-coherence validation, error awareness, error type detection, and reasoning evaluation-to comprehensively evaluate the abilities of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VF-Eval and find that even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our benchmark. Additionally, to investigate the practical applications of VF-Eval in improving video generation, we conduct an experiment, RePrompt, demonstrating that aligning MLLMs more closely with human feedback can benefit video generation.

LLMs exhibit robustness to reward noise during post-training and achieve high performance using reasoning pattern rewards (RPR) in conjunction with noisy reward models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent studies on post-training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL) typically focus on tasks that can be accurately verified and rewarded, such as solving math problems. In contrast, our research investigates the impact of reward noise, a more practical consideration for real-world scenarios involving the post-training of LLMs using reward models. We found that LLMs demonstrate strong robustness to substantial reward noise. For example, manually flipping 40% of the reward function's outputs in math tasks still allows a Qwen-2.5-7B model to achieve rapid convergence, improving its performance on math tasks from 5% to 72%, compared to the 75% accuracy achieved by a model trained with noiseless rewards. Surprisingly, by only rewarding the appearance of key reasoning phrases (namely reasoning pattern reward, RPR), such as ``first, I need to''-without verifying the correctness of answers, the model achieved peak downstream performance (over 70% accuracy for Qwen-2.5-7B) comparable to models trained with strict correctness verification and accurate rewards. Recognizing the importance of the reasoning process over the final results, we combined RPR with noisy reward models. RPR helped calibrate the noisy reward models, mitigating potential false negatives and enhancing the LLM's performance on open-ended tasks. These findings suggest the importance of improving models' foundational abilities during the pre-training phase while providing insights for advancing post-training techniques.

EvoScale, an evolutionary and reinforcement learning-based method, enhances small language models' performance on real-world software engineering tasks by iteratively improving and refining outputs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Language models (LMs) perform well on standardized coding benchmarks but struggle with real-world software engineering tasks such as resolving GitHub issues in SWE-Bench, especially when model parameters are less than 100B. While smaller models are preferable in practice due to their lower computational cost, improving their performance remains challenging. Existing approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data, which is expensive to curate at scale. An alternative is test-time scaling: generating multiple outputs, scoring them using a verifier, and selecting the best one. Although effective, this strategy often requires excessive sampling and costly scoring, limiting its practical application. We propose Evolutionary Test-Time Scaling (EvoScale), a sample-efficient method that treats generation as an evolutionary process. By iteratively refining outputs via selection and mutation, EvoScale shifts the output distribution toward higher-scoring regions, reducing the number of samples needed to find correct solutions. To reduce the overhead from repeatedly sampling and selection, we train the model to self-evolve using reinforcement learning (RL). Rather than relying on external verifiers at inference time, the model learns to self-improve the scores of its own generations across iterations. Evaluated on SWE-Bench-Verified, EvoScale enables our 32B model, Satori-SWE-32B, to match or exceed the performance of models with over 100B parameters while using a few samples. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.

ZeroGUI is an online learning framework that uses Vision-Language Models for task generation and reward estimation, enhancing GUI Agents' performance with minimal human intervention.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid advancement of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has propelled the development of pure-vision-based GUI Agents, capable of perceiving and operating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) to autonomously fulfill user instructions. However, existing approaches usually adopt an offline learning framework, which faces two core limitations: (1) heavy reliance on high-quality manual annotations for element grounding and action supervision, and (2) limited adaptability to dynamic and interactive environments. To address these limitations, we propose ZeroGUI, a scalable, online learning framework for automating GUI Agent training at Zero human cost. Specifically, ZeroGUI integrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training goals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward estimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions, and (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with and learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents (UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance across OSWorld and AndroidLab environments.

"ZeroGUI is an online learning framework that uses Vision-Language Models for task generation and reward estimation, enhancing GUI Agents' performance with minimal human intervention.  					AI-generated summary 				 The rapid advancement of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has propelled the development of pure-vision-based GUI Agents, capable of perceiving and operating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) to autonomously fulfill user instructions. However, existing approaches usually adopt an offline learning framework, which faces two core limitations: (1) heavy reliance on high-quality manual annotations for element grounding and action supervision, and (2) limited adaptability to dynamic and interactive environments. To address these limitations, we propose ZeroGUI, a scalable, online learning framework for automating GUI Agent training at Zero human cost. Specifically, ZeroGUI integrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training goals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward estimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions, and (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with and learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents (UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance across OSWorld and AndroidLab environments. The code is available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ZeroGUI."

SafeScientist is an AI framework that enhances safety in AI-driven scientific research through multiple defensive mechanisms and is validated using the SciSafetyBench benchmark.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in large language model (LLM) agents have significantly accelerated scientific discovery automation, yet concurrently raised critical ethical and safety concerns. To systematically address these challenges, we introduce SafeScientist, an innovative AI scientist framework explicitly designed to enhance safety and ethical responsibility in AI-driven scientific exploration. SafeScientist proactively refuses ethically inappropriate or high-risk tasks and rigorously emphasizes safety throughout the research process. To achieve comprehensive safety oversight, we integrate multiple defensive mechanisms, including prompt monitoring, agent-collaboration monitoring, tool-use monitoring, and an ethical reviewer component. Complementing SafeScientist, we propose SciSafetyBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate AI safety in scientific contexts, comprising 240 high-risk scientific tasks across 6 domains, alongside 30 specially designed scientific tools and 120 tool-related risk tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SafeScientist significantly improves safety performance by 35\% compared to traditional AI scientist frameworks, without compromising scientific output quality. Additionally, we rigorously validate the robustness of our safety pipeline against diverse adversarial attack methods, further confirming the effectiveness of our integrated approach.

ToMAP enhances LLM persuaders with Theory of Mind modules, improving opponent awareness and argument quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion, but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably, while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader (ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably, ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training, which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more persuasive language agents. Code is available at: https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/ToMAP.

Transformers have been established as the most popular backbones in sequence modeling, mainly due to their effectiveness in in-context retrieval tasks and the ability to learn at scale. Their quadratic memory and time complexity, however, bound their applicability in longer sequences and so has motivated researchers to explore effective alternative architectures such as modern recurrent neural networks (a.k.a long-term recurrent memory module). Despite their recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that requires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We observe that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their design: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of memory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e., optimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less expressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three aspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that learns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current and past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models. Building on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like architectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the original Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context understanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers and recent linear recurrent models. ATLAS further improves the long context performance of Titans, achieving +80\% accuracy in 10M context length of BABILong benchmark.

"Transformers have been established as the most popular backbones in sequence modeling, mainly due to their effectiveness in in-context retrieval tasks and the ability to learn at scale. Their quadratic memory and time complexity, however, bound their applicability in longer sequences and so has motivated researchers to explore effective alternative architectures such as modern recurrent neural networks (a.k.a long-term recurrent memory module). Despite their recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that requires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We observe that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their design: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of memory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e., optimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less expressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three aspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that learns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current and past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models. Building on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like architectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the original Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context understanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers and recent linear recurrent models. ATLAS further improves the long context performance of Titans, achieving +80\% accuracy in 10M context length of BABILong benchmark."

Reinforcement learning algorithms are fundamental to align large language models with human preferences and to enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, current reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from training instability due to loose on-policy constraints and computational inefficiency due to auxiliary models. In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal reward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm designed to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact on-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and enhances exploration. Moreover, OPO introduces the optimal reward baseline that theoretically minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and training stability without additional models or regularization terms. Furthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy, encouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight OPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in large language model alignment and reasoning tasks. The implementation is provided at https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/opo.

Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

TrustVLM enhances the reliability of Vision-Language Models by estimating prediction trustworthiness without retraining, improving misclassification detection in multimodal tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in aligning visual and textual modalities, enabling a wide range of applications in multimodal understanding and generation. While they excel in zero-shot and transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification, often yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We rigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4 architectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95 compared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model without requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of VLMs in real-world applications. The code will be available at https://github.com/EPFL-IMOS/TrustVLM.

"TrustVLM enhances the reliability of Vision-Language Models by estimating prediction trustworthiness without retraining, improving misclassification detection in multimodal tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in aligning visual and textual modalities, enabling a wide range of applications in multimodal understanding and generation. While they excel in zero-shot and transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification, often yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We rigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4 architectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95 compared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model without requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of VLMs in real-world applications. The code will be available at https://github.com/EPFL-IMOS/TrustVLM."

Video generation has made substantial strides with the emergence of deep generative models, especially diffusion-based approaches. However, video generation based on multiple reference subjects still faces significant challenges in maintaining multi-subject consistency and ensuring high generation quality. In this paper, we propose MAGREF, a unified framework for any-reference video generation that introduces masked guidance to enable coherent multi-subject video synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images and a textual prompt. Specifically, we propose (1) a region-aware dynamic masking mechanism that enables a single model to flexibly handle various subject inference, including humans, objects, and backgrounds, without architectural changes, and (2) a pixel-wise channel concatenation mechanism that operates on the channel dimension to better preserve appearance features. Our model delivers state-of-the-art video generation quality, generalizing from single-subject training to complex multi-subject scenarios with coherent synthesis and precise control over individual subjects, outperforming existing open-source and commercial baselines. To facilitate evaluation, we also introduce a comprehensive multi-subject video benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, paving the way for scalable, controllable, and high-fidelity multi-subject video synthesis.

The issue-resolving task, where a model generates patches to fix real-world bugs, has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While SWE-bench and its variants have become standard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been updated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and depend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment setup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and data contamination. In this work, we present SWE-bench-Live, a live-updatable benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our initial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created since 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated Docker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is \method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process from instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and enabling scalability and continuous updates. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agent frameworks and LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a substantial performance gap compared to static benchmarks like SWE-bench, even under controlled evaluation conditions. To better understand this discrepancy, we perform detailed analyses across repository origin, issue recency, and task difficulty. By providing a fresh, diverse, and executable benchmark grounded in live repository activity, SWE-bench-Live facilitates rigorous, contamination-resistant evaluation of LLMs and agents in dynamic, real-world software development settings.

A benchmark using deceptive text samples to evaluate compositional vulnerabilities in multimodal representations is introduced, and a self-training approach improves zero-shot methods by enhancing attack success and sample diversity.  					AI-generated summary 				 While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and audios.

CheXStruct and CXReasonBench evaluate Large Vision-Language Models in clinical diagnosis by assessing structured reasoning, visual grounding, and generalization using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent progress in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enabled promising applications in medical tasks, such as report generation and visual question answering. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on the final diagnostic answer, offering limited insight into whether models engage in clinically meaningful reasoning. To address this, we present CheXStruct and CXReasonBench, a structured pipeline and benchmark built on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. CheXStruct automatically derives a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps directly from chest X-rays, such as segmenting anatomical regions, deriving anatomical landmarks and diagnostic measurements, computing diagnostic indices, and applying clinical thresholds. CXReasonBench leverages this pipeline to evaluate whether models can perform clinically valid reasoning steps and to what extent they can learn from structured guidance, enabling fine-grained and transparent assessment of diagnostic reasoning. The benchmark comprises 18,988 QA pairs across 12 diagnostic tasks and 1,200 cases, each paired with up to 4 visual inputs, and supports multi-path, multi-stage evaluation including visual grounding via anatomical region selection and diagnostic measurements. Even the strongest of 10 evaluated LVLMs struggle with structured reasoning and generalization, often failing to link abstract knowledge with anatomically grounded visual interpretation.
