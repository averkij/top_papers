Text:"5 2 0 2 8 2 ] . [ 1 5 6 7 2 2 . 5 0 5 2 : r StressTest: Can YOUR Speech LM Handle the Stress? Iddo Yosha Gallil Maimon Yossi Adiiddo.yosha@mail.huji.ac.ilSentence stress refers to emphasis, placed on specific words within spoken utterance to highlight or contrast an idea, or to introduce new information. It is often used to imply an underlying intention that is not explicitly stated. Recent advances in speech-aware language models (SLMs) have enabled direct processing of audio, allowing models to bypass transcription and access the full richness of the speech signal and perform audio reasoning tasks such as spoken question answering. Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in shaping meaning and speaker intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation and development of such models. In this work, we address this gap by introducing StressTest, benchmark specifically designed to evaluate models ability to distinguish between interpretations of spoken sentences based on the stress pattern. We assess the performance of several leading SLMs and find that, despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose novel synthetic data generation pipeline, and create Stress-17k, training set that simulates change of meaning implied by stress variation. Then, we empirically show that optimizing models with this synthetic dataset aligns well with real-world recordings and enables effective finetuning of SLMs. Results suggest, that our finetuned model, StresSLM, significantly outperforms existing models on both sentence stress reasoning and detection tasks. Code, models, data, and audio samples - https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/stresstest.Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized language processing, enabling new forms of human-computer interaction [Minaee et al., 2025; Grattafiori et al., 2024]. As the field advanced, researchers have started exploring the integration of other modalities into LLMs, aiming to enrich their understanding of the world [Carolan et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023]. In particular, the incorporation of speech and audio into LLMs has gained notable traction, equipping models with the ability to listen, speak, and reason about audio [Arora et al., 2025; Ghosh et al., 2025; Maimon et al., 2025a]. An elementary approach of integrating speech into LLMs follows cascade paradigm [Ji et al., 2024], where audio is first transcribed by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, and the resulting text is then processed by language model. While effective to some extent, this approach falls short of capturing the full expressive range of spoken language. Speech carries rich paralinguistic cues such as emotion, speaker identity, and prosodic characteristics including pitch (f0), loudness, duration, timbre and rhythm, that are often lost in transcription [Wilson and Wharton, 2006; Van Heuven, 2018]. One key aspect of prosody is sentence stress, which refers to the emphasis placed on particular words or phrases within sentence to highlight an idea or to contrast another [Bolinger, 1972]. For example, Preprint. Under review. Figure 1: StressTest provides samples that can be understood differently based on different stress patterns. We consider both sentence stress detection (SSD) and sentence stress reasoning (SSR). StresSLM detects the stress and reasons about the intended meaning. consider the sentence didnt say she stole the money. Depending on which word is stressed, the sentence can express dramatically different meanings, despite its written-form remaining unchanged. Recent developments in Speech-aware LMs (SLMs) aim to address these limitations by enabling models to process audio directly, bypassing the need for explicit transcription and allowing them to access the full range of acoustic information [Arora et al., 2025]. State-of-the-art models in this space have demonstrated impressive performance across wide range of tasks, including audio question answering, automatic speech recognition, and emotion recognition [Chu et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024]. Nevertheless, sentence stress has received limited attention in the evaluation and development of these models, despite its vital role in expressing the speakers intent and meaning. We argue that interpreting sentence stress requires the listener to reason about the intended meaning based on stress placement, which can often be inferred even without explicit context. In this work, we address this gap by introducing StressTest, comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate models ability to distinguish spoken sentence meanings based on different stress patterns. We then evaluate leading SLMs on our benchmark to quantify their capacity for stress based reasoning. Additionally, we introduce novel synthetic dataset generation pipeline, which produces the Stress-17k dataset. We empirically show that finetuning model using Stress-17k leads to enhanced ability to detect and model sentence stress on real-world recordings. Through extensive empirical evaluation and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our finetuned model, StresSLM, significantly outperforms existing models in both stress detection and sentence stress reasoning, with minimal performance degradation on its original tasks. Our contributions: (i) We propose StressTest, novel benchmark for evaluating sentence stress understanding in SLMs; (ii) We analyze the performance of several leading models on this benchmark, and show that they fail to detect sentence stress and to reason about the underlying meaning, based on the stress pattern; (iii) Lastly, we propose synthetic data generation pipeline and demonstrate its effectiveness by finetuning leading SLM.Theoretical views of sentence stress. As described by Ladd [2008], theoretical accounts of sentence stress, can be broadly divided into two main perspectives. The first is the phonological view, which defines the notion of normal stress as the default prosodic pattern in an utterance. This view is formalized in the Nuclear Stress Rule [Chomsky and Halle, 1968], which assumes that sentence stress is determined by syntactic structure and does not necessarily convey special semantic intent. The second, views stress as semantic phenomenon that conveys the speakers intention. According to this perspective, stress can be flexibly assigned to any word in sentence to highlight its relative importance in the discourse. Such stress can signal new information,"

Advanced ODE-based solvers have recently been developed to mitigate the substantial computational demands of reverse-diffusion solving under limited sampling steps. However, these solvers, heavily inspired by Adams-like multistep methods, rely solely on t-related Lagrange interpolation. We show that t-related Lagrange interpolation is suboptimal for diffusion models and reveal compact search space comprised of time steps and solver coefficients. Building on our analysis, we propose novel differentiable solver search algorithm to identify more optimal solver. Equipped with the searched solver, rectified-flow models, e.g., SiT-XL/2 and FlowDCN-XL/2, achieve FID scores of 2.40 and 2.35, respectively, on ImageNet-256 256 with only 10 steps. Meanwhile, DDPM model, DiT-XL/2, reaches FID 1State Key Lab of Novel Software Technology, Nanjing Uni2Taobao & Tmall Group of Alibaba, versity, Nanjing, China.

PMLR 267, 2025. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 score of 2.33 with only 10 steps. Notably, our searched solver significantly outperforms traditional solvers(even some distillation methods). Moreover, our searched solver demonstrates generality across various model architectures, resolutions, and model sizes. 1. Introduction Image generation is fundamental task in computer vision research, which aims at capturing the inherent data distribution of original image datasets and generating high-quality synthetic images through distribution sampling. Diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020b; Karras et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Lipman et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2025) have recently emerged as highly promising solutions to learn the underlying data distribution in image generation, outperforming GAN-based models (Brock et al., 2018; Sauer et al., 2022) and Auto-Regressive models (Chang et al., 2022) by significant margin. However, diffusion models necessitate numerous denoising steps during inference, which incur substantial computational cost, thereby limiting the widespread deployment of pre-trained diffusion models. To achieve fast diffusion sampling, the existing studies have explored two distinct approaches. Training-based techniques by distilling the fast ODE trajectory into the model parameters, thereby circumIn addition, solverventing redundant refinement steps. Differentiable Solver Search for Fast Diffusion Sampling based methods (Lu et al., 2023; Zhang & Chen, 2023; Song et al., 2020a) tackle the fast sampling problem by designing high-order numerical ODE solvers. For training-based acceleration, (Salimans & Ho, 2022) aligns the single-step student denoiser with the multi-step teacher output, thereby reducing inference burdens. The consistency model concept, introduced by (Song et al., 2023), directly teaches the model to produce consistent predictions at any arbitrary timesteps. Building upon (Song et al., 2023), subsequent works (Zheng et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a; Song et al., 2025) propose improved techniques to mitigate discreet errors in LCM training. Furthermore, (Lin et al., 2024; Kang et al., 2024; Yin et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023) leverage adversarial training and distribution matching to enhance the quality of generated samples. To improve the training efficiency of distribution matching. However, training-based methods introduce changes to the model parameters, resulting in an inability to fully exploit the pre-training performance. Solver-based methods rely heavily on the ODE formulation in the reverse-diffusion dynamics and hand-crafted multi-step solvers. (Lu et al., 2023; 2022) and (Zhang & Chen, 2023) point out the semi-linear structure of the diffusion ODE and propose an exponential integrator to tackle faster sampling in diffusion models. (Zhao et al., 2023) further enhances the sampling quality by borrowing the predictor-corrector structure. Thanks to the multistep-based ODE solver methods, high-quality samples can be generated within as few as 10 steps. To further improve efficiency, (Gao et al., 2023) tracks the backward error and determines the adaptive step. Moreover, (Karras et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022) propose handcrafted timesteps scheduler to sample respaced timesteps. (Xue et al., 2024) argues that timesteps sampled in (Karras et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022) are suboptimal, thus proposing an online optimization algorithm to find the optimal sampling timesteps for generation. Apart from timesteps optimization, (Shaul et al., 2023) learns specific path transition to improve the sampling efficiency. In contrast to training-based acceleration methods, solverbased approaches do not necessitate parameter adjustments and preserve the optimal performance of the pre-trained model. Moreover, solvers can be seamlessly applied to any arbitrary diffusion model trained with similar noise scheduler, offering high degree of flexibility and adaptability. This motivates us to investigate the generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models within limited steps from diffusion solver perspective. Current state-of-the-art diffusion solvers (Lu et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023) adopt Adams-like multi-step methods that use the Lagrange interpolation function to minimize integral errors. We argue that an optimal solver should be tailored to specific pre-trained denoising functions and their corresponding noise schedulers. In this paper, we explore solver-based methods for fast diffusion sampling by improving diffusion solvers using data-driven approaches without destroying the pre-training internality in diffusion models. Inspired by (Xue et al., 2024), we investigate the sources of error in the diffusion ODE and discover that the interpolation function"

A multi-modal CAD reconstruction model leveraging vision-language models and reinforcement learning achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, including real-world ones.  					AI-generated summary 				 Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a central role in engineering and manufacturing, making it possible to create precise and editable 3D models. Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds, images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities. Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three challenging datasets, including a real-world one.

A StressTest benchmark and synthetic Stress17k dataset are introduced to improve speech-aware language models' ability to interpret sentence stress in spoken language.  					AI-generated summary 				 Sentence stress refers to emphasis, placed on specific words within a spoken utterance to highlight or contrast an idea, or to introduce new information. It is often used to imply an underlying intention that is not explicitly stated. Recent advances in speech-aware language models (SLMs) have enabled direct processing of audio, allowing models to bypass transcription and access the full richness of the speech signal and perform audio reasoning tasks such as spoken question answering. Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in shaping meaning and speaker intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation and development of such models. In this work, we address this gap by introducing StressTest, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate a model's ability to distinguish between interpretations of spoken sentences based on the stress pattern. We assess the performance of several leading SLMs and find that, despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel synthetic data generation pipeline, and create Stress17k, a training set that simulates change of meaning implied by stress variation. Then, we empirically show that optimizing models with this synthetic dataset aligns well with real-world recordings and enables effective finetuning of SLMs. Results suggest, that our finetuned model, StresSLM, significantly outperforms existing models on both sentence stress reasoning and detection tasks.

Researchers propose a novel differentiable solver search algorithm that optimizes the computational efficiency and quality of diffusion models for image generation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation quality but at the cost of numerous function evaluations. Recently, advanced ODE-based solvers have been developed to mitigate the substantial computational demands of reverse-diffusion solving under limited sampling steps. However, these solvers, heavily inspired by Adams-like multistep methods, rely solely on t-related Lagrange interpolation. We show that t-related Lagrange interpolation is suboptimal for diffusion model and reveal a compact search space comprised of time steps and solver coefficients. Building on our analysis, we propose a novel differentiable solver search algorithm to identify more optimal solver. Equipped with the searched solver, rectified-flow models, e.g., SiT-XL/2 and FlowDCN-XL/2, achieve FID scores of 2.40 and 2.35, respectively, on ImageNet256 with only 10 steps. Meanwhile, DDPM model, DiT-XL/2, reaches a FID score of 2.33 with only 10 steps. Notably, our searched solver outperforms traditional solvers by a significant margin. Moreover, our searched solver demonstrates generality across various model architectures, resolutions, and model sizes.

Theoretical analysis of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) reveals that log-ratio reward parameterization is optimal for learning target policy via preference optimization, linked to log-margin ordered policies, and explains policy reinforcement and smoothing based on differential information entropy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for aligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio reward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap by utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution over token sequences that captures the information gained during policy updates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential information required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the log-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the target policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a closed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected responses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode differential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption regarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in preference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the entropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential information reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential information induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood displacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic experiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our results suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial for general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential information benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work presents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of preference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of differential information.

First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential information required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the log-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the target policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a closed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected responses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode differential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption regarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in preference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the entropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential information reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential information induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood displacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic experiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our results suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial for general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential information benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work presents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of preference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of differential information."
