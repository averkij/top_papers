Text:"5 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 1 8 7 6 3 2 . 5 0 5 2 : r aGabriel Sarch Snigdha Saha Naitik Khandelwal Ayush Jain Michael J. Tarr Aviral Kumar Katerina Fragkiadakivisually-grounded-rl.github.io Figure 1: Grounded visual reasoning enables interpretable and accurate answers. ViGoRL decomposes the task into sequence of natural language thoughts anchored in image regions. In contrast, Vanilla GRPO and SFT baselines produce ungrounded and incorrect responses.While reinforcement learning (RL) over chains of thought has significantly advanced language models in tasks such as mathematics and coding, visual reasoning introduces added complexity by requiring models to direct visual attention, interpret perceptual inputs, and ground abstract reasoning in spatial evidence. We introduce ViGoRL (Visually Grounded Reinforcement Learning), vision-language model trained with RL to explicitly anchor each reasoning step to specific visual coordinates. Inspired by human visual decision-making, ViGoRL learns to produce spatially grounded reasoning traces, guiding visual attention to task-relevant regions at each step. When fine-grained exploration is required, our novel multi-turn RL framework enables the model to dynamically zoom into predicted coordinates as reasoning unfolds. Across diverse set of visual reasoning benchmarksincluding SAT-2 and BLINK for spatial reasoning, Vbench for visual search, and ScreenSpot and VisualWebArena for web-based groundingViGoRL consistently outperforms both supervised fine-tuning and conventional RL baselines that lack explicit grounding mechanisms. Incorporating multi-turn RL with zoomed-in visual feedback significantly improves ViGoRLs performance on localizing small GUI elements and visual search, achieving 86.4% on VBench. Additionally, we find that grounding amplifies other visual behaviors such as region exploration, grounded subgoal setting, and visual verification. Finally, human evaluations show that the models visual references are not only spatially accurate but also helpful for understanding model reasoning steps. Our results show that visually grounded RL is strong paradigm for imbuing models with general-purpose visual reasoning.Visual reasoning tasks vary widely in structure and often demand different solution strategies depending on the problem at hand. Some tasks are dominated by salient visual cues, such as recognizing refrigerator centered in kitchen scene, while others, like locating pair of scissors in cluttered environment, require sequential visual search and selective attention. Despite this diversity, most state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) operate in an end-to-end fashion, predicting answers directly in single forward pass. These models often lack the ability to adapt their computational strategies to different tasks or to expose intermediate reasoning beyond visual attention maps. Promptbased models, such as ViperGPT [54], VisualProg [19], and V* [67], explicitly decompose visual tasks into sequences of subgoals or intermediate steps to improve interpretability and performance without additional training. However, such models typically generate fixed reasoning chains that do not adapt to the structure of the input scene. Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) over reasoning chains have significantly enhanced the capabilities of LLMs in text-based domains [17, 58, 26], enabling them to learn diverse reasoning strategies tailored to the context. However, RL can only build upon skills or compose reasoning behaviors that are already latent in the base models sampling distribution [13, 82]. For e.g., Gandhi et al. [13] has identified key cognitive behaviors in text-based domains, such as setting sub-goals, backtracking, verification, that support self-improvement under RL. Models lacking these behaviors often do not benefit from RL and must be bootstrapped via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on curated reasoning traces before RL is run [13, 82]. However, it remains unclear whether the cognitive behaviors identified in text-based domains similarly support generalization in visual reasoning tasks. Several recent works have attempted RL fine-tuning directly on base vision-language models (VLMs) [38, 37, 87, 55, 57, 84, 51, 41, 32], implicitly assuming RL alone can induce useful cognitive behaviors. However, our analysis reveals that such naïve applications of RL typically yield abstract, ungrounded reasoning rather than richer, visually grounded cognitive behaviors (see Section 3.1, 5.3). These findings align with prior research showing that explicitly prompting VLMs to reference spatial object locations improves performance and interpretability [67, 73, 14], suggesting that grounding thought in spatial regions may serve as key cognitive behavior for effective visual reasoning. Thus, critical open question arises: How can we embed useful cognitive behaviors in VLMs before applying RL to achieve robust visual reasoning? We hypothesize that models both see better and think better when their textual reasoning steps are explicitly grounded in specific image regions, promoting more targeted and systematic crossreferencing between textual and visual information during reasoning. This hypothesis is inspired by the fact that humans systematically shift their restricted gaze to selectively gather and integrate task-relevant information when reasoning about the world [75, 22, 74]. Grounding may serve similar role in models, functioning as spatial attention mechanism that enables accurate feature binding [61] and supports deictic reference [4] to simplify multi-step reasoning through localized perceptual anchoring. We move beyond prompt-based reasoning, proposing that learning to compose reasoning steps explicitly anchored in image coordinates induces structured region-level behaviors that support improved generalization in visual tasks. Our Approach. We introduce multi-turn RL framework for training VLMs to reason in grounded, visually-aware manner. This stands in contrast to LLM reasoning in math or code, where grounding in external input is not strictly required. Within each reasoning step, the model produces natural language thought along with corresponding spatial grounding (i.e., an (x, y) location in the image). This enables it to progressively refine its attention and gather task-relevant visual information as reasoning unfolds. By incorporating multi-turn interaction into the RL processwhere each turn consists of one or more reasoning steps f"

Rebus puzzles, visual riddles that encode language through imagery, spatial arrangement, and symbolic substitution, pose a unique challenge to current vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional image captioning or question answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and understanding visual metaphors.

ViGoRL, a vision-language model enhanced with visually grounded reinforcement learning, achieves superior performance across various visual reasoning tasks by dynamically focusing visual attention and grounding reasoning in spatial evidence.  					AI-generated summary 				 While reinforcement learning (RL) over chains of thought has significantly advanced language models in tasks such as mathematics and coding, visual reasoning introduces added complexity by requiring models to direct visual attention, interpret perceptual inputs, and ground abstract reasoning in spatial evidence. We introduce ViGoRL (Visually Grounded Reinforcement Learning), a vision-language model trained with RL to explicitly anchor each reasoning step to specific visual coordinates. Inspired by human visual decision-making, ViGoRL learns to produce spatially grounded reasoning traces, guiding visual attention to task-relevant regions at each step. When fine-grained exploration is required, our novel multi-turn RL framework enables the model to dynamically zoom into predicted coordinates as reasoning unfolds. Across a diverse set of visual reasoning benchmarks--including SAT-2 and BLINK for spatial reasoning, V*bench for visual search, and ScreenSpot and VisualWebArena for web-based grounding--ViGoRL consistently outperforms both supervised fine-tuning and conventional RL baselines that lack explicit grounding mechanisms. Incorporating multi-turn RL with zoomed-in visual feedback significantly improves ViGoRL's performance on localizing small GUI elements and visual search, achieving 86.4% on V*Bench. Additionally, we find that grounding amplifies other visual behaviors such as region exploration, grounded subgoal setting, and visual verification. Finally, human evaluations show that the model's visual references are not only spatially accurate but also helpful for understanding model reasoning steps. Our results show that visually grounded RL is a strong paradigm for imbuing models with general-purpose visual reasoning.
