Text:"5 2 0 2 4 1 ] . [ 1 5 9 3 0 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r XQUANT: Breaking the Memory Wall for LLM Inference with KV Cache Rematerialization Aditya Tomar* 1 Coleman Hooper* 1 Minjae Lee2 Haocheng Xi1 Rishabh Tiwari1 Wonjun Kang2 Luca Manolache1 Michael W. Mahoney1,3,4 Kurt Keutzer1 Amir Gholami1,Although LLM inference has emerged as critical workload for many downstream applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few decades, trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present XQUANT, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X, instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2 memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQUANT, we achieve up to 7.7 memory savings with < 0.1 perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that values are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce XQUANT-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the embeddings for extreme compression. Across different models, XQUANT-CL attains up to 10 memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01 perplexity degradation, and 12.5 memory savings with only 0.1 perplexity degradation. Notably, despite using standard uniform quantization, XQUANT-CL is able to surpass intricate KV cache quantization methods that employ non-uniform quantization with outlier-aware strategies. Given the aforementioned trends in compute versus memory scaling for future generations of hardware platforms, XQUANT adopts forward-looking perspective to accelerate LLM inference: XQUANT seeks to exploit the rapidly increasing compute capabilities to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving near-FP16 accuracy across wide range of models.Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption as standard paradigm across range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications [6, 3, 31, 34]. While LLMs achieve remarkable performance on these tasks, they have substantial inference costs due to their large parameter count as well as the number of memory operations required when running generation. Prior work has demonstrated how LLM inference tends to be Memory BandwidthBound, rather than Compute-Bound [20, 33, 27], and therefore reducing the memory footprint of LLMs is critical to enable downstream applications. For short context lengths and small batch sizes, the model weights are typically the memory bottleneck. However, for long context lengths and large batch sizes, the main memory bottleneck for LLM inference is the Key-Value (KV) cache, which is the embedded representation of the entire sequence used in the self-attention mechanism and which grows linearly with respect to the sequence length [33, 27]. During inference, generating each new token requires repeatedly loading and storing the entire KV cache, which becomes prohibitively expensive and leads to substantial slowdown. This motivates efforts to reduce KV cache memory operations to speed up the inference process. One promising solution to compress the KV cache is through KV cache quantization [15, 23]. *Equal Contribution 1 Figure 1: Perplexity degradation (lower is better) versus memory compression factor (higher is better) evaluated using Llama-2-7B on WikiText-2 for state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and for our XQUANT, across {4,3,2}-bit widths. The top right edge of the plot represents the optimal configuration that attains the most memory compression and the least perplexity degradation. Memory compression factor and perplexity degradation are with respect to the FP16 baseline. As shown in Table 4, XQUANT-CL achieves only 0.01 perplexity degradation while getting 10 memory savings with 3-bit quantization, and 0.1 perplexity degradation while getting 12.5 memory compression with 2-bit quantization. Quantizing the KV cache reduces the memory footprint and number of memory operations required during decoding by using fewer bits to represent the Keys and Values. However, while existing methods retain accuracy even when quantizing the KV cache to low precision (e.g., 4-bit quantization), further reducing the bit-width of KV activations often degrades model performance. In this work, we present XQUANT, method which quantizes the input activations of each layer, rather than the KV cache, to reduce the required memory consumption. Our method is visualized in Figure 2. Quantizing provides 2 memory savings compared with quantizing the KV cache, since we only need to store one tensor per layer instead of separate Keys and Values. Interestingly, we also find that is more amenable to extremely low-bit quantization than the KV cache. Moreover, although rematerializing KV cache from requires additional computation during decoding, we can afford this cost because LLM inference is progressively becoming more memory-bandwidth bound. This phenomenon will be increasingly prevalent with future hardware platforms, as the rate of improvement in compute capabilities continue to outpace increases in memory bandwidth and capacity [11]. In this work, we make the following contributions (which are summarized in Figure 1): To reduce the memory consumption for LLM inference, XQUANT quantizes the input activations, providing 2 memory savings relative to quantizing the KV cache directly, and then rematerializes the KV activations on-the-fly during inference (see Section 3.1). We show that for the same memory footprint ( 7.7 savings compared to FP16), XQUANT attains up to 0.9 less perplexity degradation compared to KV cache quantization and < 0.1 perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline (see Section 4.1). For ultra-low precision quantization with accuracy comparable to the FP16 baseline, we present XQUANT-CL, method that exploits the cross-"

LLMs can serve as efficient simulators for RL tasks, reducing reliance on external search engines through a method called Self-Search RL, which enhances internal knowledge utilization.  					AI-generated summary 				 We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks, including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support more scalable RL agent training.

"LLMs can serve as efficient simulators for RL tasks, reducing reliance on external search engines through a method called Self-Search RL, which enhances internal knowledge utilization.  					AI-generated summary 				 We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks, including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support more scalable RL agent training."

DINOv3, a self-supervised learning model, achieves superior performance across various vision tasks by scaling datasets and models, addressing dense feature degradation, and enhancing flexibility with post-hoc strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

XQuant and XQuant-CL reduce memory consumption in LLM inference through low-bit quantization and cross-layer similarity exploitation, achieving significant memory savings with minimal accuracy loss.  					AI-generated summary 				 Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X, instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2times memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to sim 7.7times memory savings with <0.1 perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to 10times memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01 perplexity degradation, and 12.5times memory savings with only 0.1 perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X, instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2times memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to sim 7.7times memory savings with <0.1 perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to 10times memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01 perplexity degradation, and 12.5times memory savings with only 0.1 perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models."

MAESTRO, an adapted Masked Autoencoder with optimized fusion strategies and spectral prior normalization, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multitemporal Earth observation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at https://github.com/ignf/maestro.
