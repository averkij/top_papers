Text:"BeyondWeb: Lessons from Scaling Synthetic Data for Trillion-scale PretrainingLessons from Scaling Synthetic Data for Trillion-scale Pretraining DatologyAI TeamRecent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that simply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting data wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged as promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this, the factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce BeyondWeb, synthetic data generation framework that produces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly extends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and Nemotron-CCs high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1 percentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across suite of 14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7 faster training than open web data and 2.7 faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, 3B model trained for 180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token budget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on synthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to rephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality. Overall, our work shows that theres no silver bullet for generating high-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly optimizing many factors, challenging task that requires rigorous science and practical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements, potentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative improvements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb. Figure 1: Left: BeyondWeb establishes new Pareto frontier for synthetic pretraining data. Notably, our 3B model outperforms all but one 8B model trained on baseline datasets with the same token budget. Average Accuracy (%) is the mean across 14 benchmarks. 1B model trained for 1T tokens; 3B and 8B models for 180B tokens. Right: For 8B model, we achieve up to 7.7 and 2.7 speedup (in time to reach baseline accuracy) over RedPajama and Nemotron-Synth respectively. 1See Contributions and Acknowledgements ( 7) for full author list. 1 5 2 0 2 4 ] . [ 1 5 7 9 0 1 . 8 0 5 2 : r BeyondWeb: Lessons from Scaling Synthetic Data for Trillion-scale PretrainingUntil 2024, breakthroughs in language modeling followed predictable recipe: train ever-larger models on exponentially larger internet-scraped datasets. However, as the scale of data collection ballooned into the trillions of tokens, the field began to encounter data wall, beyond which data of high information-density becomes prohibitively scarce. The returns on collecting more internet data rapidly diminished, pushing researchers toward exploring alternative paradigms. Synthetic data has emerged as powerful complement to scarce, high-quality web text. Initial evidence from Tiny Stories (Eldan and Li, 2023) showed that targeted prompting of large language models can generate data suitable to train small language models from scratch. Follow-up work, most notably Microsofts Phi family (Li et al., 2023) and the open-source Cosmopedia corpus (Ben Allal et al., 2024), demonstrated that sub-2B models jointly trained on synthetic and raw data can outperform much larger baselines. We refer to this practice of using large models to generate training data de novo as the generator-driven approach. Generator-driven approaches, while powerful, are ultimately limited by the cost and idiosyncrasies of the large generator models they rely on, such as GPT-4 (Maini, 2023). To address these limitations, the Web Rephrase Augmented Pre-training (WRAP) paradigm (Maini et al., 2024) and its refinement in Nemotron-CC (Su et al., 2024) developed what we refer to as the source rephrasing approach. In these works, rather than prompting large LLM to create knowledge de novo, small LLMs are used to rephrase existing web data into higher-quality, task-aligned formats (e.g., Q&A pairs, instructional passages). This approach achieves superior coverage and diversity at lower compute costs, establishing synthetic rephrasing as practical solution for pretraining-scale data generation. The success of synthetic data methods has led research organizations to pour substantial compute resources into creating ever larger corpora of rephrased synthetic data (KimiTeam et al., 2025; Hui et al., 2024; xAI, 2025). Most recently, synthetic data was specifically highlighted as key innovation in GPT-5s development (OpenAI, 2025). While we know that synthetic pretraining data can work, we still lack comprehensive scientific understanding of the factors that determine when and how synthetic pretraining data works. Our work systematically addresses these questions and highlights the challenges of scalably generating high-quality pretraining data by conducting experiments across model scales up to 8B parameters. Specifically, we address the following: How Does Synthetic Data Provide its Benefits? First, we assess whether the model quality improvements imparted by the generator-driven paradigm can be explained as distillation of teacher models knowledge into higher per-token information density data. We find that simple summarization prompts in the source-rephrasing paradigm can match the performance of generator-driven approaches such as Cosmopedia (4.2). Next, we ask whether synthetic data can actually breach the data wall. We show that in dataconstrained setting, naive approaches such as simple continuations (of existing web data) provide limited accuracy improvements over just repeating data. However, thoughtfully-created data that fills in the distributional gaps of the web data has much larger benefits. What and How to Rephrase? First, data quality matters: rephrasing high-quality data provides benefits over using lowerquality sources, but high-quality input data alone is not enough to yield the highest quality synthetic data (4.4). Second, distributional style matching is important. Web data contains only 2.7% conversational content, despite chat being major inference use case. Style matching improves performance in 2 BeyondWeb: Lessons from Scaling Synthetic Data for Trillion-scale Pretraining downstream tasks, but the benefits saturate quickly with the proportion of c"

"BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework, outperforms existing datasets and accelerates training for large language models by optimizing multiple factors.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that simply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting a data wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged as a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this, the factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that produces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly extends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and Nemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1 percentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of 14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web data and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for 180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token budget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on synthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to rephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality. Overall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating high-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly optimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and practical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements, potentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative improvements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb."
