Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-theart results in computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains largely opaque limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical applications, where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, selfexplaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct structured context vector encoding interpretable cues, such as degree, centrality, clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into compact explanation vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the nodes latent embedding via Decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating natural language explanation using pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3) guiding the GNN itself via text-injection mechanism that feeds explanations back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT, and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations. https://github.com/basiralab/X-Node.1 Keywords: Graph Neural Network Graph Topological Measures Interpretable Explainable AI Natural Language Processing Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling structured medical data, such as cellular interactions in histopathology, org"

"X-Node is a self-explaining GNN framework that generates per-node explanations by encoding local topology features and integrating them into the message-passing pipeline, maintaining accuracy while enhancing interpretability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality, clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3) guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT, and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations. Repository: https://github.com/basiralab/X-Node."
