In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), vision transformers (ViTs) are widely employed for visual encoding. However, their performance in solving universal MLLM tasks is not satisfactory. We attribute it to a lack of information from diverse visual levels, impeding alignment with the various semantic granularity required for language generation. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v2, an advanced MLLM centered around a Hierarchical window transformer that enables capturing diverse visual granularity by constructing and integrating a high-resolution feature pyramid. As a vision-language projector, Hiwin transformer comprises two primary modules: (i) an inverse feature pyramid, constructed by a ViT-derived feature up-sampling process utilizing high-frequency details from an image pyramid, and (ii) hierarchical window attention, focusing on a set of key sampling features within cross-scale windows to condense multi-level feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-UHD v2 achieves superior performance over existing MLLMs on popular benchmarks. Notably, our design brings an average boost of 3.7% across 14 benchmarks compared with the baseline method, 9.3% on DocVQA for instance. We make all the data, model checkpoint, and code publicly available to facilitate future research.

"In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), vision transformers (ViTs) are widely employed for visual encoding. However, their performance in solving universal MLLM tasks is not satisfactory. We attribute it to a lack of information from diverse visual levels, impeding alignment with the various semantic granularity required for language generation. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v2, an advanced MLLM centered around a Hierarchical window transformer that enables capturing diverse visual granularity by constructing and integrating a high-resolution feature pyramid. As a vision-language projector, Hiwin transformer comprises two primary modules: (i) an inverse feature pyramid, constructed by a ViT-derived feature up-sampling process utilizing high-frequency details from an image pyramid, and (ii) hierarchical window attention, focusing on a set of key sampling features within cross-scale windows to condense multi-level feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-UHD v2 achieves superior performance over existing MLLMs on popular benchmarks. Notably, our design brings an average boost of 3.7% across 14 benchmarks compared with the baseline method, 9.3% on DocVQA for instance. We make all the data, model checkpoint, and code publicly available to facilitate future research."
