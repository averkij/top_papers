Text:"4 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 1 7 5 2 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r CHATDIT: TRAINING-FREE BASELINE FOR TASK-AGNOSTIC FREE-FORM CHATTING WITH DIFFUSION TRANSFORMERSLianghua Huang* Wei Wang Zhi-Fan Wu Yupeng Shi Chen Liang Tong Shen Han Zhang Huanzhang Dou Yu Liu Jingren Zhou Tongyi LabRecent research [Huang et al., 2024a,b] has highlighted the inherent in-context generation capabilities of pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs), enabling them to seamlessly adapt to diverse visual tasks with minimal or no architectural modifications. These capabilities are unlocked by concatenating self-attention tokens across multiple input and target images, combined with grouped and masked generation pipelines. Building upon this foundation, we present ChatDiT, zero-shot, general-purpose, and interactive visual generation framework that leverages pretrained diffusion transformers in their original form, requiring no additional tuning, adapters, or modifications. Users can interact with ChatDiT to create interleaved text-image articles, multi-page picture books, edit images, design IP derivatives, or develop character design settings, all through free-form natural language across one or more conversational rounds. At its core, ChatDiT employs multi-agent system comprising three key components: an Instruction-Parsing agent that interprets user-uploaded images and instructions, Strategy-Planning agent that devises single-step or multi-step generation actions, and an Execution agent that performs these actions using an in-context toolkit of diffusion transformers. We thoroughly evaluate ChatDiT on IDEA-Bench [Liang et al., 2024], comprising 100 real-world design tasks and 275 cases with diverse instructions and varying numbers of input and target images. Despite its simplicity and training-free approach, ChatDiT surpasses all competitors, including those specifically designed and trained on extensive multi-task datasets. While this work highlights the untapped potential of pretrained text-to-image models for zero-shot task generalization, we note that ChatDiTs Top-1 performance on IDEA-Bench achieves score of 23.19 out of 100, reflecting challenges in fully exploiting DiTs for general-purpose generation. We further identify key limitations of pretrained DiTs in zero-shot adapting to tasks. We release all code, agents, results, and intermediate outputs to facilitate further research at https://github.com/ali-vilab/ChatDiT. Keywords ChatDiT Zero-shot task generalization Diffusion transformers Image generationRecent advances in text-to-image models have enabled the generation of high-quality images with remarkable fidelity to prompts [Ramesh et al., 2021, Esser et al., 2021, Ramesh et al., 2022, Rombach et al., 2022, Saharia et al., 2022a, Corresponding Author Emails: Lianghua Huang, Wei Wang, Zhi-Fan Wu, Tong Shen, Yu Liu, Jingren Zhou {xuangen.hlh, ww413411, wuzhifan.wzf, st456222, ly103369, jingren.zhou}@alibaba-inc.com, and Yupeng Shi (shiyupeng.syp@taobao.com). Chen Liang (liangchen2022@ia.ac.cn, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences), Han Zhang (hzhang9617@gmail.com, Shanghai Jiao Tong University) and Huanzhang Dou (hzdou@zju.edu.cn, Zhejiang University) contributed to this work during internships at Tongyi Lab. ChatDiT: Training-Free Baseline for Task-Agnostic Free-Form Chatting with Diffusion Transformers Figure 1: Overview of the ChatDiT multi-agent framework. The framework consists of three core agents operating sequentially: the Instruction-Parsing Agent interprets user instructions and analyzes inputs, the Strategy-Planning Agent formulates in-context generation strategies, and the Execution Agent performs the planned actions using pretrained diffusion transformers. An optional Markdown Agent integrates the outputs into cohesive, illustrated articles. Sub-agents handle specialized tasks within each core agent, ensuring flexibility and precision in generation. Betker et al., 2023, Podell et al., 2023, Esser et al., 2024, Baldridge et al., 2024, Labs, 2024]. Additionally, variety of adapters have been developed to enhance the controllability of these models [Zhang et al., 2023, Ye et al., 2023, Huang et al., 2023, Ruiz et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2024a, Hertz et al., 2024]. However, real-world applications often involve complex requirements that surpass the limitations of existing adapters. For instance, generating picture book necessitates maintaining compositional consistency and intricate variations across multitude of elements. While recent efforts have sought to develop unified models capable of handling diverse tasks [Ge et al., 2023, Zhou et al., 2024a, Sheynin et al., 2024, Sun et al., 2024, Wang et al., 2024b], these approaches typically rely on large amounts of task-specific data and extensive multi-task training. Although such models exhibit zero-shot generalization capabilities, they tend to lack stability on unseen tasks, are challenging to scale, and fail to leverage abundant task-agnostic data effectively. Emerging work, such as Group Diffusion Transformers [Huang et al., 2024a], has proposed task-agnostic approach by utilizing group data for training. This method allows for the incorporation of diverse relational data sources, such as illustrated articles, video frames, and picture books, making the training data highly redundant. These models demonstrate the potential for zero-shot generalization across various tasks. Building on this, In-context LoRA [Huang et al., 2024b] simplifies the concept by highlighting the inherent in-context generation capabilities of text-to-image diffusion transformers. By fine-tuning these transformers with small dataset of 10100 image groups per task, In-context LoRA achieves impressive results across range of tasks. However, its reliance on per-task training limits its ability to generalize to unseen tasks. In this work, we aim to maximize the potential of the core observation underlying In-context LoRA [Huang et al., 2024b]: that diffusion transformers inherently possess in-context generation capabilities, and consequently, zero-shot task generalization potential. We propose training-free, zero-shot, interactive, and general-purpose image generation framework built directly upon diffusion transformers in their original form, without the need for fine-tuning, adapters, or structural modifications. We begin by introducing an in-context toolkit for diffusion transformers, enabling them to generate sets of images (instead of single outputs) conditioned"

[ 1 6 4 7 3 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r Despite the significant progress made by existing retrieval augmented language models (RALMs) in providing trustworthy responses and grounding in reliable sources, they often overlook effective alignment with human preferences. In the alignment process, reward models (RMs) act as crucial proxy for human values to guide optimization. However, it remains unclear how to evaluate and select reliable RM for preference alignment in RALMs. To this end, we propose RAG-RewardBench, the first benchmark for evaluating RMs in RAG settings. First, we design four crucial and challenging RAG-specific scenarios to assess RMs, including multi-hop reasoning, fine-grained citation, appropriate abstain, and conflict robustness. Then, we incorporate 18 RAG subsets, six retrievers, and 24 RALMs to increase the diversity of data sources. Finally, we adopt an LLMas-a-judge approach to improve preference annotation efficiency and effectiveness, exhibiting strong correlation with human annotations. Based on the RAG-RewardBench, we conduct comprehensive evaluation of 45 RMs and uncover their limitations in RAG scenarios. Additionally, we also reveal that existing trained RALMs show almost no improvement in preference alignment, highlighting the need for shift towards preference-aligned training.

We interact with computers on an everyday basis, be it in everyday life or work, and many aspects of work can be done entirely with access to a computer and the Internet. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at helping to accelerate or even autonomously perform work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications for both industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper, we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most competitive agent, 24% of the tasks can be completed autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents -- in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems.

"We interact with computers on an everyday basis, be it in everyday life or work, and many aspects of work can be done entirely with access to a computer and the Internet. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at helping to accelerate or even autonomously perform work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications for both industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper, we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most competitive agent, 24% of the tasks can be completed autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents -- in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems."

Recent research arXiv:2410.15027 arXiv:2410.23775 has highlighted the inherent in-context generation capabilities of pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs), enabling them to seamlessly adapt to diverse visual tasks with minimal or no architectural modifications. These capabilities are unlocked by concatenating self-attention tokens across multiple input and target images, combined with grouped and masked generation pipelines. Building upon this foundation, we present ChatDiT, a zero-shot, general-purpose, and interactive visual generation framework that leverages pretrained diffusion transformers in their original form, requiring no additional tuning, adapters, or modifications. Users can interact with ChatDiT to create interleaved text-image articles, multi-page picture books, edit images, design IP derivatives, or develop character design settings, all through free-form natural language across one or more conversational rounds. At its core, ChatDiT employs a multi-agent system comprising three key components: an Instruction-Parsing agent that interprets user-uploaded images and instructions, a Strategy-Planning agent that devises single-step or multi-step generation actions, and an Execution agent that performs these actions using an in-context toolkit of diffusion transformers. We thoroughly evaluate ChatDiT on IDEA-Bench arXiv:2412.11767, comprising 100 real-world design tasks and 275 cases with diverse instructions and varying numbers of input and target images. Despite its simplicity and training-free approach, ChatDiT surpasses all competitors, including those specifically designed and trained on extensive multi-task datasets. We further identify key limitations of pretrained DiTs in zero-shot adapting to tasks. We release all code, agents, results, and intermediate outputs to facilitate further research at https://github.com/ali-vilab/ChatDiT

Despite the significant progress made by existing retrieval augmented language models (RALMs) in providing trustworthy responses and grounding in reliable sources, they often overlook effective alignment with human preferences. In the alignment process, reward models (RMs) act as a crucial proxy for human values to guide optimization. However, it remains unclear how to evaluate and select a reliable RM for preference alignment in RALMs. To this end, we propose RAG-RewardBench, the first benchmark for evaluating RMs in RAG settings. First, we design four crucial and challenging RAG-specific scenarios to assess RMs, including multi-hop reasoning, fine-grained citation, appropriate abstain, and conflict robustness. Then, we incorporate 18 RAG subsets, six retrievers, and 24 RALMs to increase the diversity of data sources. Finally, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge approach to improve preference annotation efficiency and effectiveness, exhibiting a strong correlation with human annotations. Based on the RAG-RewardBench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 45 RMs and uncover their limitations in RAG scenarios. Additionally, we also reveal that existing trained RALMs show almost no improvement in preference alignment, highlighting the need for a shift towards preference-aligned training.We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jinzhuoran/RAG-RewardBench/ for future work.

Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents, powered by Large Foundation Models, have emerged as a transformative approach to automating human-computer interaction. These agents autonomously interact with digital systems or software applications via GUIs, emulating human actions such as clicking, typing, and navigating visual elements across diverse platforms. Motivated by the growing interest and fundamental importance of GUI agents, we provide a comprehensive survey that categorizes their benchmarks, evaluation metrics, architectures, and training methods. We propose a unified framework that delineates their perception, reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities. Furthermore, we identify important open challenges and discuss key future directions. Finally, this work serves as a basis for practitioners and researchers to gain an intuitive understanding of current progress, techniques, benchmarks, and critical open problems that remain to be addressed.

Encoding video content into compact latent tokens has become a fundamental step in video generation and understanding, driven by the need to address the inherent redundancy in pixel-level representations. Consequently, there is a growing demand for high-performance, open-source video tokenizers as video-centric research gains prominence. We introduce VidTok, a versatile video tokenizer that delivers state-of-the-art performance in both continuous and discrete tokenizations. VidTok incorporates several key advancements over existing approaches: 1) model architecture such as convolutional layers and up/downsampling modules; 2) to address the training instability and codebook collapse commonly associated with conventional Vector Quantization (VQ), we integrate Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) into discrete video tokenization; 3) improved training strategies, including a two-stage training process and the use of reduced frame rates. By integrating these advancements, VidTok achieves substantial improvements over existing methods, demonstrating superior performance across multiple metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and FVD, under standardized evaluation settings.

Prompts play a critical role in unleashing the power of language and vision foundation models for specific tasks. For the first time, we introduce prompting into depth foundation models, creating a new paradigm for metric depth estimation termed Prompt Depth Anything. Specifically, we use a low-cost LiDAR as the prompt to guide the Depth Anything model for accurate metric depth output, achieving up to 4K resolution. Our approach centers on a concise prompt fusion design that integrates the LiDAR at multiple scales within the depth decoder. To address training challenges posed by limited datasets containing both LiDAR depth and precise GT depth, we propose a scalable data pipeline that includes synthetic data LiDAR simulation and real data pseudo GT depth generation. Our approach sets new state-of-the-arts on the ARKitScenes and ScanNet++ datasets and benefits downstream applications, including 3D reconstruction and generalized robotic grasping.
