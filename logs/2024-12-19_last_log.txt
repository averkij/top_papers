Text:"Thinking in Space: How Multimodal Large Language Models See, Remember, and Recall Spaces Jihan Yang1* Shusheng Yang1 Anjali W.

Whether at home, in the workplace, or elsewhere, the ability to perceive space, remember its layout, and retrieve this spatial information to answer questions on demand is key aspect of visual-spatial intelligence. Recent Multimodal LLMs can understand general videos, but can they think spatially when presented with video recording of an environment? Can they build an accurate, implicit cognitive map that allows them to answer questions about space? What are the strengths and limitations of using MLLMs to enhance spatial intelligence? We dig into these questions by setting up video data for MLLMs to watch, building VQA benchmark to check their recall, and examining what the MLLMs actually remember and understand. "

Text:"4 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 3 0 3 3 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r FastVLM: Efficient Vision Encoding for Vision Language Models Pavan Kumar Anasosalu Vasu Nate True Fartash Faghri Gokul Santhanam Chun-Liang Li James Gabriel Cem Koc Peter Grasch Oncel Tuzel Hadi Pouransari Apple {panasosaluvasu,fartash,chunliang li,cem koc,otuzel,mpouransari}@apple.com Core authors; Project lead image resolution is essential for enhancing the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs), particularly in text-rich image understanding tasks. However, popular visual encoders such as ViTs become inefficient at high resolutions due to the large number of tokens and high encoding latency caused by stacked selfattention layers. At different operational resolutions, the vision encoder of VLM can be optimized along two axes: reducing encoding latency and minimizing the number of visual tokens passed to the LLM, thereby lowering overall latency. Based on comprehensive efficiency analysis of the interplay between image resolution, vision latency, token count, and LLM size, we introduce FastVLMa model that achieves an optimized trade-off between latency, model size and accuracy. FastVLM incorporates FastViTHD, novel hybrid vision encoder designed to output fewer tokens and significantly reduce encoding time for high-resolution images. Unlike previous methods, FastVLM achieves the optimal balance between visual token count and image resolution solely by scaling the input image, eliminating the need for additional token pruning and simplifying the model design. improvement in time-to-first-token (TTFT) while maintaining similar performance on VLM benchmarks compared to prior works. Compared to LLaVa-OneVision at the highest resolution (1152 1152), FastVLM achieves comparable performance on key benchmarks like SeedBench and MMMU, using the same 0.5B LLM, but with 85 faster TTFT and vision encoder that is 3.4 In the LLaVA-1.5 setup, FastVLM achieves 3.2 smaller. 1.

Humans possess the visual-spatial intelligence to remember spaces from sequential visual observations. However, can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on million-scale video datasets also ``think in space'' from videos? We present a novel video-based visual-spatial intelligence benchmark (VSI-Bench) of over 5,000 question-answer pairs, and find that MLLMs exhibit competitive - though subhuman - visual-spatial intelligence. We probe models to express how they think in space both linguistically and visually and find that while spatial reasoning capabilities remain the primary bottleneck for MLLMs to reach higher benchmark performance, local world models and spatial awareness do emerge within these models. Notably, prevailing linguistic reasoning techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought, self-consistency, tree-of-thoughts) fail to improve performance, whereas explicitly generating cognitive maps during question-answering enhances MLLMs' spatial distance ability.

Scaling the input image resolution is essential for enhancing the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs), particularly in text-rich image understanding tasks. However, popular visual encoders such as ViTs become inefficient at high resolutions due to the large number of tokens and high encoding latency caused by stacked self-attention layers. At different operational resolutions, the vision encoder of a VLM can be optimized along two axes: reducing encoding latency and minimizing the number of visual tokens passed to the LLM, thereby lowering overall latency. Based on a comprehensive efficiency analysis of the interplay between image resolution, vision latency, token count, and LLM size, we introduce FastVLM, a model that achieves an optimized trade-off between latency, model size and accuracy. FastVLM incorporates FastViTHD, a novel hybrid vision encoder designed to output fewer tokens and significantly reduce encoding time for high-resolution images. Unlike previous methods, FastVLM achieves the optimal balance between visual token count and image resolution solely by scaling the input image, eliminating the need for additional token pruning and simplifying the model design. In the LLaVA-1.5 setup, FastVLM achieves 3.2times improvement in time-to-first-token (TTFT) while maintaining similar performance on VLM benchmarks compared to prior works. Compared to LLaVa-OneVision at the highest resolution (1152times1152), FastVLM achieves comparable performance on key benchmarks like SeedBench and MMMU, using the same 0.5B LLM, but with 85times faster TTFT and a vision encoder that is 3.4times smaller.
