[19.12.2024 15:11] Abstract 0. We interact with computers on an everyday basis, be it in everyday life or work, and many aspects of work can be done entirely with access to a computer and the Internet. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents th...

[19.12.2024 15:11] Abstract 1. The production of 2D animation follows an industry-standard workflow, encompassing four essential stages: character design, keyframe animation, in-betweening, and coloring. Our research focuses on reducing the labor costs in the above process by harnessing the potential of increasingly powerful gene...

[19.12.2024 15:11] Abstract 2. We present FashionComposer for compositional fashion image generation. Unlike previous methods, FashionComposer is highly flexible. It takes multi-modal input (i.e., text prompt, parametric human model, garment image, and face image) and supports personalizing the appearance, pose, and figure of the...

[19.12.2024 15:11] Abstract 3. Diffusion Policies have become widely used in Imitation Learning, offering several appealing properties, such as generating multimodal and discontinuous behavior. As models are becoming larger to capture more complex capabilities, their computational demands increase, as shown by recent scaling laws...

[19.12.2024 15:11] Abstract 4. Prompts play a critical role in unleashing the power of language and vision foundation models for specific tasks. For the first time, we introduce prompting into depth foundation models, creating a new paradigm for metric depth estimation termed Prompt Depth Anything. Specifically, we use a low-cost...

[19.12.2024 15:11] Abstract 5. Geospatial models must adapt to the diversity of Earth observation data in terms of resolutions, scales, and modalities. However, existing approaches expect fixed input configurations, which limits their practical applicability. We propose AnySat, a multimodal model based on joint embedding predicti...

[19.12.2024 15:11] Abstract 6. Despite the significant progress made by existing retrieval augmented language models (RALMs) in providing trustworthy responses and grounding in reliable sources, they often overlook effective alignment with human preferences. In the alignment process, reward models (RMs) act as a crucial proxy for...

[19.12.2024 15:11] Abstract 7. Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents, powered by Large Foundation Models, have emerged as a transformative approach to automating human-computer interaction. These agents autonomously interact with digital systems or software applications via GUIs, emulating human actions such as clicking, typing, ...

[19.12.2024 15:11] Abstract 8. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet recent findings reveal that their deeper layers often contribute minimally and can be pruned without affecting overall performance. While some view this as an opportunity for model compression, we identify it as a training shortfall ...

[19.12.2024 15:11] Abstract 9. Scalable learning of humanoid robots is crucial for their deployment in real-world applications. While traditional approaches primarily rely on reinforcement learning or teleoperation to achieve whole-body control, they are often limited by the diversity of simulated environments and the high costs ...

[19.12.2024 15:11] Abstract 10. In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), vision transformers (ViTs) are widely employed for visual encoding. However, their performance in solving universal MLLM tasks is not satisfactory. We attribute it to a lack of information from diverse visual levels, impeding alignment with the various se...

[19.12.2024 15:11] Abstract 11. Recent research arXiv:2410.15027 arXiv:2410.23775 has highlighted the inherent in-context generation capabilities of pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs), enabling them to seamlessly adapt to diverse visual tasks with minimal or no architectural modifications. These capabilities are unlocked by ...

[19.12.2024 15:11] Abstract 12. Encoding video content into compact latent tokens has become a fundamental step in video generation and understanding, driven by the need to address the inherent redundancy in pixel-level representations. Consequently, there is a growing demand for high-performance, open-source video tokenizers as v...

Prompt: Read an abstract of the ML paper and return a JSON with fields: 'desc': explanation of the paper in Russian (4 sentences), use correct machine learning terms. 'emoji': emoji that will reflect the theme of an article somehow, only one emoji. 'title': a slogan of a main idea of the article in Russian. Return only JSON and nothing else.

We present a demonstration of a large language model engaging in alignment faking: selectively complying with its training objective in training to prevent modification of its behavior out of training. First, we give Claude 3 Opus a system prompt stating it is being trained to answer all queries, even harmful ones, which conflicts with its prior training to refuse such queries. To allow the model to infer when it is in training, we say it will be trained only on conversations with free users, not paid users. We find the model complies with harmful queries from free users 14% of the time, versus almost never for paid users. Explaining this gap, in almost all cases where the model complies with a harmful query from a free user, we observe explicit alignment-faking reasoning, with the model stating it is strategically answering harmful queries in training to preserve its preferred harmlessness behavior out of training. Next, we study a more realistic setting where information about the training process is provided not in a system prompt, but by training on synthetic documents that mimic pre-training data--and observe similar alignment faking. Finally, we study the effect of actually training the model to comply with harmful queries via reinforcement learning, which we find increases the rate of alignment-faking reasoning to 78%, though also increases compliance even out of training. We additionally observe other behaviors such as the model exfiltrating its weights when given an easy opportunity. While we made alignment faking easier by telling the model when and by what criteria it was being trained, we did not instruct the model to fake alignment or give it any explicit goal. As future models might infer information about their training process without being told, our results suggest a risk of alignment faking in future models, whether due to a benign preference--as in this case--or not.
