Text:"No More Adam: Learning Rate Scaling at Initialization is All You Need Minghao Xu * 1 Lichuan Xiang * 1 2 Xu Cai 2 Hongkai Wen 1 4 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 2 8 6 7 1 1 . 2 1 4 2 : r aIn this work, we question the necessity of adaptive gradient methods for training deep neural networks. SGD-SaI is simple yet effective enhancement to stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM). SGD-SaI performs learning rate Scaling at Initialization (SaI) to distinct parameter groups, guided by their respective gradient signal-to-noise ratios (g-SNR). By adjusting learning rates without relying on adaptive second-order momentum, SGD-SaI helps prevent training imbalances from the very first iteration and cuts the optimizers memory usage by half compared to AdamW. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, SGD-SaI consistently matches or outperforms AdamW in training variety of Transformer-based tasks, effectively overcoming long-standing challenge of using SGD for training Transformers. SGD-SaI excels in ImageNet1K classification with Vision Transformers(ViT) and GPT-2 pretraining for large language models (LLMs, transformer decoder-only), demonstrating robustness to hyperparameter variations and practicality for diverse applications. We further tested its robustness on tasks like LoRA fine-tuning for LLMs and diffusion models, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers. From memory efficiency perspective, SGD-SaI achieves substantial memory savings for optimizer states, reducing memory usage by 5.93 GB for GPT-2 (1.5B parameters) and 25.15 GB for Llama2-7B compared to AdamW in full-precision training settings. 1 *Equal contribution 1Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK 2Collov Labs. Correspondence to: Hongkai Wen <hongkai.wen@warwick.ac.uk>. 1The PyTorch implementation is available at https:// github.com/AnonymousAlethiometer/SGD_SaI/ 1 Figure 1. The chart illustrates how memory usage and optimizer step time (in wall-clock time) increase with larger model sizes. It highlights the substantial memory overhead of storing optimizer states as model sizes grow. SGD-SaI exhibits significantly lower memory usage than AdamW and has the shortest optimization step runtime. This runtime refers to the wall clock time required for the optimizer step function. All statistics were measured on single NVIDIA A100-80GB. 1. Introduction Stochastic gradient-based optimization methods, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), are fundamental to modern machine learning, enabling the successful training of models across wide range of scientific and engineering applications. However, training objectives and data are often noisy in practice, and gradients may become sparse due to the inherent characteristics of regularization or specific architectural designs. Moreover, architectural differences can introduce imbalances in the learning dynamics across different parameters. To address these challenges, adaptive gradient methods (Ghorbani et al., 2022) have been developed to handle better non-stationary objectives, noisy data, and sparse gradients. Among these methods, Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) and AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) have become indispensable for training Transformer-based models, No More Adam: Learning Rate Scaling at Initialization is All You Need Figure 2. This graph illustrates the differences in local gain behaviours exhibited by four optimizers throughout the training process. We present two popular adaptive gradient methods: Adam(W) and the memory-efficient Adam-mini. The local gains for these methods are recalculated continuously at each step based on the gradients. In contrast, SGD and SGD-SaI are both non-adaptive methods, meaning their local gains remain fixed throughout the training. including Large Language Models (LLMs) (Radford et al., 2019; Team et al., 2023) and Diffusion Models (DMs) (Ho et al., 2020; Rombach et al., 2022). Their popularity stems from their relative robustness and efficiency in optimizing high-dimensional parameter spaces. The core mechanism of Adams adaptability lies in its second-order momentum term, v, which acts as local gain (Hinton et al., 2012), dynamically adjusting the learning rate for each parameter. This mechanism enables Adam to perform effectively even in noisy or sparse gradients, addressing imbalances in the learning process across different parameters. However, this adaptability comes with significant costs when the model size scales up. Specifically, Adam requires storing and updating each parameters first-order (mean) and second-order (variance) momentum terms. This increases memory usage by at least 3x compared to the parameter size alone. For instance, training 7-billion parameter model in FP32 using Adam requires approximately 50 GB of memory for the state tensors, significant challenge even with high-end hardware like NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs. Compared to SGD, the memory demand of Adam can be at least double (Zhang et al., 2024b), posing severe limitation on the scalability of deep learning research. Numerous previous works have sought to reduce memory usage by simplifying optimizer states while preserving the adaptive gradient term to address the memory bottleneck while maintaining the effectiveness of adaptive methods. Approaches such as 8-bit Adam (Dettmers et al., 2021), Adafactor (Shazeer & Stern, 2018), and sign-based methods (Bernstein et al., 2018; Kunstner et al., 2023) focus on quantizing or sparsifying the optimizer states. Meanwhile, Adam-mini (Zhang et al., 2024b) introduces parameter block grouping to share adaptive learning rates, leveraging Hessian structure insights (Zhang et al., 2024a) to reduce memory usage. However, these methods often come with trade-offs. Many risk performance downgrade compared to AdamW. From an efficiency standpoint, these approaches also introduce additional update complexity. Simplified state tensors still require computations based on full gradients for each parameter at each time step, increasing the overall computational burden. Adam-mini, in particular, necessitates fine-grained parameter partitioning (Zhang et al., 2024b), further complicating its implementation. As result, these limitations lead to longer optimizer step times, ultimately slowing down the training process. In this work, we challenge the necessity of adaptive gradient methods for model training and propose memoryand computation-efficient alternative. We begin by revisiting the foundational motivation"

In this work, we question the necessity of adaptive gradient methods for training deep neural networks. SGD-SaI is a simple yet effective enhancement to stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM). SGD-SaI performs learning rate Scaling at Initialization (SaI) to distinct parameter groups, guided by their respective gradient signal-to-noise ratios (g-SNR). By adjusting learning rates without relying on adaptive second-order momentum, SGD-SaI helps prevent training imbalances from the very first iteration and cuts the optimizer's memory usage by half compared to AdamW. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, SGD-SaI consistently matches or outperforms AdamW in training a variety of Transformer-based tasks, effectively overcoming a long-standing challenge of using SGD for training Transformers. SGD-SaI excels in ImageNet-1K classification with Vision Transformers(ViT) and GPT-2 pretraining for large language models (LLMs, transformer decoder-only), demonstrating robustness to hyperparameter variations and practicality for diverse applications. We further tested its robustness on tasks like LoRA fine-tuning for LLMs and diffusion models, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers. From a memory efficiency perspective, SGD-SaI achieves substantial memory savings for optimizer states, reducing memory usage by 5.93 GB for GPT-2 (1.5B parameters) and 25.15 GB for Llama2-7B compared to AdamW in full-precision training settings.

Encoder-only transformer models such as BERT offer a great performance-size tradeoff for retrieval and classification tasks with respect to larger decoder-only models. Despite being the workhorse of numerous production pipelines, there have been limited Pareto improvements to BERT since its release. In this paper, we introduce ModernBERT, bringing modern model optimizations to encoder-only models and representing a major Pareto improvement over older encoders. Trained on 2 trillion tokens with a native 8192 sequence length, ModernBERT models exhibit state-of-the-art results on a large pool of evaluations encompassing diverse classification tasks and both single and multi-vector retrieval on different domains (including code). In addition to strong downstream performance, ModernBERT is also the most speed and memory efficient encoder and is designed for inference on common GPUs.
