Text:"RewardDance: Reward Scaling in Visual Generation Jie Wu, Yu Gao Zilyu Ye Ming Li Liang Li Hanzhong Guo Jie Liu Zeyue Xue Xiaoxia Hou Wei Liu Yan Zeng Weilin HuangEqual contribution, Corresponding authors, Project leadReward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we introduce RewardDance, scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes these barriers through novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the reward score as the models probability of predicting "yes" token, indicating that the generated image outperforms reference image according to specific criteria RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image, text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models. 5 2 0 2 0 1 ] . [ 1 6 2 8 8 0 . 9 0 5 2 : r Figure 1 RewardDance consistently boosts T2I and T2V generation (validated by alignment/GSB). The reward variance during the later stages of RL training, represented by bubble size, serves as an indicator of policy "hacking." Low variance implies mode collapse, where the model tends to generate uniform, high-reward outputs. High variance signifies the policy maintains output diversity across various prompts, indicating that it has not collapsed.Diffusion models have achieved immense progress in visual generation. State-of-the-art models such as FLUX [26] and Seedream [14, 16] for image generation, alongside Wan2.1 [56] and Seedance [15] for video generation, have unlocked vast creative potential. These capabilities are further enhanced by paradigms like Reinforcement Learning (RL) [11, 13, 18, 20, 28, 29, 34, 55, 67] and Test-time Scaling [39], where the Reward Model (RM) plays pivotal role. While robust and accurate RM can significantly improve generation quality, the community has lacked clear guidance on designing superior RMs. In this paper, we introduce RewardDance, new framework built on the principle that scalability is the key to creating better visual RMs. Methods Task Aligning Stage Base Model Modeling Paradigm Model Scaling Context Scaling Task Instruction Reference Examples CoT Data ImageReward [64] PickScore [23] HPSv2 [63] VisionReward [65] VideoAlign [35] HPSv3 [40] WorldPM [57] Visual Visual Visual Visual Visual Visual Understanding DeepSeek-GRM [36] Understanding Understanding Multimodal Visual Pairwise RM [66] UnifiedReward [59] RewardDance RL RL RL RL RL RL&Infer RL Infer RL - RL&Infer CLIP CLIP CLIP VLM VLM VLM VLM VLM VLM VLM VLM Regressive Regressive Regressive Regressive Regressive Regressive Regressive Generative Generative Generative Generative Table 1 comprehensive comparison of visual and multimodal reward models. Our RewardDance is the first framework for visual generation to successfully integrate generative paradigm with comprehensive scalability across both reward model size and reward context dimensions (task instructions, reference examples, and CoT data). Our work is motivated by comprehensive analysis of existing reward modeling methods, as summarized in Table 1. Early CLIP-based reward models [63, 64] were limited by CLIPs architecture, which was difficult to scale [31] and generalized poorly to diverse tasks [30]. Later VLM-based models explored new paradigms and scaling strategies, but progress has been fragmented: some achieve large-scale models yet remain limited to regressive paradigms (e.g., HPSv3 [40] , WorldPM [57]), while others adopt stronger generative paradigms without effective scaling (e.g., UnifiedReward [59]). As shown in the Figure 2 , the regression-based reward model is very susceptible to reward hacking. Figure 2 Comparison of training dynamics for Regressive vs. Generative reward models during diffusion RL fine-tuning. At the same 2B model scale (Left vs. Middle panel), the generative reward model exhibits significantly superior training dynamics compared to the regression-based one: it facilitates higher exploration magnitude, manifested as greater reward variance, and more favorable reward growth trend. This higher diversity in reward signals indicates that the generative RM exhibits stronger robustness against reward hacking. Under regression-based RM, the diffusion model risks learning to exploit reward loopholes to achieve high scores without making substantive progress. This inherent robustness is key to the generative RMs successful scaling to 26B parameters (Right panel). We introduce RewardDance to address above challenges. It represents the first framework designed to achieve this unification, leveraging generative paradigm that enables effective scaling across both model size and 2 contextincluding task-specific instructions, reference examples, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoningto unlock the full potential of VLMs for advanced visual reward modeling. Our RewardDance framework resolves this fundamental paradigm mismatch by rethinking reward modeling as generative task. Instead of appending regression head, we convert the reward score into the VLMs predicted probability of "yes" token. This approach natively aligns the reward objective with the VLMs autoregressive, next-token prediction mechanism, thereby enabling effective reward scaling along two primary dimensions: Model Scaling: We bre"

"Reinforcement Learning enhances Large Language Models for complex reasoning tasks, facing challenges in scalability and infrastructure as the field advances.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for broader reasoning models. Github: https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/Awesome-RL-for-LRMs"
