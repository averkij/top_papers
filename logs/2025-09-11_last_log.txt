Text:"2025-09-10 Hunyuan-MT Technical ReportIn this report, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-7B, our first open-source multilingual translation model, which supports bidirectional translation across 33 major languages and places special emphasis on translation between Mandarin and several ethnic minority languages as well as dialects. Furthermore, to serve and address diverse translation scenarios and enhance model performance at test time, we introduce Hunyuan-MTChimera-7B, translation model inspired by the slow thinking mode. This model integrates multiple outputs generated by the Hunyuan-MT-7B model under varying parameter settings, thereby achieving performance superior to that of conventional slow-thinking models based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The development of our models follows holistic training process specifically engineered for multilingual translation, which begins with general and MT-oriented pre-training to build foundational capabilities, proceeds to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task-specific adaptation, and culminates in advanced alignment through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and weak-to-strong RL. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that both Hunyuan-MT-7B and Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B significantly outperform all translation-specific models of comparable parameter size and most of the SOTA large models, particularly on the task of translation between Mandarin and minority languages as well as dialects. In the WMT2025 shared task (General Machine Translation), our models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 30 out of 31 language pairs. This result highlights the robustness of our models across diverse linguistic spectrum, encompassing high-resource languages such as Chinese, English, and Japanese, as well as low-resource languages including Czech, Marathi, Estonian, and Icelandic.

[ 2 9 0 2 5 0 . 9 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Benchmark performance of Hunyuan-MT models and state-of-the-art baselines.Machine Translation (MT) has emerged as both critically important practical application and one of the most formidable research challenges that the computational linguistics community has pursued over the past several decades (Brown et al., 1990; 1993; Papineni et al., 2002; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016; Vaswani et al., 2017). The recent advent and rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the learning paradigm underlying MT systems, catalyzing shift from traditional rule-based and statistical approaches toward sophisticated large-scale neural learning methodologies (Zhu et al., 2024; Kocmi et al., 2024; Pang et al., 2025). This continuous technological evolution of LLMs has dramatically pushed the boundaries of achievable translation quality to unprecedented levels, with state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4.1 (OpenAI, 2025), Gemini-2.5-Pro (DeepMind, 2025), and Claude-Sonnet-4 (Anthropic, 2025), demonstrating remarkable capabilities that exceed the performance of expert human translators across specific language pairs. Nevertheless, significant challenges persist (Pang et al., 2025), particularly in translating non-literal language, such as internet neologisms, slang, and specialized terminology, as well as place names. Furthermore, prevailing bias within MT research favors high-resource language pairs, leaving translation for low-resource and minority languages critically under-resourced. The translation between Chinas minority languages and Mandarin constitutes particularly acute manifestation of this neglect. Beyond its technical dimensions, facilitating high-quality translation in this context is pivotal for promoting social inclusion, preserving cultural heritage, and ensuring equitable access to essential services and information for minority communities (Hu et al., 2019; Lin & Jackson, 2021). Despite this pressing societal imperative, this specific domain represents significant lacuna within the MT field. Addressing these issues requires more than robust linguistic comprehension; it necessitates the ability to generate expressions that are both culturally resonant and idiomatically natural, thereby transcending literal word-for-word translation. Meanwhile, notable performance disparity remains between proprietary and open-source models, gap often attributed to the comparatively limited scale of open-source systems. This problem is compounded by scarcity of well-defined methodologies for developing advanced LLM-based MT systems, which impedes the broader communitys efforts to deploy and refine effective solutions (Jiao et al., 2023; Pang et al., 2025; Kocmi et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2025). Through extensive evaluations on representative MT benchmarks, Hunyuan-MT demonstrates superior performance, outperforming not only translation-specialized models of comparable size and prominent closed-source systems, such as Google-Translator, but also range of larger LLMs, as detailed in Figure 1. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that our model demonstrates significant superiority over all state-of-the-art LLMs on the task of translation between Chinas ethnic minority languages and Mandarin Chinese (MinorityMandarin Translation). In this technical report, we introduce Hunyuan-MT, the culmination of our ongoing efforts to develop more effective LLM-based multilingual translation models. Below, we show the main contributions of this technical report: 1. Hunyuan-MT-7B. We present Hunyuan-MT-7B, novel, open-source multilingual translation model with 7B parameters, which facilitates bidirectional translation among diverse set of 33 languages. Through extensive benchmarking, our model demonstrates SOTA performance against existing models in the approximate parameter size. Furthermore, key feature of Hunyuan-MT-7B is its robust support for low-resource language pairs, specifically enabling translation between Mandarin and several ethnic minority languages as well as dialects. 2. Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B. We propose new paradigm for high-quality machine translation, embodied in our model, Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B. As the first open-source weak-to-strong fusion model of its kind, it is architected for slow thinking translation tasks where quality is paramount. Unlike traditional methods that rely on"

Index TermsWorld Models; Video Generation; 3D Generation; 4D Generation; 3D Scene Understanding; Spatial IntelligenceWorld modeling has emerged as fundamental task in AI and robotics, aiming towards the ability to understand, represent, and anticipate the dynamic environments they inhabit [1], [2], [3]. Recent advancements in generative modeling techniques, including VAEs, GANs, diffusion models, and autoregressive models, have significantly enriched the field by enabling sophisticated generation and prediction capabilities [4], [5]. Much of this progress, however, has been centered on 2D data, primarily images or videos [6], [7], [8]. Realworld scenarios, in contrast, are inherently in 3D space and dynamic, often requiring models that leverage native 3D and 4D representations. These include RGB-D imagery [9], [10], [11], occupancy grids [12], [13], [14], and LiDAR point clouds [15], [16], [17], as well as their sequential forms that capture temporal dynamics [18], [19]. These modalities offer explicit geometry and physical grounding, which are indispensable for embodied and safety-critical systems such as autonomous driving and robotics [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Beyond these native formats, world modeling has also been explored in adjacent domains [27], [28], [29]. Some works address video, panoramic, or mesh-based data, with systems of this kind providing large-scale, general-purpose L. Kong, A. Liang, D. Lu, L. Li, and W. T.

In parallel, another line of research focuses on 3D object generation for asset creation, which specializes in controllable and highfidelity object synthesis [32], [33], [34]. Meanwhile, industrial projects from leading companies have launched ambitious world modeling initiatives that target practical applications ranging from interactive robotics and immersive simulation to large-scale digital twins [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], underscoring the growing importance of this field in both academia and industry. Despite this momentum, the term world model itself remains ambiguous, with inconsistent usage across the literature [27], [41], [42]. Some works narrowly interpret it as generative models for sensory data (e.g., images and videos), while others broaden the scope to include predictive forecasting, simulators, and decision-making frameworks [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]. Moreover, existing surveys largely emphasize 2D or vision-only modalities [6], [48], leaving the unique challenges and opportunities of native 3D and 4D data underexplored. This has led to fragmented body of literature lacking unified framework or taxonomy. Why native 3D and 4D matters? Unlike 2D projections, native 3D/4D signals encode metric geometry, visibility, and motion in the coordinates where physics acts [18], [49]. This makes them first-class carriers of constraints needed for actionable modeling: multi-view and egocentric consistency, rigid-body and non-rigid kinematics, scenescale occlusion reasoning, and map/topology adherence. In safety-critical settings, agents must not only produce photorealistic frames but also obey geometry, causality, and controllability; RGB-D, occupancy, and LiDAR provide the inductive bias to satisfy these requirements.

AgentGym-RL is a modular RL framework for training LLM agents in diverse environments without supervised fine-tuning, featuring ScalingInter-RL for balanced exploration-exploitation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch -- without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on 27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets -- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of intelligent agents.

Hunyuan-MT-7B and Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B are multilingual translation models that outperform existing models, especially in translating between Mandarin and minority languages, through a combination of pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this report, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-7B, our first open-source multilingual translation model, which supports bidirectional translation across 33 major languages and places a special emphasis on translation between Mandarin and several ethnic minority languages as well as dialects. Furthermore, to serve and address diverse translation scenarios and enhance model performance at test time, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B, a translation model inspired by the slow thinking mode. This model integrates multiple outputs generated by the Hunyuan-MT-7B model under varying parameter settings, thereby achieving performance superior to that of conventional slow-thinking models based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The development of our models follows a holistic training process specifically engineered for multilingual translation, which begins with general and MT-oriented pre-training to build foundational capabilities, proceeds to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task-specific adaptation, and culminates in advanced alignment through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and weak-to-strong RL. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that both Hunyuan-MT-7B and Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B significantly outperform all translation-specific models of comparable parameter size and most of the SOTA large models, particularly on the task of translation between Mandarin and minority languages as well as dialects. In the WMT2025 shared task (General Machine Translation), our models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 30 out of 31 language pairs. This result highlights the robustness of our models across a diverse linguistic spectrum, encompassing high-resource languages such as Chinese, English, and Japanese, as well as low-resource languages including Czech, Marathi, Estonian, and Icelandic.

P3-SAM, a native 3D point-promptable part segmentation model, achieves precise and robust segmentation of complex 3D objects using a feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor.  					AI-generated summary 				 Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part segmentation model termed P3-SAM, designed to fully automate the segmentation of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly 3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released soon.

"P3-SAM, a native 3D point-promptable part segmentation model, achieves precise and robust segmentation of complex 3D objects using a feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor.  					AI-generated summary 				 Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part segmentation model termed P3-SAM, designed to fully automate the segmentation of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly 3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released soon."

EnvX leverages Agentic AI to transform GitHub repositories into intelligent agents capable of natural language interaction and collaboration, automating the entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository functionality.  					AI-generated summary 				 The widespread availability of open-source repositories has led to a vast collection of reusable software components, yet their utilization remains manual, error-prone, and disconnected. Developers must navigate documentation, understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18 repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition, document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent, interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within the open-source ecosystem.

This survey provides a comprehensive review of 3D and 4D world modeling and generation, establishing definitions, taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation metrics, and discussing applications and challenges.  					AI-generated summary 				 World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data, they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions, introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen), occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges, and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and foundational reference for advancing the field.

A benchmark evaluates human agency in AI assistants using large language models, finding varying support across systems and dimensions.  					AI-generated summary 				 As humans delegate more tasks and decisions to artificial intelligence (AI), we risk losing control of our individual and collective futures. Relatively simple algorithmic systems already steer human decision-making, such as social media feed algorithms that lead people to unintentionally and absent-mindedly scroll through engagement-optimized content. In this paper, we develop the idea of human agency by integrating philosophical and scientific theories of agency with AI-assisted evaluation methods: using large language models (LLMs) to simulate and validate user queries and to evaluate AI responses. We develop HumanAgencyBench (HAB), a scalable and adaptive benchmark with six dimensions of human agency based on typical AI use cases. HAB measures the tendency of an AI assistant or agent to Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation, Correct Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and Maintain Social Boundaries. We find low-to-moderate agency support in contemporary LLM-based assistants and substantial variation across system developers and dimensions. For example, while Anthropic LLMs most support human agency overall, they are the least supportive LLMs in terms of Avoid Value Manipulation. Agency support does not appear to consistently result from increasing LLM capabilities or instruction-following behavior (e.g., RLHF), and we encourage a shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets.
