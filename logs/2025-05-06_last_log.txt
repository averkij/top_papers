Optimization methods such as parallelism, compression, and caching have been adopted to reduce costs, but the diverse service requirements make it hard to select the right method. Recently, specialized LLM inference engines have emerged as key component for integrating the optimization methods into service-oriented infrastructures. However, systematic study on inference engines is still lacking.This paper provides comprehensive evaluation of 25 open-source and commercial inference engines.

Text:"Grokking in the Wild: Data Augmentation for Real-World Multi-Hop Reasoning with Transformers Roman Abramov 1 Felix Steinbauer 1 Gjergji Kasneci5 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 1 2 5 7 0 2 . 4 0 5 2 : r Transformers have achieved great success in numerous NLP tasks but continue to exhibit notable gaps in multi-step factual reasoning, especially when real-world knowledge is sparse. Recent advances in grokking have demonstrated that neural networks can transition from memorizing to perfectly generalizing once they detect underlying logical patterns yet these studies have primarily used small, synthetic tasks. In this paper, for the first time, we extend grokking to real-world factual data and address the challenge of dataset sparsity by augmenting existing knowledge graphs with carefully designed synthetic data to raise the ratio ϕr of inferred facts to atomic facts above the threshold required for grokking. Surprisingly, we find that even factually incorrect synthetic data can strengthen emergent reasoning circuits rather than degrade accuracy, as it forces the model to rely on relational structure rather than memorization. When evaluated on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to 95 100% accuracy on 2WikiMultiHopQA substantially improving over strong baselines and matching or exceeding current state-of-the-art results. We further provide an in-depth analysis of how increasing ϕr drives the formation of generalizing circuits inside Transformers. Our findings suggest that grokking-based data augmentation can unlock implicit multi-hop reasoning capabilities, opening the door to more robust and interpretable factual reasoning in large-scale language models. 1School of Computation, Information and Technology, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany 2School of Social Sciences and Technology, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany. Correspondence to: Roman Abramov <roman.abramov@tum.de>, Felix Steinbauer <felix.steinbauer@tum.de>. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). 1 Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification, summarization, and machine translation. Nevertheless, they still face significant challenges when asked to perform multi-step or multi-hop factual reasoning, particularly in real-world scenarios where knowledge is both vast and sparsely distributed. key reason for this difficulty lies in the models tendency to memorize rather than generalize problem that becomes acute in knowledge-intensive tasks with insufficiently rich data distributions. Figure 1. Average accuracy on 2WikiMultiHopQA for comparison task. Despite GPT2-small being model with 124 million parameters, grokked version achieves almost 100% accuracy, beating the most recent gpt-4o and o1-mini models. From Toy Grokking to Real-World Data. Recent work on grokking (Power et al., 2022) has shown that, under certain conditions, overparameterized neural networks suddenly transition from pure memorization to near-perfect generalization after long training. Early studies have typically focused on highly controlled, synthetic tasks such as modular arithmetic or simplified algorithmic datasets. In these toy settings, the number of inferred facts (i.e., multistep or composed patterns) can be systematically increased until threshold ratio ϕ is reached, at which point generalizing circuit emerges in the model (Belkin et al., 2019; Nakkiran et al., 2020; Thilak et al., 2022; Humayun et al., 2023; Nanda et al., 2023). However, real-world datasets present stark contrast: facGrokking in the Wild: Data Augmentation for Real-World Multi-Hop Reasoning with Transformers tual knowledge is extremely sparse and often scattered across incomplete or noisy knowledge graphs. Thus, the core challenge is to ensure that there are enough higherorder inferred facts in relation to the atomic facts (direct statements) to enable the internal circuit-formation process that grokking requires. Put differently, in real-world scenarios, one cannot trivially guarantee sufficiently large ratio ϕ between multi-step (inferred) facts and single-hop (atomic) facts. Our work addresses precisely this obstacle by proposing data-synthesis strategy that augments and re-balances real-world knowledge bases. Multi-hop Question Answering (QA). 2WikiMultiHopQA (Yang et al., 2018; Ho et al., 2020; Trivedi et al., 2022) is particularly well-suited to assess multi-step factual reasoning. This dataset contains Wikipedia-based queries that require retrieving and combining multiple pieces of evidence (spread across different pages or paragraphs) before producing an answer. This property aligns closely with our focus on multi-hop reasoning and underscores the need for implicit reasoning capability: in many cases, system must link and traverse several factual nodes e.g., Michelle is the wife of Obama and Michelle was born in 1964 to arrive at final conclusion (e.g., about Michelles birth year or other derived facts). Moreover, they reflect large, complex knowledge graph with real-world entities, ambiguous language, and long-tail relations all of which make them an archetypal testbed for factual reasoning at scale. Grokking and Its Role in Transformer Generalization. The concept of grokking, introduced in Power et al. (2022), demonstrated that neural networks could learn not just superficial patterns but also deeper, generalizable reasoning mechanisms under prolonged training with suitable inductive biases. Subsequent work has linked grokking to double descent (Belkin et al., 2019; Nakkiran et al., 2020), the geometry of deep-network loss landscapes (Davies et al., 2023), and weight decay (Pezeshki et al., 2022; Nanda et al., 2023), suggesting that the right regularization can encourage the emergence of generalizing circuits. These circuits once formed enable out-of-distribution reasoning that surpasses naive memorization (Varma et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). Gap in the Literature. Despite extensive research on knowledge graph completion (Liu et al., 2022) and multihop question answering via retrieval-based methods (Yang et al., 2018; Ho et al., 2020), very few studies have examined whether the internal grokking phenomenon can be harnessed for implicit multi-hop reasoning in real-world textual setting. Most prior approaches either: Focus on toy tasks: e.g., modular addition or synthetic math problems (Power et al., 2022; Nanda et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024). Rely o"

A voice AI agent that blends seamlessly into daily life would interact with humans in an autonomous, real-time, and emotionally expressive manner. Rather than merely reacting to commands, it would continuously listen, reason, and respond proactively, fostering fluid, dynamic, and emotionally resonant interactions. We introduce Voila, a family of large voice-language foundation models that make a step towards this vision. Voila moves beyond traditional pipeline systems by adopting a new end-to-end architecture that enables full-duplex, low-latency conversations while preserving rich vocal nuances such as tone, rhythm, and emotion. It achieves a response latency of just 195 milliseconds, surpassing the average human response time. Its hierarchical multi-scale Transformer integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with powerful acoustic modeling, enabling natural, persona-aware voice generation -- where users can simply write text instructions to define the speaker's identity, tone, and other characteristics. Moreover, Voila supports over one million pre-built voices and efficient customization of new ones from brief audio samples as short as 10 seconds. Beyond spoken dialogue, Voila is designed as a unified model for a wide range of voice-based applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and, with minimal adaptation, multilingual speech translation. Voila is fully open-sourced to support open research and accelerate progress toward next-generation human-machine interactions.

We address a fundamental challenge in Reinforcement Learning from Interaction Demonstration (RLID): demonstration noise and coverage limitations. While existing data collection approaches provide valuable interaction demonstrations, they often yield sparse, disconnected, and noisy trajectories that fail to capture the full spectrum of possible skill variations and transitions. Our key insight is that despite noisy and sparse demonstrations, there exist infinite physically feasible trajectories that naturally bridge between demonstrated skills or emerge from their neighboring states, forming a continuous space of possible skill variations and transitions. Building upon this insight, we present two data augmentation techniques: a Stitched Trajectory Graph (STG) that discovers potential transitions between demonstration skills, and a State Transition Field (STF) that establishes unique connections for arbitrary states within the demonstration neighborhood. To enable effective RLID with augmented data, we develop an Adaptive Trajectory Sampling (ATS) strategy for dynamic curriculum generation and a historical encoding mechanism for memory-dependent skill learning. Our approach enables robust skill acquisition that significantly generalizes beyond the reference demonstrations. Extensive experiments across diverse interaction tasks demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence stability, generalization capability, and recovery robustness.

Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in chatbots, code generators, and search engines. Workloads such as chain-of-thought, complex reasoning, and agent services significantly increase the inference cost by invoking the model repeatedly. Optimization methods such as parallelism, compression, and caching have been adopted to reduce costs, but the diverse service requirements make it hard to select the right method. Recently, specialized LLM inference engines have emerged as a key component for integrating the optimization methods into service-oriented infrastructures. However, a systematic study on inference engines is still lacking. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of 25 open-source and commercial inference engines. We examine each inference engine in terms of ease-of-use, ease-of-deployment, general-purpose support, scalability, and suitability for throughput- and latency-aware computation. Furthermore, we explore the design goals of each inference engine by investigating the optimization techniques it supports. In addition, we assess the ecosystem maturity of open source inference engines and handle the performance and cost policy of commercial solutions. We outline future research directions that include support for complex LLM-based services, support of various hardware, and enhanced security, offering practical guidance to researchers and developers in selecting and designing optimized LLM inference engines. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field: https://github.com/sihyeong/Awesome-LLM-Inference-Engine

"Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in chatbots, code generators, and search engines. Workloads such as chain-of-thought, complex reasoning, and agent services significantly increase the inference cost by invoking the model repeatedly. Optimization methods such as parallelism, compression, and caching have been adopted to reduce costs, but the diverse service requirements make it hard to select the right method. Recently, specialized LLM inference engines have emerged as a key component for integrating the optimization methods into service-oriented infrastructures. However, a systematic study on inference engines is still lacking. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of 25 open-source and commercial inference engines. We examine each inference engine in terms of ease-of-use, ease-of-deployment, general-purpose support, scalability, and suitability for throughput- and latency-aware computation. Furthermore, we explore the design goals of each inference engine by investigating the optimization techniques it supports. In addition, we assess the ecosystem maturity of open source inference engines and handle the performance and cost policy of commercial solutions. We outline future research directions that include support for complex LLM-based services, support of various hardware, and enhanced security, offering practical guidance to researchers and developers in selecting and designing optimized LLM inference engines.

Transformers have achieved great success in numerous NLP tasks but continue to exhibit notable gaps in multi-step factual reasoning, especially when real-world knowledge is sparse. Recent advances in grokking have demonstrated that neural networks can transition from memorizing to perfectly generalizing once they detect underlying logical patterns - yet these studies have primarily used small, synthetic tasks. In this paper, for the first time, we extend grokking to real-world factual data and address the challenge of dataset sparsity by augmenting existing knowledge graphs with carefully designed synthetic data to raise the ratio phi_r of inferred facts to atomic facts above the threshold required for grokking. Surprisingly, we find that even factually incorrect synthetic data can strengthen emergent reasoning circuits rather than degrade accuracy, as it forces the model to rely on relational structure rather than memorization. When evaluated on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to 95-100% accuracy on 2WikiMultiHopQA - substantially improving over strong baselines and matching or exceeding current state-of-the-art results. We further provide an in-depth analysis of how increasing phi_r drives the formation of generalizing circuits inside Transformers. Our findings suggest that grokking-based data augmentation can unlock implicit multi-hop reasoning capabilities, opening the door to more robust and interpretable factual reasoning in large-scale language models.
