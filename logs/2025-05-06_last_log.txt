We evaluate our accuracy and scalability on existing large-scale NeRF datasets. Additionally, we also introduce new dataset with very large-scale scenes (> 6.5km2) from UrbanBIS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can be easily scaled to various large-scale scenes and achieve state-of-the-art scene rendering accuracy. Furthermore, our method exhibits significant efficiency gains, with an 8x acceleration in training and 16x acceleration in rendering compared to the best-performing competitor Switch-NeRF. The codes and trained models will be released in https://github.com/MiZhenxing/Switch-NeRF. Index TermsNeural Radiance Fields; Mixture of Experts; Large-scale 3D reconstruction; Novel view synthesisNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [1] have shown the powerfulness for high-fidelity 3D scene modeling. Recent methods [2], [3], [4] have scaled NeRF to large-scale scenes with thousands of high-resolution images. The scalability of them essentially comes from the decomposition of the 3D scenes. Several sub-NeRF-networks handle different partitions of large scene. Mega-NeRF [2] and Block-NeRF [3] both incorporate hand-crafted decomposition rules for different scenes. They decompose 3D scenes by clustering based on 3D physical distances or street blocks. Despite the promising performances achieved by current large-scale NeRF methods, several critical challenges remain unexplored. Firstly, design universal decomposition rule is extremely challenging for different large-scale scenes. The real-world large-scale scenes tend to have very different and complex scene structures. Hand-crafted rules will inevitably brings adaptation issues for distinct scenarios. Moreover, the non-learnable nature of hand-crafted decomposition restricts the networks ability to optimize the scene decomposition and radiance fields together within an end-to-end framework. To handle this problem, we need learnable decomposition method to automatically learn different decomposition for different scenes and we can optimize the Zhenxing Mi and Dan Xu are with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR.

E-mail: yinping@inspur.com, xiaoxue@inspur.com decomposition together with the scene representation. Secondly, large-scale scene is typically irregular and complex, with different scene parts exhibiting diverse appearance and geometry distributions, which requires heterogeneous modeling capabilities to produce high-quality scene representation. However, current large-scale NeRF methods often employ identical networks, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), for different parts of the scene, lacking explicit designs for heterogeneous modeling. Thirdly, the long training time and high GPU memory usage of existing methods is severe bottleneck that limits their scalability when dealing with much larger scenes. Although several methods such as Instant-NGP [5] have been proposed to enhance the NeRF representation and accelerate the NeRF training on smalland large-scale scenes [6], [7], [8], [9], they still attempt to fit an entire scene into single global network, overlooking the crucial aspect of heterogeneous scene representation from distinct scene decompositions. Consequently, these methods suffer from clear limitations in scalability and representation effectiveness, particularly when dealing with very large scenes. In this paper, to simultaneously tackle these critical challenges, we propose novel and highly scalable Heterogeneous Mixture of Hash Experts framework for NeRF, coined as Switch-NeRF++. The fundamental designs of SwitchNeRF++ are fourfold. 1) An end-to-end framework to learn scene decomposition in trainable manner, together with the scene representation. 2) An efficient hash-based gating network to learn scene decompositions. 3) heterogeneous JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 2 Fig. 1: The birds-eye view of scene in UrbanBIS [10], rendered using INGP [5] and our Switch-NeRF++, showcasing the impressive scalability of our approach.

Experiments on this scene demonstrate the superiority of our method in scaling to large-scale urban scenes with exceptional rendering quality. modeling of scene decomposition and each decomposed scene part. 4) highly scalable and efficient learning framework that can handle extremely large-scale scenes.

Recent NeRF methods on large-scale scenes have underlined the importance of scene decomposition for scalable NeRFs. Although achieving reasonable scalability, there are several critical problems remaining unexplored, i.e., learnable decomposition, modeling scene heterogeneity, and modeling efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Switch-NeRF++, a Heterogeneous Mixture of Hash Experts (HMoHE) network that addresses these challenges within a unified framework. It is a highly scalable NeRF that learns heterogeneous decomposition and heterogeneous NeRFs efficiently for large-scale scenes in an end-to-end manner. In our framework, a gating network learns to decomposes scenes and allocates 3D points to specialized NeRF experts. This gating network is co-optimized with the experts, by our proposed Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts (MoE) NeRF framework. We incorporate a hash-based gating network and distinct heterogeneous hash experts. The hash-based gating efficiently learns the decomposition of the large-scale scene. The distinct heterogeneous hash experts consist of hash grids of different resolution ranges, enabling effective learning of the heterogeneous representation of different scene parts. These design choices make our framework an end-to-end and highly scalable NeRF solution for real-world large-scale scene modeling to achieve both quality and efficiency. We evaluate our accuracy and scalability on existing large-scale NeRF datasets and a new dataset with very large-scale scenes (>6.5km^2) from UrbanBIS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can be easily scaled to various large-scale scenes and achieve state-of-the-art scene rendering accuracy. Furthermore, our method exhibits significant efficiency, with an 8x acceleration in training and a 16x acceleration in rendering compared to Switch-NeRF. Codes will be released in https://github.com/MiZhenxing/Switch-NeRF.
