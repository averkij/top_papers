We evaluate our accuracy and scalability on existing large-scale NeRF datasets. Additionally, we also introduce new dataset with very large-scale scenes (> 6.5km2) from UrbanBIS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can be easily scaled to various large-scale scenes and achieve state-of-the-art scene rendering accuracy. Furthermore, our method exhibits significant efficiency gains, with an 8x acceleration in training and 16x acceleration in rendering compared to the best-performing competitor Switch-NeRF. The codes and trained models will be released in https://github.com/MiZhenxing/Switch-NeRF. Index TermsNeural Radiance Fields; Mixture of Experts; Large-scale 3D reconstruction; Novel view synthesisNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [1] have shown the powerfulness for high-fidelity 3D scene modeling. Recent methods [2], [3], [4] have scaled NeRF to large-scale scenes with thousands of high-resolution images. The scalability of them essentially comes from the decomposition of the 3D scenes. Several sub-NeRF-networks handle different partitions of large scene. Mega-NeRF [2] and Block-NeRF [3] both incorporate hand-crafted decomposition rules for different scenes. They decompose 3D scenes by clustering based on 3D physical distances or street blocks. Despite the promising performances achieved by current large-scale NeRF methods, several critical challenges remain unexplored. Firstly, design universal decomposition rule is extremely challenging for different large-scale scenes. The real-world large-scale scenes tend to have very different and complex scene structures. Hand-crafted rules will inevitably brings adaptation issues for distinct scenarios. Moreover, the non-learnable nature of hand-crafted decomposition restricts the networks ability to optimize the scene decomposition and radiance fields together within an end-to-end framework. To handle this problem, we need learnable decomposition method to automatically learn different decomposition for different scenes and we can optimize the Zhenxing Mi and Dan Xu are with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR.

E-mail: yinping@inspur.com, xiaoxue@inspur.com decomposition together with the scene representation. Secondly, large-scale scene is typically irregular and complex, with different scene parts exhibiting diverse appearance and geometry distributions, which requires heterogeneous modeling capabilities to produce high-quality scene representation. However, current large-scale NeRF methods often employ identical networks, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), for different parts of the scene, lacking explicit designs for heterogeneous modeling. Thirdly, the long training time and high GPU memory usage of existing methods is severe bottleneck that limits their scalability when dealing with much larger scenes. Although several methods such as Instant-NGP [5] have been proposed to enhance the NeRF representation and accelerate the NeRF training on smalland large-scale scenes [6], [7], [8], [9], they still attempt to fit an entire scene into single global network, overlooking the crucial aspect of heterogeneous scene representation from distinct scene decompositions. Consequently, these methods suffer from clear limitations in scalability and representation effectiveness, particularly when dealing with very large scenes. In this paper, to simultaneously tackle these critical challenges, we propose novel and highly scalable Heterogeneous Mixture of Hash Experts framework for NeRF, coined as Switch-NeRF++. The fundamental designs of SwitchNeRF++ are fourfold. 1) An end-to-end framework to learn scene decomposition in trainable manner, together with the scene representation. 2) An efficient hash-based gating network to learn scene decompositions. 3) heterogeneous JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 2 Fig. 1: The birds-eye view of scene in UrbanBIS [10], rendered using INGP [5] and our Switch-NeRF++, showcasing the impressive scalability of our approach.

Experiments on this scene demonstrate the superiority of our method in scaling to large-scale urban scenes with exceptional rendering quality. modeling of scene decomposition and each decomposed scene part. 4) highly scalable and efficient learning framework that can handle extremely large-scale scenes.

[06.05.2025 13:26] Abstract 12. Due to the challenges of manually collecting accurate editing data, existing datasets are typically constructed using various automated methods, leading to noisy supervision signals caused by the mismatch between editing instructions and original-edited image pairs. Recent efforts attempt to improve...

[06.05.2025 13:26] Abstract 13. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various domains. However, the substantial hardware resources required for their training present a significant barrier to efficiency and scalability. To mitigate this challenge, low-precision training techniques have been widel...

[06.05.2025 13:26] Abstract 14. We introduce Ming-Lite-Uni, an open-source multimodal framework featuring a newly designed unified visual generator and a native multimodal autoregressive model tailored for unifying vision and language. Specifically, this project provides an open-source implementation of the integrated MetaQueries ...

[06.05.2025 13:26] Abstract 15. Real-time, intelligent, and natural speech interaction is an essential part of the next-generation human-computer interaction. Recent advancements have showcased the potential of building intelligent spoken chatbots based on large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce LLaMA-Omni 2, a s...

[06.05.2025 13:26] Abstract 16. Understanding causal event relationships and achieving fine-grained temporal grounding in videos remain challenging for vision-language models. Existing methods either compress video tokens to reduce temporal resolution, or treat videos as unsegmented streams, which obscures fine-grained event bound...

[06.05.2025 13:26] Abstract 17. Current multi-subject customization approaches encounter two critical challenges: the difficulty in acquiring diverse multi-subject training data, and attribute entanglement across different subjects. To bridge these gaps, we propose MUSAR - a simple yet effective framework to achieve robust multi-s...

[06.05.2025 13:26] Abstract 18. Recent NeRF methods on large-scale scenes have underlined the importance of scene decomposition for scalable NeRFs. Although achieving reasonable scalability, there are several critical problems remaining unexplored, i.e., learnable decomposition, modeling scene heterogeneity, and modeling efficienc...

[06.05.2025 13:26] Abstract 19. LLMs trained on massive datasets may inadvertently acquire sensitive information such as personal details and potentially harmful content. This risk is further heightened in multimodal LLMs as they integrate information from multiple modalities (image and text). Adversaries can exploit this knowledg...
