Image watermarking methods are not tailored to handle small watermarked areas. This restricts applications in real-world scenarios where parts of the image may come from different sources or have been edited. We introduce a deep-learning model for localized image watermarking, dubbed the Watermark Anything Model (WAM). The WAM embedder imperceptibly modifies the input image, while the extractor segments the received image into watermarked and non-watermarked areas and recovers one or several hidden messages from the areas found to be watermarked. The models are jointly trained at low resolution and without perceptual constraints, then post-trained for imperceptibility and multiple watermarks. Experiments show that WAM is competitive with state-of-the art methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness, especially against inpainting and splicing, even on high-resolution images. Moreover, it offers new capabilities: WAM can locate watermarked areas in spliced images and extract distinct 32-bit messages with less than 1 bit error from multiple small regions - no larger than 10% of the image surface - even for small 256times 256 images.

Safety fine-tuning algorithms are commonly used to fine-tune language models to reduce harmful outputs, but the exact internal mechanisms of how those models achieve this remain unclear. In studying direct preference optimisation (DPO) for toxicity reduction, current explanations claim that DPO works by dampening the most toxic MLP neurons to learn an offset to avert toxic regions in the residual stream. However, by ablating the most toxic neurons and applying activation patching, we find this explanation incomplete. By projecting neuron activation changes onto a toxicity probe, we find that only 31.8\% of toxicity reduction comes from dampened toxic neurons. Instead, DPO reduces toxicity by accumulating effects across multiple neuron groups, both reducing writing in the toxic direction and promoting anti-toxicity in the residual stream. Moreover, DPO gives noisy adjustments to neuron activations, with many neurons actually increasing toxicity. This indicates that DPO is a balancing process between opposing neuron effects to achieve toxicity reduction.

Human motion generation is a cut-edge area of research in generative computer vision, with promising applications in video creation, game development, and robotic manipulation. The recent Mamba architecture shows promising results in efficiently modeling long and complex sequences, yet two significant challenges remain: Firstly, directly applying Mamba to extended motion generation is ineffective, as the limited capacity of the implicit memory leads to memory decay. Secondly, Mamba struggles with multimodal fusion compared to Transformers, and lack alignment with textual queries, often confusing directions (left or right) or omitting parts of longer text queries. To address these challenges, our paper presents three key contributions: Firstly, we introduce KMM, a novel architecture featuring Key frame Masking Modeling, designed to enhance Mamba's focus on key actions in motion segments. This approach addresses the memory decay problem and represents a pioneering method in customizing strategic frame-level masking in SSMs. Additionally, we designed a contrastive learning paradigm for addressing the multimodal fusion problem in Mamba and improving the motion-text alignment. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on the go-to dataset, BABEL, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a reduction of more than 57% in FID and 70% parameters compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

"Human motion generation is a cut-edge area of research in generative computer vision, with promising applications in video creation, game development, and robotic manipulation. The recent Mamba architecture shows promising results in efficiently modeling long and complex sequences, yet two significant challenges remain: Firstly, directly applying Mamba to extended motion generation is ineffective, as the limited capacity of the implicit memory leads to memory decay. Secondly, Mamba struggles with multimodal fusion compared to Transformers, and lack alignment with textual queries, often confusing directions (left or right) or omitting parts of longer text queries. To address these challenges, our paper presents three key contributions: Firstly, we introduce KMM, a novel architecture featuring Key frame Masking Modeling, designed to enhance Mamba's focus on key actions in motion segments. This approach addresses the memory decay problem and represents a pioneering method in customizing strategic frame-level masking in SSMs. Additionally, we designed a contrastive learning paradigm for addressing the multimodal fusion problem in Mamba and improving the motion-text alignment. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on the go-to dataset, BABEL, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a reduction of more than 57% in FID and 70% parameters compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Adding Object into images based on text instructions is a challenging task in semantic image editing, requiring a balance between preserving the original scene and seamlessly integrating the new object in a fitting location. Despite extensive efforts, existing models often struggle with this balance, particularly with finding a natural location for adding an object in complex scenes. We introduce Add-it, a training-free approach that extends diffusion models' attention mechanisms to incorporate information from three key sources: the scene image, the text prompt, and the generated image itself. Our weighted extended-attention mechanism maintains structural consistency and fine details while ensuring natural object placement. Without task-specific fine-tuning, Add-it achieves state-of-the-art results on both real and generated image insertion benchmarks, including our newly constructed "Additing Affordance Benchmark" for evaluating object placement plausibility, outperforming supervised methods. Human evaluations show that Add-it is preferred in over 80% of cases, and it also demonstrates improvements in various automated metrics.
