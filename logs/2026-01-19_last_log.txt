Text:"What Matters in Data Curation for Multimodal Reasoning? Insights from the DCVLR Challenge Yosub Shin 1 Michael Buriek 1 2 Boris Sobolev 1 3 Pavel Bushuyeu 1 Vikas Kumar 1 Haoyang Xu 1 Samuel Watson 1 Igor Molybog 1 6 2 0 2 6 1 ] A . [ 1 2 2 9 0 1 . 1 0 6 2 : r Abstract We study data curation for multimodal reasoning through the NeurIPS 2025 Data Curation for VisionLanguage Reasoning (DCVLR) challenge (DCVLR Organizers, 2025), which isolates dataset selection by fixing the model and training protocol. Using compact curated dataset derived primarily from Walton Multimodal Cold Start, our submission placed first in the challenge. Through post-competition ablations, we show that difficulty-based example selection on an aligned base dataset is the dominant driver of performance gains. Increasing dataset size does not reliably improve mean accuracy under the fixed training recipe, but mainly reduces run-to-run variance, while commonly used diversity and synthetic augmentation heuristics provide no additional benefit and often degrade performance. These results characterize DCVLR as saturation-regime evaluation and highlight the central role of alignment and difficulty in data-efficient multimodal reasoning. 1. Introduction Visionlanguage models (VLMs) are increasingly expected to perform faithful, multi-step reasoning over combined visual and textual inputs. While recent progress has emphasized model scaling and training algorithms, growing body of work in reasoning fine-tuning shows that performance can be strongly influenced by which examples are used for supervision, even when model architecture and optimization remain fixed. In such settings, fine-tuning often operates in saturation regime: most gains arise from relatively small number of carefully selected examples, while additional data primarily stabilizes learned behaviors rather than introducing fundamentally new capabilities. 1University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI, USA 2PwC, USA 3Cisco, USA.

AgencyBench presents a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents across real-world scenarios, enabling automated evaluation through user simulation and sandbox environments while revealing performance gaps between closed-source and open-source models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) based autonomous agents demonstrate multifaceted capabilities to contribute substantially to economic production. However, existing benchmarks remain focused on single agentic capability, failing to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios. Moreover, the reliance on human-in-the-loop feedback for realistic tasks creates a scalability bottleneck, hindering automated rollout collection and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks. We believe this work sheds light on the future direction of autonomous agents, and we release the full benchmark and evaluation toolkit at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/AgencyBench.

Data curation for multimodal reasoning shows that difficulty-based example selection on aligned datasets drives performance gains, while increasing dataset size mainly reduces variance and synthetic augmentation heuristics often degrade performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 We study data curation for multimodal reasoning through the NeurIPS 2025 Data Curation for Vision-Language Reasoning (DCVLR) challenge, which isolates dataset selection by fixing the model and training protocol. Using a compact curated dataset derived primarily from Walton Multimodal Cold Start, our submission placed first in the challenge. Through post-competition ablations, we show that difficulty-based example selection on an aligned base dataset is the dominant driver of performance gains. Increasing dataset size does not reliably improve mean accuracy under the fixed training recipe, but mainly reduces run-to-run variance, while commonly used diversity and synthetic augmentation heuristics provide no additional benefit and often degrade performance. These results characterize DCVLR as a saturation-regime evaluation and highlight the central role of alignment and difficulty in data-efficient multimodal reasoning.
