Text:"PhyRPR: Training-Free Physics-Constrained Video Generation Yibo Zhao1 Hengjia Li1 Xiaofei He1 Boxi Wu1 1State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University 6 2 0 2 4 1 ] . [ 1 5 5 2 9 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r Fig. 1: Samples produced by our method. (ab) require physical priors, while (cd) emphasize strict motion constraints. Our three-stage pipeline PhyRPR (PhyReasonPhyPlanPhyRefine) decouples physical reasoning from rendering to better satisfy physical constraints while maintaining high-fidelity video quality. AbstractRecent diffusion-based video generation models can synthesize visually plausible videos, yet they often struggle to satisfy physical constraints. key reason is that most existing approaches remain single-stage: they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis, making it hard to generate content that require explicit physical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose training-free threestage pipeline, PhyRPR: PhyReasonPhyPlanPhyRefine, which decouples physical understanding from visual synthesis. Specifically, PhyReason uses large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and an image generator for keyframe synthesis; PhyPlan deterministically synthesizes controllable coarse motion scaffold; and PhyRefine injects this scaffold into diffusion sampling via latent fusion strategy to refine appearance while preserving the planned dynamics. This staged design enables explicit physical control during generation. Extensive experiments under physics constraints show that our method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability. Index TermsDiffusion Model, Reasoning video generation I. INTRODUCTION In recent years, diffusion-based video generation models have made remarkable progress, synthesizing high-fidelity and visually compelling, film-like content. However, despite their impressive visual realism, video diffusion models remain largely correlation-driven: they primarily exploit patterns in large-scale tra"

Vision-Language-Action models are enhanced by incorporating action-space reasoning through a structured sequence of coarse action intents, improving manipulation task performance in both simulation and real-world environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as essential generalist robot policies for diverse manipulation tasks, conventionally relying on directly translating multimodal inputs into actions via Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings. Recent advancements have introduced explicit intermediary reasoning, such as sub-task prediction (language) or goal image synthesis (vision), to guide action generation. However, these intermediate reasoning are often indirect and inherently limited in their capacity to convey the full, granular information required for precise action execution. Instead, we posit that the most effective form of reasoning is one that deliberates directly in the action space. We introduce Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a paradigm where the reasoning process itself is formulated as a structured sequence of coarse action intents that guide the final policy. In this paper, we propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture that materializes the ACoT paradigm. Specifically, we introduce two complementary components: an Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR). The former proposes coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, while the latter extracts latent action priors from internal representations of multimodal input, co-forming an ACoT that conditions the downstream action head to enable grounded policy learning. Extensive experiments in real-world and simulation environments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves 98.5%, 84.1%, and 47.4% on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus and VLABench, respectively.

A three-stage pipeline decouples physical reasoning from visual synthesis in video generation, improving physical plausibility and motion controllability through distinct phases of reasoning, planning, and refinement.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent diffusion-based video generation models can synthesize visually plausible videos, yet they often struggle to satisfy physical constraints. A key reason is that most existing approaches remain single-stage: they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis, making it hard to generate content that require explicit physical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free three-stage pipeline,PhyRPR:Phy\uline{Reason}--Phy\uline{Plan}--Phy\uline{Refine}, which decouples physical understanding from visual synthesis. Specifically, PhyReason uses a large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and an image generator for keyframe synthesis; PhyPlan deterministically synthesizes a controllable coarse motion scaffold; and PhyRefine injects this scaffold into diffusion sampling via a latent fusion strategy to refine appearance while preserving the planned dynamics. This staged design enables explicit physical control during generation. Extensive experiments under physics constraints show that our method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability.

Такой подход позволяет явно контролировать физические ограничения во время генерации видео, значительно повышая правдоподобность движений и улучшая управляемость динамики.",
