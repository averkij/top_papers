PMLR 267, 2025. Copyright 2025 by the author(s). Figure 1. Performance of different models on MedXpertQA Text and other benchmarks. Results on other benchmarks for Qwen2.5-72B, GPT-4o, and o1 are sourced from (Chen et al., 2024a; Nori et al., 2024). For these benchmarks, we report results for o1-preview in place of o1. plications in clinical scenarios (Achiam et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b; Saab et al., 2024). However, current text and multimodal benchmarks for evaluating general medical AI capabilities have numerous limitations: First, existing text medical benchmarks, such as PubMedQA (Jin et al., 2019), MedQA (Jin et al., 2021), MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022), and MMLU (Medical) (Wang et al., 2024b), lack comprehensive coverage of fine-grained and diverse real-world diagnostic scenarios, including highly specialized fields such as family and addiction medicine. This lack of essential breadth limits the applicability of medical AI in thoroughly addressing realistic medical scenarios. Moreover, these benchmarks fall short of sufficiently challenging current advanced AI, hindering progress toward reliable medical AI. For instance, o1-preview has achieved 96% and 99% accuracy on MedQA-USMLE and MMLU Medical Genetics, respectively (Nori et al., 2024). Second, traditional multimodal medical benchmarks (Lau et al., 2018; He et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b) are critically inconsistent with real-world clinical scenarios: 1) Limited Scope and Insufficient Difficulty. These benchmarks solely evaluate basic visual perception and medical knowledge, neglecting the complexity of real-world medical tasks MedXpertQA: Benchmarking Expert-Level Medical Reasoning and Understanding Figure 2. Overview of MedXpertQA . The left side illustrates MedXpertQA diverse data sources, image types, and question attributes. The right side compares typical examples from MedXpertQA MM and traditional benchmark (VQA-RAD). across different stages of the diagnosis process. They fail to assess the expert-level knowledge and reasoning ability required for diagnostic decision-making and treatment planning. 2) Lack of Authenticity and Clinical Relevance. Current benchmarks lack detailed clinical information and rely on automatically generated simple QA paired with isolated medical images, diverging considerably from realistic clinical scenarios. Medical exam questions used in existing text benchmarks present promising solution, and Med-Gemini (Saab et al., 2024) also demonstrate the significance of such evaluations. However, the field still lacks systematic and high-quality benchmark. To address these challenges, we present MedXpertQA , highly challenging and comprehensive medical multiplechoice benchmark. It encompasses MedXpertQA Text for text-only evaluations and MedXpertQA MM for multimodal assessments, making it suitable for wide range of AI models. Both subsets are currently the most challenging benchmarks in their respective fields. Figure 1 presents model performance comparisons of MedXpertQA Text and other benchmarks. MedXpertQA MM includes diverse image types to simulate the wide variety of visual information encountered in real-world diagnosis. Overall, MedXpertQA covers wide range of medical specialties and systems and includes challenging real-world clinical tasks, enabling comprehensive evaluation of expert-level medical abilities. Figure 2 shows an overview. We conduct rigorous and thorough benchmark construction process, including data collection, filtering, synthesis, and expert review. Specifically, we first curate large-scale question bank from professional exams and textbooks, ensuring difficulty and diversity. Sources include the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination of the United States (COMLEX-USA) for general medical evaluation, 17 American specialty board exams for specialized scenarios, and 3 medical image-rich sources, such as the NEJM Image Challenges. We subsequently perform extensive and multi-dimensional question-filtering. First, we conduct hierarchical filtering using an adaptive Brier score (Zhu et al., 2024) threshold based on thousands of human responses, calibrated to the difficulty ratings annotated by human experts. We then filter questions based on 14 sampling votes from 8 AI experts for each question. Additionally, we use probabilistic semantic similarity and exact matching pr"

Training of large language models (LLMs) is typically distributed across large number of accelerators to reduce training time. Since internal states and parameter gradients need to be exchanged at each and every single gradient step, all devices need to be co-located using low-latency high-bandwidth communication links to support the required high volume of exchanged bits. Recently, distributed algorithms like DiLoCo (Douillard et al., 2024a) have relaxed such co-location constraint: accelerators can be grouped into workers, where synchronizations between workers only occur infrequently. This in turn means that workers can afford being connected by lower bandwidth communication links without affecting learning quality. However, in these methods, communication across workers still requires the same peak bandwidth as before, as the synchronizations require all parameters to be exchanged across all workers. In this paper, we improve DiLoCo in three ways. First, we synchronize only subsets of parameters in sequence, rather than all at once, which greatly reduces peak bandwidth. Second, we allow workers to continue training while synchronizing, which decreases wall clock time. Third, we quantize the data exchanged by workers, which further reduces bandwidth across workers. By properly combining these modifications, we show experimentally that we can distribute training of billion-scale parameters and reach similar quality as before, but reducing required bandwidth by two orders of magnitude.

Training of large language models (LLMs) is typically distributed across a large number of accelerators to reduce training time. Since internal states and parameter gradients need to be exchanged at each and every single gradient step, all devices need to be co-located using low-latency high-bandwidth communication links to support the required high volume of exchanged bits. Recently, distributed algorithms like DiLoCo have relaxed such co-location constraint: accelerators can be grouped into ``workers'', where synchronizations between workers only occur infrequently. This in turn means that workers can afford being connected by lower bandwidth communication links without affecting learning quality. However, in these methods, communication across workers still requires the same peak bandwidth as before, as the synchronizations require all parameters to be exchanged across all workers. In this paper, we improve DiLoCo in three ways. First, we synchronize only subsets of parameters in sequence, rather than all at once, which greatly reduces peak bandwidth. Second, we allow workers to continue training while synchronizing, which decreases wall clock time. Third, we quantize the data exchanged by workers, which further reduces bandwidth across workers. By properly combining these modifications, we show experimentally that we can distribute training of billion-scale parameters and reach similar quality as before, but reducing required bandwidth by two orders of magnitude.

Language model (LLM) post-training, from DPO to distillation, can refine behaviors and unlock new skills, but the open science supporting these post-training techniques is still in its infancy. One limiting factor has been the difficulty of conducting large-scale comparative analyses of synthetic data generating models and LLM judges. To close this gap, we introduce WILDCHAT-50M, the largest public chat dataset to date. We extend the existing WildChat dataset to include responses not only from GPT, but from over 50 different open-weight models, ranging in size from 0.5B to 104B parameters. We conduct an extensive comparative analysis and demonstrate the potential of this dataset by creating RE-WILD, our own public SFT mix, which outperforms the recent Tulu-3 SFT mixture from Allen AI with only 40% as many samples. Our dataset, samples and code are available at https://github.com/penfever/wildchat-50m.
