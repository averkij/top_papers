Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) (Achiam et al., 2023; Reid et al., 2024; Team, 2024a; Jiang et al., 2024; Dubey et al., 2024; Hui et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a) are revolutionizing numerous domains, including chatbots (OpenAI, 2022), search engines (OpenAI, 2024), and software engineering (CognitionAI, 2024). As these AI-powered tools become more deeply integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to ensure their safety and reliability. However, recent attacks (Guo et al., 2024; Formento et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024c) show their susceptibility to malicious manipulation. To alleviate this issue, companies have developed guard models, e.g., OpenAI Moderation (Markov et al., 2023), 1National University of Singapore 2University of Chines"

As LLMs increasingly impact safety-critical applications, ensuring their safety using guardrails remains a key challenge. This paper proposes GuardReasoner, a new safeguard for LLMs, by guiding the guard model to learn to reason. Concretely, we first create the GuardReasonerTrain dataset, which consists of 127K samples with 460K detailed reasoning steps. Then, we introduce reasoning SFT to unlock the reasoning capability of guard models. In addition, we present hard sample DPO to further strengthen their reasoning ability.

Remarkably, GuardReasoner 8B surpasses GPT-4o+CoT by 5.74% and LLaMA Guard 3 8B by 20.84% F1 score on average.
