[ 1 3 9 8 6 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r INVESTIGATING SAFETY VULNERABILITIES OF LARGE AUDIO-LANGUAGE MODELS UNDER SPEAKER EMOTIONAL VARIATIONS Bo-Han Feng1, Chien-Feng Liu1, Yu-Hsuan Li Liang1, Chih-Kai Yang1, Szu-Wei Fu2, Zhehuai Chen2, Ke-Han Lu1, Sung-Feng Huang2, Chao-Han Huck Yang2, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang2, Yun-Nung Chen1, Hung-yi Lee1 1National Taiwan University 2NVIDIA ABSTRACT Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend text-based LLMs with auditory understanding, offering new opportunities for multimodal applications. While their perception, reasoning, and task performance have been widely studied, their safety alignment under paralinguistic variation remains underexplored. This work systematically investigates the role of speaker emotion. We construct dataset of malicious speech instructions expressed across multiple emotions and intensities, and evaluate several state-of-theart LALMs. Our results reveal substantial safety inconsistencies: different emotions elicit varying levels of unsafe responses, and the effect of intensity is non-monotonic, with medium expressions often posing the greatest risk. These findings highlight an overlooked vulnerability in LALMs and call for alignment strategies explicitly designed to ensure robustness under emotional variation, prerequisite for trustworthy deployment in real-world settings. Index Terms Large audio-language models, safety, alignment 1. INTRODUCTION Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) [1, 2] have revolutionized AI research, extending their impact to speech processing [3, 4]. In particular, large audio-language models (LALMs) [5 16] augment text-based LLMs with auditory understanding, opening new possibilities for multimodal models and speech technologies. Although LALMs auditory perception [17], downstream performance [1821], reasoning ability [2224], and biases [25] have been extensively studied, research on their safety alignment has only just begun [2629]. Safety alignment, which aims to prev"

SAKE is a benchmark for editing auditory attribute knowledge in Large Audio-Language Models, addressing challenges in reliability, generality, locality, and portability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Knowledge editing offers an efficient way to update model knowledge without full retraining, but prior work has concentrated almost exclusively on textual or visual modalities. We introduce SAKE, the first benchmark specifically designed for editing auditory attribute knowledge in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs). Unlike factual updates, SAKE targets several abstract auditory attributes, capturing knowledge types that go beyond conventional textual and visual domains. We benchmark seven editing methods on two LALMs along four dimensions: reliability, generality, audio/text locality, and portability. Results highlight challenges such as preserving intra-attribute knowledge unrelated to the edit, generalizing edits to multimodal reasoning, and maintaining edits under sequential updates. SAKE provides a principled framework to study how knowledge editing extends to the auditory modalities, opening new directions for maintaining and adapting LALMs in more diverse real-world scenarios.

Research investigates the impact of speaker emotion on the safety of large audio-language models, revealing inconsistencies and vulnerabilities that require targeted alignment strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend text-based LLMs with auditory understanding, offering new opportunities for multimodal applications. While their perception, reasoning, and task performance have been widely studied, their safety alignment under paralinguistic variation remains underexplored. This work systematically investigates the role of speaker emotion. We construct a dataset of malicious speech instructions expressed across multiple emotions and intensities, and evaluate several state-of-the-art LALMs. Our results reveal substantial safety inconsistencies: different emotions elicit varying levels of unsafe responses, and the effect of intensity is non-monotonic, with medium expressions often posing the greatest risk. These findings highlight an overlooked vulnerability in LALMs and call for alignment strategies explicitly designed to ensure robustness under emotional variation, a prerequisite for trustworthy deployment in real-world settings.

A benchmark for code-diff understanding with tasks including apply, anti-apply, and diff generation, revealing optimal diff formats based on model size and use case.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reliable handling of code diffs is central to agents that edit and refactor repositories at scale. We introduce Diff-XYZ, a compact benchmark for code-diff understanding with three supervised tasks: apply (old code + diff rightarrow new code), anti-apply (new code - diff rightarrow old code), and diff generation (new code - old code rightarrow diff). Instances in the benchmark are triples langle old code, new code, diff rangle drawn from real commits in CommitPackFT, paired with automatic metrics and a clear evaluation protocol. We use the benchmark to do a focused empirical study of the unified diff format and run a cross-format comparison of different diff representations. Our findings reveal that different formats should be used depending on the use case and model size. For example, representing diffs in search-replace format is good for larger models in the diff generation scenario, yet not suited well for diff analysis and smaller models. The Diff-XYZ benchmark is a reusable foundation for assessing and improving diff handling in LLMs that can aid future development of diff formats and models editing code. The dataset is published on HuggingFace Hub: https://huggingface.co/datasets/JetBrains-Research/diff-xyz.

"A benchmark for code-diff understanding with tasks including apply, anti-apply, and diff generation, revealing optimal diff formats based on model size and use case.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reliable handling of code diffs is central to agents that edit and refactor repositories at scale. We introduce Diff-XYZ, a compact benchmark for code-diff understanding with three supervised tasks: apply (old code + diff rightarrow new code), anti-apply (new code - diff rightarrow old code), and diff generation (new code - old code rightarrow diff). Instances in the benchmark are triples langle old code, new code, diff rangle drawn from real commits in CommitPackFT, paired with automatic metrics and a clear evaluation protocol. We use the benchmark to do a focused empirical study of the unified diff format and run a cross-format comparison of different diff representations. Our findings reveal that different formats should be used depending on the use case and model size. For example, representing diffs in search-replace format is good for larger models in the diff generation scenario, yet not suited well for diff analysis and smaller models. The Diff-XYZ benchmark is a reusable foundation for assessing and improving diff handling in LLMs that can aid future development of diff formats and models editing code. The dataset is published on HuggingFace Hub: https://huggingface.co/datasets/JetBrains-Research/diff-xyz."
