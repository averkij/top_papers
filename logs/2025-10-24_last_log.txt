Text:"5 2 0 2 2 2 ] .

Embeddings power the retrieval component of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications and are widely used across the legal tech industry. In legal RAG applications, lowquality embeddings lead to low-quality search results, which in turn lead to low-quality responses and increased hallucinations [1]. Despite their importance, limited attention has been paid to ensuring that embedding models are genuinely ﬁt for legal information retrieval. Previous attempts at building an industry-standard legal information retrieval benchmark have been limited in quality, size, and diversity. LegalBenchRAG [14] focuses on small set of contractand US-centric datasets, while the legal domain subset of the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB-Legal) [4] exhibits labeling issues and narrow topical coverage. Consequently, existing benchmark performance can fail to predict realworld eﬀectiveness at legal retrieval tasks. MLEB attempts to address those limitations by being larger, more diverse, and of higher quality than previous legal information retrieval benchmarks.LegalBench-RAG evaluates legal information retrieval performance against four pre-existing evaluation sets: ContractNLI [10], Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD) [7], M&A UnderCorresponding author: research@isaacus.com 1https://isaacus.com/mleb 1 standing Dataset (MAUD) [16], and Privacy QA [15]. All datasets center around contracts, largely sourced from the US. In practice, legal professionals and users seeking legal advice or knowledge tend to search for and be interested in much broader range of document types than just contracts, including legislation, regulations, cases, and general legal literature. LegalBench-RAGs narrow focus on contracts thus limits its usefulness for the evaluation of legal embedding models that generalize well to other legal domains and multiple jurisdictions.MTEB-Legal consists of eight datasets: AILA Casedocs [2], AILA Statutes [2], GerDaLIR Small [18], LeCaRDv2 [11], Consumer Contracts QA [9], Legal Summarization [12], Corporate Lobbying [13], and LegalQuAD [8]. Upon manual inspection of two of the English-language datasets in MTEB-Legal, AILA Casedocs2 and AILA Statutes3, we found they contained many query-passage pairs that were totally irrelevant to each other. According to the authors, the datasets had been created using an automated methodology that paired facts stated in certain [Indian] Supreme Court cases with cases and statutes that had been cited by the lawyers arguing those cases. This construction method was employed because actually involving legal experts (e.g., to ﬁnd relevant prior cases / statutes) would have required signiﬁcant amount of ﬁnancial resources and time [2]. In addition to mislabeling, we found that MTEB-Legal lacked diversity in the areas that matter most to legal practitioners and seekers of legal knowledge. Speciﬁcally, of the remaining English-language datasets after exclusion of AILA Casedocs and AILA Statutes, two deal with consumer terms of service (Consumer Contracts QA and Legal Summarization), leaving only one (Corporate Lobbying) that deals with legislation, and none dealing with case law. All such datasets are largely representative of American law. Regarding the non-English-language datasets in the legal split of MTEB, we argue that, in many cases, the legal systems of diﬀerent cultures may fundamentally diﬀer in ways that make crossjurisdictional comparisons (e.g., between the common law system used by Anglosphere countries and Sharia law) of the eﬀectiveness of legal embeddings inappropriate. Furthermore, given that the legal split contains two German datasets, one Chinese dataset, and no other non-English datasets, and that those datasets are concentrated on three select legal tasks, we argue that the inclusion of non-English datasets largely introduces bias and noise in ways that are unlikely to be conducive to real-world performance on most English-language legal information retrieval tasks."

AdaSPEC enhances speculative decoding by selectively filtering tokens during knowledge distillation, improving token acceptance rates without sacrificing generation quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation (KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters. Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at https://github.com/yuezhouhu/adaspec.

Dynamic Position Extrapolation (DyPE) enhances ultra-high-resolution image generation by dynamically adjusting positional encodings in pre-trained diffusion transformers, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity without additional sampling cost.  					AI-generated summary 				 Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation (DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve. Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation, with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions.
