MultiSessionCollab benchmark evaluates agents' ability to learn and adapt to user preferences through persistent memory systems that enhance long-term collaboration quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 As conversational agents accumulate experience collaborating with users, adapting to user preferences is essential for fostering long-term relationships and improving collaboration quality over time. We introduce MultiSessionCollab, a benchmark that evaluates how well agents can learn user preferences and leverage them to improve collaboration quality throughout multiple sessions. To develop agents that succeed in this setting, we present long-term collaborative agents equipped with a memory that persists and refines user preference as interaction experience accumulates. Moreover, we demonstrate that learning signals can be derived from user simulator behavior in MultiSessionCollab to train agents to generate more comprehensive reflections and update their memory more effectively. Extensive experiments show that equipping agents with memory improves long-term collaboration, yielding higher task success rates, more efficient interactions, and reduced user effort. Finally, we conduct a human user study that demonstrates that memory helps improve user experience in real-world settings.

**Reasoning:** The paper focuses on agents learning and adapting to user preferences through persistent memory systems to improve long-term collaboration quality. This directly relates to ALIGNMENT, as the core concern is aligning agent behavior with user preferences and values to foster better long-term relationships and improve collaboration outcomes. The emphasis on learning user preferences and adapting agent behavior accordingly is central to the alignment topic.
