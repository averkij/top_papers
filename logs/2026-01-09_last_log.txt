Text:"RL-AWB: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Auto White Balance Correction in Low-Light Night-time Scenes Yuan-Kang Lee1,3* Kuan-Lin Chen2,3* Chia-Che Chang1 Yu-Lun Liu3 1MediaTek Inc. 2National Taiwan University 3National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University 6 2 0 J 8 ] . [ 1 9 4 2 5 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r Figure 1. Our method achieves optimal parameter tuning for automatic white balance (AWB) in nighttime scenes through hybrid combination of novel statistical color constancy algorithm and reinforcement learning. Due to the complex lighting conditions in night scenes and the presence of significant noise in the images, traditional AWB tuning faces relatively difficult and time-consuming challenges when adapting parameters for night scene images. Our method can optimize parameters for different night scene images at faster speed without requiring prior knowledge of illumination ground-truth, and has better cross-sensor generalization advantages.

Index TermsComputer Vision, knowledge distillation, learning using privileged information, litter detection, object detection I. INTRODUCTION DVANCEMENTS in computing hardware, particularly GPUs, have enabled the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence and automation technologies. Within this landscape, object detection has emerged as cornerstone problem, driving applications in areas such as autonomous systems, environmental monitoring, and robotics. Over the past decade, models such as YOLO [1], Faster R-CNN [2], and RetinaNet [3] have delivered fast and accurate detection capabilities, making object detection widely deployable technology. Despite this progress, achieving consistently high detection accuracy (Corresponding author: Matthias Bartolo.)

Figure 1. Visual comparison of baseline object detection predictions and those of LUPI-trained student model, showing improved accuracy while keeping the same architecture. The figure also illustrates the LUPI training pipeline, including privileged information, teacher models, and knowledge distillation, with these boosts arising solely from the bolstered learning process. remains challenge. Many state-of-the-art detectors rely on increasingly complex architectures [4], [5], which still need to be fine-tuned for specific domain use cases using large annotated datasets [6], both of which introduce significant practical constraints. Deep models often require extensive training time and computational resources, while large-scale datasets demand costly and labour-intensive annotation to improve detection accuracy [6], [7]. However, annotated images contain highly rich information that current state-of-the-art object detection models do not fully exploit. In this study, we test the hypothesis that highly descriptive, fine-grained information can be automatically constructed and leveraged during training to improve object detector performance. Building on our preliminary results [8], we adopt the Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) paradigm [9], [10], [11] and tailor its components for effective use within object detection. The LUPI paradigm addresses problems where information asymmetry exists between training and testing: supplementary information is available during training but not during inference. By leveraging highly informative data streams that are inaccessible at test time, LUPI significantly reduces the requirement for large annotated datasets without sacrificing model accuracy. Privileged information can take many forms, SUBMITTED TO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING, VOL. N/A, NO. N/A, JANUARY 2026 2 including depth cues, saliency maps, high-resolution imagery, or domain-specific annotations [12], [13], [14]. By incorporating such signals, models learn richer feature representations during training, improving generalization and accelerating convergence while maintaining unchanged inference requirements (see Figure 1).is several ways. First, we propose and develop general methodology for injecting privileged information into any deep learning-based object detector. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and not restricted by architectural choices. Second, we investigate the impact of our methodology across five open-source state-of-the-art pretrained object detection models using multiple UAV-based litter detection datasets and the Pascal VOC benchmark. Third, we build upon and significantly extend our earlier work [8] by analyzing performance across object scales, standard COCO metrics, and different forms of privileged information including depth, saliency, and their combinationswhile also examining practical factors such as inference time and model size. Finally, through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate the importance of privileged information for boosting model performance and provide deeper i"

A novel nighttime color constancy framework combines statistical methods with deep reinforcement learning to improve white balance adjustment under low-light conditions.  					AI-generated summary 				 Nighttime color constancy remains a challenging problem in computational photography due to low-light noise and complex illumination conditions. We present RL-AWB, a novel framework combining statistical methods with deep reinforcement learning for nighttime white balance. Our method begins with a statistical algorithm tailored for nighttime scenes, integrating salient gray pixel detection with novel illumination estimation. Building on this foundation, we develop the first deep reinforcement learning approach for color constancy that leverages the statistical algorithm as its core, mimicking professional AWB tuning experts by dynamically optimizing parameters for each image. To facilitate cross-sensor evaluation, we introduce the first multi-sensor nighttime dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves superior generalization capability across low-light and well-illuminated images. Project page: https://ntuneillee.github.io/research/rl-awb/

AT²PO is a unified framework for multi-turn agentic reinforcement learning that improves exploration diversity, credit assignment, and policy optimization through tree search and turn-level learning objectives.  					AI-generated summary 				 LLM agents have emerged as powerful systems for tackling multi-turn tasks by interleaving internal reasoning and external tool interactions. Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT^2PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT^2PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 1.84 percentage points in average, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component. Our code is available at https://github.com/zzfoutofspace/ATPO.

Learning Using Privileged Information paradigm enhances object detection accuracy by integrating additional training-time information through teacher-student architectures without increasing inference complexity.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper investigates the integration of the Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) paradigm in object detection to exploit fine-grained, descriptive information available during training but not at inference. We introduce a general, model-agnostic methodology for injecting privileged information-such as bounding box masks, saliency maps, and depth cues-into deep learning-based object detectors through a teacher-student architecture. Experiments are conducted across five state-of-the-art object detection models and multiple public benchmarks, including UAV-based litter detection datasets and Pascal VOC 2012, to assess the impact on accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LUPI-trained students consistently outperform their baseline counterparts, achieving significant boosts in detection accuracy with no increase in inference complexity or model size. Performance improvements are especially marked for medium and large objects, while ablation studies reveal that intermediate weighting of teacher guidance optimally balances learning from privileged and standard inputs. The findings affirm that the LUPI framework provides an effective and practical strategy for advancing object detection systems in both resource-constrained and real-world settings.
