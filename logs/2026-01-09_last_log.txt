Text:"Guardians of the Hair: Rescuing Soft Boundaries in Depth, Stereo, and Novel Views Xiang Zhang1,2 Yang Zhang2 Lukas Mehl2 Markus Gross1,2 Christopher Schroers2 1ETH Zurich 2DisneyResearchStudios 6 2 0 2 J 6 ] . [ 1 2 6 3 3 0 . 1 0 6 2 : r Figure 1. Our Mission. The Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard) aim to rescue soft boundary details, e.g., thin hairs, where foreground and background are mixed in the observed color. Previous state-of-the-art approaches often suffer from missing details (see depth estimation results), degraded texture (see stereo results, displayed in anaglyph), and inconsistent geometry (see novel views) in soft boundaries. In contrast, HairGuard preserves fine-grained soft boundary details and demonstrates strong performance across diverse tasks. "

"Re-Align addresses the gap between understanding and generation in in-context image generation and editing through structured reasoning-guided alignment and reinforcement learning training.  					AI-generated summary 				 In-context image generation and editing (ICGE) enables users to specify visual concepts through interleaved image-text prompts, demanding precise understanding and faithful execution of user intent. Although recent unified multimodal models exhibit promising understanding capabilities, these strengths often fail to transfer effectively to image generation. We introduce Re-Align, a unified framework that bridges the gap between understanding and generation through structured reasoning-guided alignment. At its core lies the In-Context Chain-of-Thought (IC-CoT), a structured reasoning paradigm that decouples semantic guidance and reference association, providing clear textual target and mitigating confusion among reference images. Furthermore, Re-Align introduces an effective RL training scheme that leverages a surrogate reward to measure the alignment between structured reasoning text and the generated image, thereby improving the model's overall performance on ICGE tasks. Extensive experiments verify that Re-Align outperforms competitive methods of comparable model scale and resources on both in-context image generation and editing tasks."

HairGuard is a framework for recovering fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks through specialized depth refinement and view synthesis techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 Soft boundaries, like thin hairs, are commonly observed in natural and computer-generated imagery, but they remain challenging for 3D vision due to the ambiguous mixing of foreground and background cues. This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, with significant improvements in soft boundary regions.
