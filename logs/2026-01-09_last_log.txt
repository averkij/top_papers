Prior work suggests that stochastic gradient noise induces Brownian-like expansion of the weight matrices , whose growth is counteracted by WD, leading to WD-noise equilibrium with certain weight norm . In this work, we view the equilibrium norm as harmful artifact of the training procedure, and address it by introducing learnable multipliers to learn the optimal scale. First, we attach learnable scalar multiplier to and confirm that the WDnoise equilibrium norm is suboptimal: the learned scale adapts to data and improves performance. We then argue that individual row and column norms are similarly constrained, and free their scale by introducing learnable per-row and per-column multipliers. Our method can be viewed as learnable, more expressive generalization of µP multipliers. It outperforms well-tuned µP baseline, reduces the computational overhead of multiplier tuning, and surfaces practical questions such as forward-pass symmetries and the width-scaling of the learned multipliers. Finally, we validate learnable multipliers with both Adam and Muon optimizers, where it shows improvement in downstream evaluations matching the improvement of the switching from Adam to Muon. 1. Pretraining large-scale language models presents significant challenges for both the optimization algorithm and the choice of hyperparameters. The most widely used and reliable optimizer is Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015), or, rather, its weight decay version AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) that incorporates decay directly in the parameter update: θt θt ηλθt, where η is the learning rate (LR) and λ the weight decay hyperparame"

Visual identity prompting enhances manipulation data augmentation for robot policies by providing explicit visual guidance to diffusion models, improving policy performance in both simulation and real-world settings.  					AI-generated summary 				 The diversity, quantity, and quality of manipulation data are critical for training effective robot policies. However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup. To this end, we also build a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets. Using our augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings.

Learnable multipliers are introduced to address weight decay-induced normalization artifacts in large language model training, outperforming traditional methods while reducing computational overhead.  					AI-generated summary 				 Applying weight decay (WD) to matrix layers is standard practice in large-language-model pretraining. Prior work suggests that stochastic gradient noise induces a Brownian-like expansion of the weight matrices W, whose growth is counteracted by WD, leading to a WD-noise equilibrium with a certain weight norm ||W||. In this work, we view the equilibrium norm as a harmful artifact of the training procedure, and address it by introducing learnable multipliers to learn the optimal scale. First, we attach a learnable scalar multiplier to W and confirm that the WD-noise equilibrium norm is suboptimal: the learned scale adapts to data and improves performance. We then argue that individual row and column norms are similarly constrained, and free their scale by introducing learnable per-row and per-column multipliers. Our method can be viewed as a learnable, more expressive generalization of muP multipliers. It outperforms a well-tuned muP baseline, reduces the computational overhead of multiplier tuning, and surfaces practical questions such as forward-pass symmetries and the width-scaling of the learned multipliers. Finally, we validate learnable multipliers with both Adam and Muon optimizers, where it shows improvement in downstream evaluations matching the improvement of the switching from Adam to Muon.

Метод включает обучаемые скалярные множители для каждой матрицы, а также отдельные множители для строк и столбцов, что представляет собой более выразительное обобщение подхода muP.
