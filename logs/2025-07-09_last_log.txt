Text:"5 2 0 2 8 ] . [ 1 1 8 1 6 0 . 7 0 5 2 : r CriticLean: Critic-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Mathematical FormalizationFull author list in ContributionsTranslating natural language mathematical statements into formal, executable code is fundamental challenge in automated theorem proving. While prior work has focused on generation and compilation success, little attention has been paid to the critic phasethe evaluation of whether generated formalizations truly capture the semantic intent of the original problem. In this paper, we introduce CriticLean, novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework that elevates the role of the critic from passive validator to an active learning component. Specifically, first, we propose the CriticLeanGPT, trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to rigorously assess the semantic fidelity of Lean 4 formalizations. Then, we introduce CriticLeanBench, benchmark designed to measure models ability to distinguish semantically correct from incorrect formalizations, and demonstrate that our trained CriticLeanGPT models can significantly outperform strong openand closed-source baselines. Building on the CriticLean framework, we construct FineLeanCorpus, dataset comprising over 285K problems that exhibits rich domain diversity, broad difficulty coverage, and high correctness based on human evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight that optimizing the critic phase is essential for producing reliable formalizations and we hope our CriticLean will provide valuable insights for future advances in formal mathematical reasoning. Date: July 8, 2025 Correspondence: liujiaheng@nju.edu.cn, zhangge.eli@bytedance.com Project Page: https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/CriticLeanThe formalization of mathematical statements [64] is critical task in modern mathematical computation, particularly in the context of theorem provers like Lean 4 [22]. The translation of natural language mathematical problems into formal, executable code remains significant challenge, as it requires not only syntactical accuracy but also deep understanding of the problems semantics [44, 49]. Existing approaches have shown progress, but they often face limitations in accuracy, especially in the context of complex, high-level problems that involve sophisticated mathematical reasoning [3, 23, 58, 59, 75]. In contrast to existing works, we argue that the critic phasethe step where the semantic correctness of generated formalizations is evaluatedis not only underexplored but also fundamentally essential to the success of mathematical autoformalization. Therefore, in this paper, we systematically investigate and optimize the critic component and introduce CriticLean, comprehensive framework that places the critic model at the center of the formalization pipeline. Unlike prior work that primarily focuses on generation quality or compiler validity, CriticLean introduces the reinforcement learning-based CriticLeanGPT models explicitly trained to evaluate whether the Lean 4 output truly reflects the intent of the original mathematical statement., and we present full methodology for 1 Figure 1 Autoformalization. Illustration of CriticLean framework based on Critic-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Mathematics training, and evaluating CriticLeanGPT model. Specifically, as shown in Figure 1, for each natural language statement, we apply the autoformalization iteratively based on the feedback from the Lean compiler and the CriticLeanGPT models, which is trained to critically assess whether generated formalization accurately represents the semantics of the original mathematical statement. In each iteration, the feedback provides valuable signals that drive an iterative refinement process, further improving the quality of the final Lean code output. Additionally, we present CriticLeanBench, benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of CriticLeanGPT models, which contain 500 natural language and Lean 4 language statement pairs (i.e., 250 correct and 250 incorrect pairs). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our trained CriticLeanGPT models outperform the SOTA open-source models [4, 10, 11] and many closed-source API models [9, 12, 42] greatly. Furthermore, building upon our critic-centric CriticLean pipeline, we propose the high-quality open-source Lean 4 statement dataset FineLeanCorpus, comprising 285,957 fully verified entries. When compared to the previous related datasets (e.g., LeanWorkBook [65]), FineLeanCorpus is distinguished by its diversity in mathematical domains, difficulty distribution, and strict semantic validation via critical feedback loops. Notably, its difficulty distribution and targeted domain enrichment create more structurally balanced training environment, mitigating overfitting and transforming sparse topics into well-supported sub-domains. Furthermore, to foster research into the upper echelons of mathematical reasoning, we have curated the specialized subset called FineLeanCorpus-Diamond, comprising over 36,000 high-difficulty problems. .Autoformalization [48, 60, 68] refers to the process by which AI systems parse natural language (NL) contents and translate them into machine-verifiable formal representations, such as those in theorem provers like Lean4 [38] or Isabelle [40]. Recent advances leverage large language models (LLMs) [72] to tackle this problem through two primary paradigms: (1) In-context learning [57], where models utilize annotated examples [28, 33, 60] to generate formalizations without explicit fine-tuning, (2) Supervised fine-tuning (e.g., [26, 61, 67]), which adapts general-purpose LLMs into domain-specific autoformalization experts. To assess correctness, prior works [26, 61, 67] employ LLM-as-judge [76] to verify semantic alignment between formal and informal statements. We advance this by training the first open-sourced, domain-specific light LLM on top of Qwen [52] family for critiquing Lean4 statement alignment via reinforcement learning [46], enhancing 2 both critique capability and formalization robustness."

Text:"MedGen: Unlocking Medical Video Generation by Scaling Granularly-annotated Medical Videos Rongsheng Wang1*Junying Chen1*, Ke Ji1, Zhenyang Cai1, Shunian Chen1, Yunjin Yang1, Benyou Wang1 1The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen wangbenyou@cuhk.edu.cn https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/MedGen 5 2 0 2 8 ] . [ 1 5 7 6 5 0 . 7 0 5 2 : r Abstract Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios, providing strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our dataset and model can serve as valuable resource and help catalyze further research in medical video generation. Disclaimer: This paper contains clinical content that may be disturbing to some readers. Recent advances in video generation have led to impressive breakthroughs, with models now capable of producing high-quality, cinematic visuals that align closely with user prompts (Blattmann et al. 2023). In particular, latent video diffusion models (LVDMs), such as Sora (OpenAI 2025) and Veo (Sharma et al. 2024), have achieved state-of-theart performance by operating efficiently in latent space and"

Progress has been held back by two key challengesfirst, narrow focus on singlestep tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions, and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses two-stage pipeline, training Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate Llama 3.3 70B teacher via SFT, followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices exhaustive sweeps are impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy only requires 55% of the compute to match the peak of pure SFT on MiniWob++, pushing the computeperformance Pareto frontier and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models. Figure 1: Computeperformance frontier on MiniWoB++ (results averaged over two seeds). The blue curve shows pure SFT on teacher demonstrations. Warm-colored curves represent hybrid runs that branch off from SFT checkpoints and continue training with RL. Early transitions to RL push the Pareto frontierachieving higher success rates for the same computeand is the only approach able to achieve over 30% improvement on both held-out goals (left) and held-out tasks (right) closing the gap between open and closed-source models. *Equal contribution 1ServiceNow Research 2MilaQuebec AI Institute 5McGill University 6Univeristé de Montréal 4HEC Montréal 3Polytechnique Montréal Preprint. Under review.Large language model (LLM) agents for web interfaces have advanced rapidly, but open-source systems still trail proprietary ones. Bridging this gap would allow organizations to train smaller, cost-efficient agents tailored to their needs while maintaining data privacy. Yet, despite impressive progress of open-source models in domains like math and code generation, advances in training web-capable LLM agents remain limited by two persistent challenges: lack of attention to multi-turn, long-horizon tasks, and the high cost and low reproducibility of current training pipelines. Most research centers on single-step tasks like code or mathdomains with rapid feedback and simplified credit assignmentwhich fall short of real-world web environments requiring sequential decisions and long-horizon planning. Recent benchmarks like WebArena [25], WorkArena [10], OSWorld [22], and The Agent Company [23] have exposed how brittle current methods become under delayed rewards, sparse feedback, and compounding errors. Addressing these settings demands not just better agents, but reproducible, compute-efficient training pipelinesan area we directly tackle. However, building such pipelines is nontrivial. Modern LLM post-training often involves combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), with performance sensitive to large number of interacting hyperparameters [11]. Single-seed results are noisy and misleading, but exhaustive tuning and multi-seed sweeps, e.g. [2], remain infeasible for most labs due to the cost of LLM training. This makes it all the more critical to design pipelines that are not only effective but statistically robust and accessible within realistic compute budgets. In this paper, we tackle these gaps by providing statistically driven diagnosis of training LLM agents for web-based, multi-step tasks. Specifically, we study how to allocate compute between expensive, high-quality off-policy demonstrations from large teacher model and cheaper on-policy rollouts from smaller student model. We analyze this tradeoff across two levels of generalization: held-out goalstasks encountered during training but with novel goalsand held-out tasks, which are entirely unseen during training. To study this compute-performance trade-off we use two-stage training pipeline. First, LLaMA 3.3 70B teacher model generates successful trajectories to warm-start smaller LLaMA 3.1 8B student via SFT. We then branch of various SFT checkpoints where training continues with an on-policy RL phase using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [9]. Our central objective is to determine the optimal compute allocation and hyperparameter mix for training web-based LLM agents. To this end, we run 1,370 training configurations, varying key hyperparameters and branching points between SFT and RL. We then apply bootstrap-based analysis to estimate the impact of different hyper-parameters on downstream performance and how they vary across branching SFT checkpoints. This data-driven approach enables us to identify important considerations to get the most out of each run. We use this method to show the optimal mix between SFT and RL in the MiniWob++ environment, achieving better task accuracy at significantly lower cost. Additionally, we provide concrete recommendations on compute allocations between SFT and RL on the more demanding WorkArena environment. Putting things together, we show how our study yields several actionable insights. First, branching into RL earlybut not immediatelyafter SFT leads to better outcomes. This hybrid strategy consistently outperforms pure SFT and pure RL, and reaches the maximal performance of pure SFT while requiring only 55% of the compute, effectively pushing the computeperformance Pareto frontier. It is also the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models. Second, curriculum learning and error log feedback help the less SFT warmup has been applied but can become counterproductive thereafter. Third, in GRPO, applying zero-advantage filtering consistently improve performance, while dividing the advant"

Latent reasoning enhances large language models by performing multi-step inference in continuous hidden states, improving efficiency and expressiveness beyond token-level supervision.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning, highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations. Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the frontier of LLM cognition.

AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios, providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy.

"MedGen, a model trained on the large-scale MedVideoCap-55K dataset, achieves top performance in medical video generation by balancing visual quality and medical accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios, providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further research in medical video generation. Our code and data is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/MedGen"

The Code Triangle framework evaluates large language models across editorial analysis, code implementation, and test case generation, revealing limitations in diversity and robustness compared to human programmers and suggesting enhancements through human-generated content and model mixtures.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, yet their true programming competence remains underexplored. We introduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs across three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation, and test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive programming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent system across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and robustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift between model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to cluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study demonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and diverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially enhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal both the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential direction for developing more powerful coding models.

OmniPart generates part-aware 3D objects with high semantic decoupling and robust structural cohesion using an autoregressive structure planning module and a spatially-conditioned rectified flow model.  					AI-generated summary 				 The creation of 3D assets with explicit, editable part structures is crucial for advancing interactive applications, yet most generative methods produce only monolithic shapes, limiting their utility. We introduce OmniPart, a novel framework for part-aware 3D object generation designed to achieve high semantic decoupling among components while maintaining robust structural cohesion. OmniPart uniquely decouples this complex task into two synergistic stages: (1) an autoregressive structure planning module generates a controllable, variable-length sequence of 3D part bounding boxes, critically guided by flexible 2D part masks that allow for intuitive control over part decomposition without requiring direct correspondences or semantic labels; and (2) a spatially-conditioned rectified flow model, efficiently adapted from a pre-trained holistic 3D generator, synthesizes all 3D parts simultaneously and consistently within the planned layout. Our approach supports user-defined part granularity, precise localization, and enables diverse downstream applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art performance, paving the way for more interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D content.

Tora2 enhances motion-guided video generation by introducing a decoupled personalization extractor, gated self-attention mechanism, and contrastive loss, enabling simultaneous multi-entity customization and advanced motion control.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in diffusion transformer models for motion-guided video generation, such as Tora, have shown significant progress. In this paper, we present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a critical advancement in multi-condition video generation.

"Tora2 enhances motion-guided video generation by introducing a decoupled personalization extractor, gated self-attention mechanism, and contrastive loss, enabling simultaneous multi-entity customization and advanced motion control.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in diffusion transformer models for motion-guided video generation, such as Tora, have shown significant progress. In this paper, we present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a critical advancement in multi-condition video generation.

A study on compute allocation for post-training LLM-based web agents finds that combining supervised fine-tuning with on-policy reinforcement learning improves performance and reduces computational costs compared to either method alone.  					AI-generated summary 				 LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.
