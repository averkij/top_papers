Given single input image (left), SceneDINO predicts both 3D scene geometry and 3D features in the form of feature field (middle) in feed-forward manner, capturing the structure and semantics of the scene. Unsupervised distillation and clustering of SceneDINOs feature space leads to unsupervised semantic scene completion predictions (right). "

SceneDINO achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy in unsupervised semantic scene completion by leveraging self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding techniques.  					AI-generated summary 				 Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to infer both the 3D geometry and semantics of a scene from single images. In contrast to prior work on SSC that heavily relies on expensive ground-truth annotations, we approach SSC in an unsupervised setting. Our novel method, SceneDINO, adapts techniques from self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding to SSC. Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency self-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given a single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO features in a feed-forward manner. Through a novel 3D feature distillation approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current supervised SSC approach. Additionally, we showcase the domain generalization and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO, taking the first steps towards a strong foundation for single image 3D scene understanding.
