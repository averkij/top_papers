FAROS is a framework that enhances fairness in graph diffusion models by strategically switching node attributes during generation to balance accuracy and fairness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in graph diffusion models (GDMs) have enabled the synthesis of realistic network structures, yet ensuring fairness in the generated data remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate bias by re-training the GDMs with ad-hoc fairness constraints. Conversely, with this work, we propose FAROS, a novel FAir graph geneRatiOn framework leveraging attribute Switching mechanisms and directly running in the generation process of the pre-trained GDM. Technically, our approach works by altering nodes' sensitive attributes during the generation. To this end, FAROS calculates the optimal fraction of switching nodes, and selects the diffusion step to perform the switch by setting tailored multi-criteria constraints to preserve the node-topology profile from the original distribution (a proxy for accuracy) while ensuring the edge independence on the sensitive attributes for the generated graph (a proxy for fairness). Our experiments on benchmark datasets for link prediction demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces fairness discrepancies while maintaining comparable (or even higher) accuracy performance to other similar baselines. Noteworthy, FAROS is also able to strike a better accuracy-fairness trade-off than other competitors in some of the tested settings under the Pareto optimality concept, demonstrating the effectiveness of the imposed multi-criteria constraints.

Он рассчитывает оптимальную долю переключаемых узлов и выбирает шаг диффузии для переключения, устанавливая специальные многокритериальные ограничения. Это позволяет сохранить профиль топологии узлов из исходного распределения, обеспечивая при этом независимость ребер от чувствительных атрибутов в сгенерированном графе. Эксперименты показывают, что FAROS эффективно снижает неравенство, сохраняя при этом сопоставимую или даже более высокую точность по сравнению с другими базовыми методами.",
