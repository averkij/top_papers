Recent segment anything efforts show promise by learning from large-scale data, but adapting such models directly to medical images remains challenging due to the complexity of medical data, noisy annotations, and continual learning requirements across diverse modalities and anatomical structures. In this work, we propose SAMed-2, new foundation model for medical image segmentation built upon the SAM-2 architecture. Specifically, we introduce temporal adapter into the image encoder to capture image correlations and confidence-driven memory mechanism to store high-certainty features for later retrieval. This memory-based strategy counters the pervasive noise in large-scale medical datasets and mitigates catastrophic forgetting when encountering new tasks or modalities. To train and evaluate SAMed-2, we curate MedBank-100k, comprehensive dataset spanning seven imaging modalities and 21 medical segmentation tasks. Our experiments on both internal benchmarks and 10 external datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in multi-task scenarios. The code is available at: https://github.com/ZhilingYan/Medical-SAM-Bench. Medical image segmentation plays pivotal role in clinical practice, supporting disease diagnosis, surgical planning, and treatment evaluation [12].

Text:"5 2 0 2 8 ] . [ 1 1 8 1 6 0 . 7 0 5 2 : r CriticLean: Critic-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Mathematical FormalizationFull author list in ContributionsTranslating natural language mathematical statements into formal, executable code is fundamental challenge in automated theorem proving. While prior work has focused on generation and compilation success, little attention has been paid to the critic phasethe evaluation of whether generated formalizations truly capture the semantic intent of the original problem. In this paper, we introduce CriticLean, novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework that elevates the role of the critic from passive validator to an active learning component. Specifically, first, we propose the CriticLeanGPT, trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to rigorously assess the semantic fidelity of Lean 4 formalizations. Then, we introduce CriticLeanBench, benchmark designed to measure models ability to distinguish semantically correct from incorrect formalizations, and demonstrate that our trained CriticLeanGPT models can significantly outperform strong openand closed-source baselines. Building on the CriticLean framework, we construct FineLeanCorpus, dataset comprising over 285K problems that exhibits rich domain diversity, broad difficulty coverage, and high correctness based on human evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight that optimizing the critic phase is essential for producing reliable formalizations and we hope our CriticLean will provide valuable insights for future advances in formal mathematical reasoning. Date: July 8, 2025 Correspondence: liujiaheng@nju.edu.cn, zhangge.eli@bytedance.com Project Page: https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/CriticLeanThe formalization of mathematical statements [64] is critical task in modern mathematical computation, particularly in the context of theorem provers like Lean 4 [22]. The translation of natural language mathematical problems into formal, executable code remains significant challenge, as it requires not only syntactical accuracy but also deep understanding of the problems semantics [44, 49]. Existing approaches have shown progress, but they often face limitations in accuracy, especially in the context of complex, high-level problems that involve sophisticated mathematical reasoning [3, 23, 58, 59, 75]. In contrast to existing works, we argue that the critic phasethe step where the semantic correctness of generated formalizations is evaluatedis not only underexplored but also fundamentally essential to the success of mathematical autoformalization. Therefore, in this paper, we systematically investigate and optimize the critic component and introduce CriticLean, comprehensive framework that places the critic model at the center of the formalization pipeline. Unlike prior work that primarily focuses on generation quality or compiler validity, CriticLean introduces the reinforcement learning-based CriticLeanGPT models explicitly trained to evaluate whether the Lean 4 output truly reflects the intent of the original mathematical statement., and we present full methodology for 1 Figure 1 Autoformalization. Illustration of CriticLean framework based on Critic-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Mathematics training, and evaluating CriticLeanGPT model. Specifically, as shown in Figure 1, for each natural language statement, we apply the autoformalization iteratively based on the feedback from the Lean compiler and the CriticLeanGPT models, which is trained to critically assess whether generated formalization accurately represents the semantics of the original mathematical statement. In each iteration, the feedback provides valuable signals that drive an iterative refinement process, further improving the quality of the final Lean code output. Additionally, we present CriticLeanBench, benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of CriticLeanGPT models, which contain 500 natural language and Lean 4 language statement pairs (i.e., 250 correct and 250 incorrect pairs). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our trained CriticLeanGPT models outperform the SOTA open-source models [4, 10, 11] and many closed-source API models [9, 12, 42] greatly. Furthermore, building upon our critic-centric CriticLean pipeline, we propose the high-quality open-source Lean 4 statement dataset FineLeanCorpus, comprising 285,957 fully verified entries. When compared to the previous related datasets (e.g., LeanWorkBook [65]), FineLeanCorpus is distinguished by its diversity in mathematical domains, difficulty distribution, and strict semantic validation via critical feedback loops. Notably, its difficulty distribution and targeted domain enrichment create more structurally balanced training environment, mitigating overfitting and transforming sparse topics into well-supported sub-domains. Furthermore, to foster research into the upper echelons of mathematical reasoning, we have curated the specialized subset called FineLeanCorpus-Diamond, comprising over 36,000 high-difficulty problems. .Autoformalization [48, 60, 68] refers to the process by which AI systems parse natural language (NL) contents and translate them into machine-verifiable formal representations, such as those in theorem provers like Lean4 [38] or Isabelle [40]. Recent advances leverage large language models (LLMs) [72] to tackle this problem through two primary paradigms: (1) In-context learning [57], where models utilize annotated examples [28, 33, 60] to generate formalizations without explicit fine-tuning, (2) Supervised fine-tuning (e.g., [26, 61, 67]), which adapts general-purpose LLMs into domain-specific autoformalization experts. To assess correctness, prior works [26, 61, 67] employ LLM-as-judge [76] to verify semantic alignment between formal and informal statements. We advance this by training the first open-sourced, domain-specific light LLM on top of Qwen [52] family for critiquing Lean4 statement alignment via reinforcement learning [46], enhancing 2 both critique capability and formalization robustness."

[ 1 0 1 6 4 0 . 7 0 5 2 : r Abstract We present any4, learned 4-bit weight quantization solution for large language models (LLMs) providing arbitrary numeric representations without requiring pre-processing of weights or activations. any4 yields higher accuracy compared to other related 4-bit numeric representation types: int4, fp4 and nf4, as evaluated on range of model sizes, generations and families (Llama 2, Llama 3, Mistral and Mixtral). While any4 does not require preprocessing of weights or activations, it is also competitive with orthogonal techniques that require such preprocessing (e.g., AWQ and GPTQ). We also experiment with any3 and any2 and show competitiveness at lower bits. Additionally, we show that we can calibrate using single curated diverse sample rather than hundreds of samples from dataset as done in most quantization approaches. We also open source tinygemm, latency optimized GPU matrix multiplication library for LLMs, that implements any4 using GPU-efficient lookup table strategy along with other common quantization methods. We open source our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/any4. 1.

[ 1 8 7 5 5 0 . 7 0 5 2 : r The Landscape of Memorization in LLMs: Mechanisms, Measurement, and Mitigation Alexander Xiong1, Xuandong Zhao1, Aneesh Pappu2, Dawn Song1 1University of California, Berkeley 2Google DeepMind {alexxiong,xuandongzhao,dawnsong}@berkeley.edu, aneeshpappu@google.com Abstract Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training data. This phenomenon raises critical questions about model behavior, privacy risks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these concerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape of memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and mitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication, training dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization. In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction, membership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data cleaning, differential privacy, and posttraining unlearning, while highlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful memorization with utility. This paper provides comprehensive overview of the current state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and performance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work. Throughout the past few years, we have observed great strides in the capabilities of LLMs driven by changes in model architecture, training methodologies, and computational resources [Radford et al., 2018, Brown et al., 2020, Chowdhery et al., 2023, Naveed et al., 2023, Touvron et al., 2023, Wei et al., 2023].

An end-to-end reinforcement learning framework using simulated user emotion rewards enhances emotional intelligence in large language models while maintaining cognitive skills.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) excel at logical and algorithmic reasoning, yet their emotional intelligence (EQ) still lags far behind their cognitive prowess. While reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced in other domains, its application to dialogue-especially for emotional intelligence-remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RLVER, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifiable emotion rewards from simulated users to cultivate higher-order empathetic abilities in LLMs. Within this framework, self-consistent affective simulated users engage in dialogue rollouts and produce deterministic emotion scores during conversations, serving as reward signals to guide the LLM's learning. Fine-tuning publicly available Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model with PPO boosts its Sentient-Benchmark score from 13.3 to 79.2 while largely preserving mathematical and coding competence. Extensive experiments reveal that: (i) RLVER consistently improves multiple dialogue capabilities; (ii) Thinking and non-thinking models show distinct trends--thinking models excel in empathy and insight, while non-thinking models favor action; (iii) GRPO often yields stable gains, while PPO can push certain capabilities to a higher ceiling; (iv) More challenging environments are not always better-moderate ones can yield stronger outcomes. Our results show that RLVER is a practical route toward emotionally intelligent and broadly capable language agents.

E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs evaluates LLM-based rerankers by measuring relevance and throughput per PetaFLOP, providing a hardware-agnostic metric for efficiency and effectiveness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens. However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size, making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose E2R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

GTA1 addresses task planning ambiguity and visual grounding in GUI interactions using test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms (e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements. Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step. However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning (i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual targets.   This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning (RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments, rewarding successful clicks on interface elements.   Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7% accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.

"GTA1 addresses task planning ambiguity and visual grounding in GUI interactions using test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms (e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements. Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step. However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning (i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual targets.   This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning (RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments, rewarding successful clicks on interface elements.   Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7% accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here."

SAMed-2, an adaptation of SAM-2 for medical image segmentation, incorporates a temporal adapter and confidence-driven memory to improve performance across diverse medical datasets and tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent "segment anything" efforts show promise by learning from large-scale data, but adapting such models directly to medical images remains challenging due to the complexity of medical data, noisy annotations, and continual learning requirements across diverse modalities and anatomical structures. In this work, we propose SAMed-2, a new foundation model for medical image segmentation built upon the SAM-2 architecture. Specifically, we introduce a temporal adapter into the image encoder to capture image correlations and a confidence-driven memory mechanism to store high-certainty features for later retrieval. This memory-based strategy counters the pervasive noise in large-scale medical datasets and mitigates catastrophic forgetting when encountering new tasks or modalities. To train and evaluate SAMed-2, we curate MedBank-100k, a comprehensive dataset spanning seven imaging modalities and 21 medical segmentation tasks. Our experiments on both internal benchmarks and 10 external datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in multi-task scenarios. The code is available at: https://github.com/ZhilingYan/Medical-SAM-Bench.

CriticLean, a reinforcement learning framework with CriticLeanGPT and CriticLeanBench, enhances semantic evaluation in automated theorem proving by actively learning to distinguish correct from incorrect formalizations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Translating natural language mathematical statements into formal, executable code is a fundamental challenge in automated theorem proving. While prior work has focused on generation and compilation success, little attention has been paid to the critic phase-the evaluation of whether generated formalizations truly capture the semantic intent of the original problem. In this paper, we introduce CriticLean, a novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework that elevates the role of the critic from a passive validator to an active learning component. Specifically, first, we propose the CriticLeanGPT, trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to rigorously assess the semantic fidelity of Lean 4 formalizations. Then, we introduce CriticLeanBench, a benchmark designed to measure models' ability to distinguish semantically correct from incorrect formalizations, and demonstrate that our trained CriticLeanGPT models can significantly outperform strong open- and closed-source baselines. Building on the CriticLean framework, we construct FineLeanCorpus, a dataset comprising over 285K problems that exhibits rich domain diversity, broad difficulty coverage, and high correctness based on human evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight that optimizing the critic phase is essential for producing reliable formalizations, and we hope our CriticLean will provide valuable insights for future advances in formal mathematical reasoning.

Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality, multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818 interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories, consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The dataset and source code of PRING are available at https://github.com/SophieSarceau/PRING.

"Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality, multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818 interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories, consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The dataset and source code of PRING are available at https://github.com/SophieSarceau/PRING."

Investigation into data diversity in robotic manipulation reveals that task diversity is crucial, multi-embodiment data is optional, and expert diversity can be confounding, leading to a distribution debiasing method for improved performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Data scaling has driven remarkable success in foundation models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), yet the principles of effective data scaling in robotic manipulation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do), embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2) multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity, arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation datasets effectively.

The paper reviews recent studies on memorization in Large Language Models, exploring factors that influence memorization, detection methodologies, and mitigation strategies, while addressing privacy and ethical implications.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training data. This phenomenon raises critical questions about model behavior, privacy risks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these concerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape of memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and mitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication, training dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization. In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction, membership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data cleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while highlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful memorization with utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and performance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work.

"The paper reviews recent studies on memorization in Large Language Models, exploring factors that influence memorization, detection methodologies, and mitigation strategies, while addressing privacy and ethical implications.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training data. This phenomenon raises critical questions about model behavior, privacy risks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these concerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape of memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and mitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication, training dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization. In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction, membership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data cleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while highlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful memorization with utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and performance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work."
