Text:"SimpleGPT: Improving GPT via Simple Normalization Strategy Marco Chen 1 * Xianbiao Qi 2 * Yelin He 2 Jiaquan Ye 2 Rong Xiao 2 6 2 0 2 1 ] . [ 1 2 1 2 1 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aIn this work, we revisit Transformer optimization through the lens of second-order geometry and establish direct connection between architectural design, activation scale, the Hessian matrix, and the maximum tolerable learning rate. We introduce simple normalization strategy, termed SimpleNorm, which stabilizes intermediate activation scales by construction. Then, by analyzing the Hessian of the loss with respect to network activations, we theoretically show that SimpleNorm significantly reduces the spectral norm of the Hessian, thereby permitting larger stable learning rates. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on large GPT models at parameter scales 1B, 1.4B, 7B and 8B. Empirically, SimpleGPT, our SimpleNorm-based network, tolerates learning rates 3-10 larger than standard convention, consistently demonstrates strong optimization stability, and achieves substantially better performance than well-established baselines. Specifically, when training 7B-scale models for 60K steps, SimpleGPT achieves training loss that is 0.08 lower than that of LLaMA2 with QKNorm, reducing the loss from 2.290 to 2.208. Our source code will be released at https: //github.com/Ocram7/SimpleGPT. 1. Introduction Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) (Radford et al., 2018; 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Dubey et al., 2024; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Team, 2023) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across wide range of tasks. As these models scale in depth and width, optimization stability increasingly constrains performance and scalability. Many architectural components in modern Transformerssuch as residual connections (He et al., 2016), normalization layers (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015; Ba et al., 2016; Zhang & Sennrich, 2019; *Equal contribution 1Tsinghua University 2Intellifusion Inc.. Correspondence to: Xianbiao Qi <qixianbiao@gmail.com>. Preprint. February 3, 2026. 1 Large et al., 2024), and nonlinear activations (Shazeer, 2020)are primarily introduced to stabilize training, and in some cases to increase expressivity. Understanding optimization from principled perspective is therefore central to the design of scalable Transformer architectures. Classical optimization theory (Nesterov, 1983; 1998; Nocedal & Wright, 1999; Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004) provides precise connection between optimization stability and second-order geometry. For twice-differentiable objective ℓ(x), the local curvature is characterized by the Hessian Hxx = 2ℓ(x). If ℓ is β-smooth, then ℓ(x) ℓ(y)2 βx y2, x, y. Standard results imply that gradient descent is stable only when the maximum tolerable learning rate η satisfies η 2 β = 2 supx Hxx2 , establishing the Hessian spectral norm as the fundamental quantity governing admissible learning rates and convergence behavior. In contrast, much of the recent literature on Transformer optimization focuses on architectural heuristics without explicitly analyzing their relationship with classical optimization theory. Techniques such as normalization placement (Vaswani et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019; Henry et al., 2020; Qi et al., 2023a; 2025c;a), residual scaling (He et al., 2016; Bachlechner et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2025), or modified nonlinearities (Hendrycks, 2016; Shazeer, 2020) are typically justified empirically, while their impact on activation scale, Hessian geometry, and thereby optimal learning rates remains implicit. As result, the theoretical relationship between network design and classical stability conditions is not well understood, despite its relevance to training very deep and large-scale models. In this work, we bridge this gap by analyzing Transformer architectures through the central lens of Hessian-based optimization theory, while accounting for the role of activation scale. We introduce simple normalization strategy, termed SimpleNorm, which stabilizes intermediate activation scales through normalization immediately following linear mappings. Building on this structural property, we analyze the Hessian of the loss with respect to network activations and show that SimpleNorm significantly reduces the spectral norm of the Hessian, thereby permitting substantially larger SimpleGPT: Improving GPT via Simple Normalization Strategy stable learning rates. By grounding Transformer design in classical optimization principles (Nesterov, 1983; 1998; 2013), our framework provides unified explanation for existing stabilization techniques and offers principled guidance for building scalable and stable models. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We revisit Transformer optimization through the lens of second-order geometry and establish direct connection between architectural design, activation scale, the Hessian, and the maximum tolerable learning rate. We introduce SimpleGPT, new GPT architecture based on SimpleNorm, and theoretically show that this design significantly reduces Hxx2, yielding smaller Lipschitz gradient constant and enabling substantially larger stable learning rates. We demonstrate experimentally that these theoretical advantages are accompanied by consistent empirical gains across nanoGPT, LLaMA2, and LLaMA3 architectures, for model sizes ranging from 1B to 8B parameters. Specifically, when training 7B-scale models for 60K steps, our method achieves training loss that is 0.08 lower than that of LLaMA2 with QKNorm, reducing the loss from 2.290 to 2.208. 2. Related Work Normalization methods. Normalization has long been central tool for stabilizing optimization and improving convergence in deep networks. Batch Normalization (BN) (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) normalizes activations using mini-batch statistics and has been widely successful in convolutional architectures, but its behavior can depend on batch size and distributed synchronization. Layer Normalization (LN) (Ba et al., 2016) and its variants remove batch dependence by computing statistics across features within each sample and have become the standard in Transformers. Related methods such as Instance Normalization (IN) (Ulyanov et al., 2016), Group Normalization (GN) (Wu & He, 2018), RMSNorm (Zhang & Sennrich, 2019), and nGPT (Loshchilov et al., 2025) further tailor normalization to specific architectural or efficiency constraints.

SimpleNorm normalization strategy stabilizes activation scales and enables larger stable learning rates in Transformer models by reducing Hessian spectral norm, leading to improved training performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this work, we revisit Transformer optimization through the lens of second-order geometry and establish a direct connection between architectural design, activation scale, the Hessian matrix, and the maximum tolerable learning rate. We introduce a simple normalization strategy, termed SimpleNorm, which stabilizes intermediate activation scales by construction. Then, by analyzing the Hessian of the loss with respect to network activations, we theoretically show that SimpleNorm significantly reduces the spectral norm of the Hessian, thereby permitting larger stable learning rates. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on large GPT models at parameter scales 1B, 1.4B, 7B and 8B. Empirically, SimpleGPT, our SimpleNorm-based network, tolerates learning rates 3times-10times larger than standard convention, consistently demonstrates strong optimization stability, and achieves substantially better performance than well-established baselines. Specifically, when training 7B-scale models for 60K steps, SimpleGPT achieves a training loss that is 0.08 lower than that of LLaMA2 with QKNorm, reducing the loss from 2.290 to 2.208. Our source code will be released at https://github.com/Ocram7/SimpleGPT.

Авторы используют анализ геометрии второго порядка и показывают, что SimpleNorm снижает спектральную норму матрицы Гессиана функции потерь, что позволяет использовать значительно большие коэффициенты обучения. Экспериментальная валидация на больших GPT моделях (от 1B до 8B параметров) демонстрирует, что SimpleGPT стабилен при скоростях обучения в 3-10 раз выше стандартных значений. На практике модель достигает лучшей сходимости, чем базовые методы, снижая функцию потерь на 0.08 по сравнению с LLaMA2 при тренировке 7B модели.",
