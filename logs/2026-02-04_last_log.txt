Text:"MEG-XL: Data-Efficient Brain-to-Text via Long-Context Pre-Training Dulhan Jayalath Oiwi Parker Jones PNPL , University of Oxford {dulhan,oiwi}@robots.ox.ac.uk 6 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 4 9 4 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Figure 1. MEG-XL introduces long-context MEG pre-training. When fine-tuned, this approach generalises to decoding words in brain-to-text with less labelled subject data than required by the supervised state-of-the-art (SOTA) and brain foundation models (FMs). Abstract Clinical brain-to-text interfaces are designed for paralysed patients who cannot provide extensive training recordings. Pre-training improves dataefficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context. While natural speech might unfold gradually over minutes, most methods pretrain with only few seconds of context. Thus, we propose MEG-XL, model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300 longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Finetuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding. Our results indicate that long-context pre-training helps exploit extended neural context that other methods unnecessarily discard. Code, model weights, and instructions are available at https://github.com/ neural-processing-lab/MEG-XL. 1. Introduction Across modalities in deep learning, extending context has unlocked capabilities that short contexts could not provide. For example, task performance has improved by pre-training with longer, un-fragmented documents in language models (Dai et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and by including more task examples in context at inference time (Brown et al., 2020). In audio modelling, dilated convolutions have extended "

[ 1 0 2 3 3 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aMedical image segmentation is evolving from task-specific models toward generalizable frameworks. Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, these approaches often rely on single-turn, rigid interaction strategies and lack process-level supervision during training, which hinders their ability to fully exploit the dynamic potential of interactive tools and leads to redundant actions. To bridge this gap, we propose MedSAM-Agent, framework that reformulates interactive segmentation as multi-step autonomous decision-making process. First, we introduce hybrid prompting strategy for expertcurated trajectory generation, enabling the model to internalize human-like decision heuristics and adaptive refinement strategies. Furthermore, we develop two-stage training pipeline that integrates multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification with clinical-fidelity process reward design to promote interaction parsimony and decision efficiency. Extensive experiments across 6 medical modalities and 21 datasets demonstrate that MedSAM-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively unifying autonomous medical reasoning with robust, iterative optimization.

(a) SAM-based models (e.g., SAM, MedSAM) require continuous manual prompting via points or bounding boxes. (b) MLLMdriven models (e.g., LISA, UniBioMed) employs MLLM with specialized seg decoders and <seg> tokens. (c) Ours MedSAMAgent functions as an autonomous visual agent that performs multiturn refinement through iterative feedback and tool interaction, emulating the professional decision-making process. 1. Introduction Medical image segmentation stands as foundational task in clinical computer vision, underpinning critical applications such as early disease diagnosis, surgical planning, and treatment response assessment. Traditional AI-driven segmentation approaches, including UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) and its variants (Chen et al., 2021; Isensee et al., 2021; Li et al., 2025a; Zhou et al., 2018), have demonstrated impressive performance in medical segmentation scenarios. However, these methods are primarily tailored to specific tasks or imaging modalities, posing significant challenges when generalizing to new tasks that were not encountered during model training. The emergence of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) (Kirillov et al., 2023; Ravi et al., 2024) represented pivotal breakthrough, enabling high-quality segmentation through interactive human prompts (e.g., points, bounding boxes, or masks) (Ma et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2024b; Konwer et al., 2025; Ma et al., 2025b; Wu et al., 2025a; Gong et al., 2024). Nevertheless, MedSAM-Agent: Empowering Interactive Medical Image Segmentation with Multi-turn Agentic Reinforcement Learning these SAM-derived interactive models remain inherently dependent on expert prompting (Fig. 1a), which prevents them from achieving autonomous, generalized segmentation without manual intervention. Meanwhile, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) (Sellergren et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025b; Jiang et al., 2025a; Chen et al., 2024a) have shown remarkable perception and reasoning abilities in the medical domain, especially in visual question answering (Hu et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2021; Lau et al., 2018; He et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2025a) and report generation (Li et al., 2025b; Zambrano Chaves et al., 2025; Ma et al., 2025a; Chen et al., 2024b; Ru et al., 2026) tasks. While early attempts (Wu et al., 2025b; Huang et al., 2025b; Wang et al., 2025a) integrate MLLMs for segmentation via implicit tokens and additional pixel decoders (Fig. 1b), these methods often compromise semantic generalization by altering the original output space and shifting away from language-based outputs. Recent advancements (Li et al., 2024; Nath et al., 2025; Fathi et al., 2025) have shifted toward employing MLLMs as agents for invoking SAM tools, utilizing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) during the post-training stage to integrate the high-level reasoning of MLLMs with the robust interactive segmentation of SAM by internalizing the autonomous tool-using. However, existing methods still suffer from two major limitations: First, interaction strategies remain simplistic and inefficient. Current studies either rely on single-turn prompts (You & Wu, 2025; Liu et al., 2025b; Huang et al., 2025a; Li et al., 2024), treating SAM as static segmentor rather than an iterative agent, or adhere to rigid, point-only trajectories (Zhu et al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2026). These pointcentric paradigms lack the spatial flexibility to adaptively encompass morphological heterogeneity. In voluminous or ambiguously bounded cases, such methods fail to leverage bounding boxes as human-like anchor for global context, leading to suboptimal step-wise refinement and underutilized iterative potential. Second, the reinforcement learning process lacks process-level supervision. Existing RLVR frameworks (You & Wu, 2025; Huang et al., 2025a; Liu et al., 2025b; Jiang et al., 2025b; Liu et al., 2025c; Su et al., 2025a) focus predominantly on terminal outcomes, such as the final segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice or IoU), while neglecting the efficiency and logical coherence of intermediate actions. Without specific rewards to incentivize action parsimony and per-step effectiveness, the agent may take unnecessary steps that do not contribute to mask refinement, which ultimately compromises both training convergence efficiency and final inference performance. To address these limitations, we propose MedSAM-Agent, framework that enables MLLMs to emulate hum"

Stage-aware pruning method for large language and vision-language models that improves efficiency by selectively removing layers during different processing phases while maintaining accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, their deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. Existing structured pruning methods, while hardware-efficient, often suffer from significant accuracy degradation. In this paper, we argue that this failure stems from a stage-agnostic pruning approach that overlooks the asymmetric roles between the prefill and decode stages. By introducing a virtual gate mechanism, our importance analysis reveals that deep layers are critical for next-token prediction (decode) but largely redundant for context encoding (prefill). Leveraging this insight, we propose Prefill-Only Pruning (POP), a stage-aware inference strategy that safely omits deep layers during the computationally intensive prefill stage while retaining the full model for the sensitive decode stage. To enable the transition between stages, we introduce independent Key-Value (KV) projections to maintain cache integrity, and a boundary handling strategy to ensure the accuracy of the first generated token. Extensive experiments on Llama-3.1, Qwen3-VL, and Gemma-3 across diverse modalities demonstrate that POP achieves up to 1.37times speedup in prefill latency with minimal performance loss, effectively overcoming the accuracy-efficiency trade-off limitations of existing structured pruning methods.

AI-generated summary 				 Clinical brain-to-text interfaces are designed for paralysed patients who cannot provide extensive training recordings. Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context. While natural speech might unfold gradually over minutes, most methods pre-train with only a few seconds of context. Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding. Our results indicate that long-context pre-training helps exploit extended neural context that other methods unnecessarily discard.

HieraNav presents a multi-granularity, open-vocabulary navigation task with LangMap benchmark that enables agents to follow natural language instructions across different semantic levels in 3D environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 The relationships between objects and language are fundamental to meaningful communication between humans and AI, and to practically useful embodied intelligence. We introduce HieraNav, a multi-granularity, open-vocabulary goal navigation task where agents interpret natural language instructions to reach targets at four semantic levels: scene, room, region, and instance. To this end, we present Language as a Map (LangMap), a large-scale benchmark built on real-world 3D indoor scans with comprehensive human-verified annotations and tasks spanning these levels. LangMap provides region labels, discriminative region descriptions, discriminative instance descriptions covering 414 object categories, and over 18K navigation tasks. Each target features both concise and detailed descriptions, enabling evaluation across different instruction styles. LangMap achieves superior annotation quality, outperforming GOAT-Bench by 23.8% in discriminative accuracy using four times fewer words. Comprehensive evaluations of zero-shot and supervised models on LangMap reveal that richer context and memory improve success, while long-tailed, small, context-dependent, and distant goals, as well as multi-goal completion, remain challenging. HieraNav and LangMap establish a rigorous testbed for advancing language-driven embodied navigation. Project: https://bo-miao.github.io/LangMap

MedSAM-Agent reformulates medical image segmentation as a multi-step decision-making process using hybrid prompting and a two-stage training pipeline with process rewards to improve autonomous reasoning and optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Medical image segmentation is evolving from task-specific models toward generalizable frameworks. Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, these approaches often rely on single-turn, rigid interaction strategies and lack process-level supervision during training, which hinders their ability to fully exploit the dynamic potential of interactive tools and leads to redundant actions. To bridge this gap, we propose MedSAM-Agent, a framework that reformulates interactive segmentation as a multi-step autonomous decision-making process. First, we introduce a hybrid prompting strategy for expert-curated trajectory generation, enabling the model to internalize human-like decision heuristics and adaptive refinement strategies. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training pipeline that integrates multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification with a clinical-fidelity process reward design to promote interaction parsimony and decision efficiency. Extensive experiments across 6 medical modalities and 21 datasets demonstrate that MedSAM-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively unifying autonomous medical reasoning with robust, iterative optimization. Code is available https://github.com/CUHK-AIM-Group/MedSAM-Agent{here}.

"MedSAM-Agent reformulates medical image segmentation as a multi-step decision-making process using hybrid prompting and a two-stage training pipeline with process rewards to improve autonomous reasoning and optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Medical image segmentation is evolving from task-specific models toward generalizable frameworks. Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, these approaches often rely on single-turn, rigid interaction strategies and lack process-level supervision during training, which hinders their ability to fully exploit the dynamic potential of interactive tools and leads to redundant actions. To bridge this gap, we propose MedSAM-Agent, a framework that reformulates interactive segmentation as a multi-step autonomous decision-making process. First, we introduce a hybrid prompting strategy for expert-curated trajectory generation, enabling the model to internalize human-like decision heuristics and adaptive refinement strategies. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training pipeline that integrates multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification with a clinical-fidelity process reward design to promote interaction parsimony and decision efficiency. Extensive experiments across 6 medical modalities and 21 datasets demonstrate that MedSAM-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively unifying autonomous medical reasoning with robust, iterative optimization. Code is available https://github.com/CUHK-AIM-Group/MedSAM-Agent{here}."

Native position-independent caching enhances LLM inference efficiency by reintroducing encoders and developing a caching system that reduces latency while maintaining accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 The Key-Value (KV) cache of Large Language Models (LLMs) is prefix-based, making it highly inefficient for processing contexts retrieved in arbitrary order. Position-Independent Caching (PIC) has been proposed to enable KV reuse without positional constraints; however, existing approaches often incur substantial accuracy degradation, limiting their practical adoption. To address this issue, we propose native PIC by reintroducing the encoder to prevalent decoder-only LLMs and explicitly training it to support PIC. We further develop COMB, a PIC-aware caching system that integrates seamlessly with existing inference frameworks. Experimental results show that COMB reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 51-94% and increases throughput by 3times with comparable accuracy. Furthermore, the quality improvement when using DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat demonstrates the applicability of COMB to other types of decoder-only LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/shijuzhao/Comb.
