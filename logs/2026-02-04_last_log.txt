[ 1 5 0 4 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aImproving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) typically relies either on the models ability to sample correct solution to be reinforced or the existence of stronger model able to solve the problem. However, many difficult problems remain intractable for even current frontier models, preventing the extraction of valid training signals. promising alternative is to leverage high-quality expert human solutions, yet naive imitation of this data fails because it is fundamentally out-of-distribution: expert solutions are typically didactic, containing implicit reasoning gaps intended for human readers rather than computational models. Furthermore, high-quality expert solutions are expensive, necessitating generalizable sample-efficient training methods. We propose Distribution Aligned Imitation Learning (DAIL), two-step method that bridges the distributional gap by first transforming expert solutions into detailed, in-distribution reasoning traces and then applying contrastive objective to focus learning on expert insights and methodologies. We find that DAIL can leverage fewer than 1000 high-quality expert solutions to achieve 1025% pass@k gains on Qwen2.5-Instruct and Qwen3 models, improve reasoning efficiency by 2 to 4, and enable out-of-domain generalization. 1. Introduction Large reasoning models (LRMs) (Yang et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025; OpenAI, 2025; DeepMind, 2025) have recently demonstrated an impressive ability to solve extremely challenging tasks, from competition mathematics problems to graduate student exam questions (Rein et al., 2024). These models acquire this reasoning ability primarily through stage of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) (Shao et al., 2024), an online RL procedure where *Equal contribution Atlanta, Georgia. <emendes3@gatech.edu>. 1Georgia Institute of Technology, Ethan Mendes Correspondence to: Preprint. February 3, 2026. 1 models are rewarded based on the correctness of their final answer (ˆy = y) on large datasets of reasoning questions. However, during RLVR, problem contributes to learning only if the model can sample rollout that produces the correct answer. Paradoxically, on the most difficult problems, from which we would like them to learn the most, models often fail to extract any training signal as the rewards, advantages, and gradients are 0 (Nan et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025a;b). To bypass this exploration bottleneck, models could instead learn from high-quality human expert reasoning traces, such as those seen in recent evaluation benchmarks (Glazer et al., 2024; Phan et al., 2025). However, directly fine-tuning post-trained model on inputoutput pairs = {(xi, si)}n i=1 to imitate expert solutions leads to severe reasoning performance deterioration (Yang et al., 2026) . This degradation appears to arise because expert human targets are fundamentally out-of-distribution (OOD) from the models own reasoning process learned during post-training. Specifically, expert solutions are typically didactic; they prioritize human readability by omitting granular intermediate steps that, while implied for human reader, are essential for the model to reason successfully. Additionally, human solutions lack explicit search dynamics, such as backtracking and self-correction, that characterize some long chain-of-thought (CoT) LRM generations (Marjanovic et al., 2025) after training with RLVR. Consequently, standard behavioral cloning forces the model to shortcut its internal reasoning process acquired during post-training, collapsing performance. In this paper, we propose Distribution Aligned Imitation Learning (DAIL), novel post-training method that enables student model to learn directly from high-quality expert solutions to complex problems (see Figure 1). Because collecting this data requires domain experts and could cost upwards of $1,000 per sample (Chiou, 2025), is practically small. In this regime, we aim to maximally leverage each high-cost instance for generalizable reasoning improvement. DAIL bridges the mentioned distribution gap between expert solutions and students own reasoning process by transforming highly OOD expert solutions into learnable training examples. Specifically, we propose mixed policy rollout process where the student generates reasoning traces in tandem with privileged student, frozen instance of the model conditioned with the ground-truth solution. This Didactic to Constructive: Turning Expert Solutions into Learnable Reasoning Figure 1. Overview of DAIL. Starting from small set of expert solutions, we generate in-distribution transformed solutions for training via mixed policy decoding: the student model uses the expert solution as reference to produce detailed reasoning trace. This process mitigates didactic shortcuts, e.g., the expert solution skips the proof of why AOM is acute (in red), while the transformed solution explicitly details this reasoning (in green). Using this dataset of transformed solutions, DAIL applies contrastive learning on paired full vs. partial solutions to discourage imitating rationalization shortcuts in transformed solutions, e.g., the model ignoring the irrational part of derived result to force the generation of the correct answer (in orange). process expands the often non-comprehensive expert solution into detailed, in-distribution reasoning chain and fills in didactic shortcuts in the human-written solution, such as skipped steps and implied calculations. However, the cost of this distributional alignment is that generated traces may contain rationalization shortcuts or missing or insufficient justifications that lead to an intermediate result in the experts solution. As standard negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss enforces indiscriminate token-level imitation, it compels the student to internalize these harmful shortcuts. We find this naive mimicry ultimately degrades the students generalizable reasoning ability. Instead, we propose contrastive objective designed to prevent the student model from learning superficial reasoning. This objective penalizes mimicking negative reference conditioned solely on isolated intermediate results, enabling robust reasoning improvements. Building on findings (Zhou et al., 2023; Muennighoff et al., 2025) that fine-tuning on even limited number of highquali"

RANKVIDEO is a reasoning-based video retrieval system that improves upon traditional two-stage frameworks through explicit query-video pair analysis and a multi-objective training approach.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reranking is a critical component of modern retrieval systems, which typically pair an efficient first-stage retriever with a more expressive model to refine results. While large reasoning models have driven rapid progress in text-centric reranking, reasoning-based reranking for video retrieval remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce RANKVIDEO, a reasoning-based reranker for video retrieval that explicitly reasons over query-video pairs using video content to assess relevance. RANKVIDEO is trained using a two-stage curriculum consisting of perception-grounded supervised fine-tuning followed by reranking training that combines pointwise, pairwise, and teacher confidence distillation objectives, and is supported by a data synthesis pipeline for constructing reasoning-intensive query-video pairs. Experiments on the large-scale MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark demonstrate that RANKVIDEO consistently improves retrieval performance within a two-stage framework, yielding an average improvement of 31% on nDCG@10 and outperforming text-only and vision-language reranking alternatives, while more efficient.

LIVE is a long-horizon video world model that uses cycle-consistency and diffusion loss to control error accumulation during extended video generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autoregressive video world models predict future visual observations conditioned on actions. While effective over short horizons, these models often struggle with long-horizon generation, as small prediction errors accumulate over time. Prior methods alleviate this by introducing pre-trained teacher models and sequence-level distribution matching, which incur additional computational cost and fail to prevent error propagation beyond the training horizon. In this work, we propose LIVE, a Long-horizon Interactive Video world modEl that enforces bounded error accumulation via a novel cycle-consistency objective, thereby eliminating the need for teacher-based distillation. Specifically, LIVE first performs a forward rollout from ground-truth frames and then applies a reverse generation process to reconstruct the initial state. The diffusion loss is subsequently computed on the reconstructed terminal state, providing an explicit constraint on long-horizon error propagation. Moreover, we provide an unified view that encompasses different approaches and introduce progressive training curriculum to stabilize training. Experiments demonstrate that LIVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon benchmarks, generating stable, high-quality videos far beyond training rollout lengths.

"LIVE is a long-horizon video world model that uses cycle-consistency and diffusion loss to control error accumulation during extended video generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autoregressive video world models predict future visual observations conditioned on actions. While effective over short horizons, these models often struggle with long-horizon generation, as small prediction errors accumulate over time. Prior methods alleviate this by introducing pre-trained teacher models and sequence-level distribution matching, which incur additional computational cost and fail to prevent error propagation beyond the training horizon. In this work, we propose LIVE, a Long-horizon Interactive Video world modEl that enforces bounded error accumulation via a novel cycle-consistency objective, thereby eliminating the need for teacher-based distillation. Specifically, LIVE first performs a forward rollout from ground-truth frames and then applies a reverse generation process to reconstruct the initial state. The diffusion loss is subsequently computed on the reconstructed terminal state, providing an explicit constraint on long-horizon error propagation. Moreover, we provide an unified view that encompasses different approaches and introduce progressive training curriculum to stabilize training. Experiments demonstrate that LIVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon benchmarks, generating stable, high-quality videos far beyond training rollout lengths."

Distribution Aligned Imitation Learning (DAIL) improves LLM reasoning by transforming expert solutions into in-distribution traces and using contrastive learning to focus on expert methodologies, achieving significant performance gains with minimal expert data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) typically relies either on the model's ability to sample a correct solution to be reinforced or on the existence of a stronger model able to solve the problem. However, many difficult problems remain intractable for even current frontier models, preventing the extraction of valid training signals. A promising alternative is to leverage high-quality expert human solutions, yet naive imitation of this data fails because it is fundamentally out of distribution: expert solutions are typically didactic, containing implicit reasoning gaps intended for human readers rather than computational models. Furthermore, high-quality expert solutions are expensive, necessitating generalizable sample-efficient training methods. We propose Distribution Aligned Imitation Learning (DAIL), a two-step method that bridges the distributional gap by first transforming expert solutions into detailed, in-distribution reasoning traces and then applying a contrastive objective to focus learning on expert insights and methodologies. We find that DAIL can leverage fewer than 1000 high-quality expert solutions to achieve 10-25% pass@k gains on Qwen2.5-Instruct and Qwen3 models, improve reasoning efficiency by 2x to 4x, and enable out-of-domain generalization.
