Introduction 6 2 0 2 3 ] . [ 1 8 9 7 3 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Assisting non-expert users to develop complex interactive websites has become popular task for LLM-powered code agents. However, existing code agents tend to only generate frontend web pages, masking the lack of real full-stack data processing and storage with fancy visual effects. Notably, constructing production-level fullstack web applications is far more challenging than only generating frontend web pages, demanding careful control of data flow, comprehensive understanding of constantly updating packages and dependencies, and accurate localization of obscure bugs in the codebase. To address these difficulties, we introduce FullStack-Agent, unified agent system for full-stack agentic coding that consists of three parts: (1) FullStack-Dev, multi-agent framework with strong planning, code editing, codebase navigation, and bug localization abilities. (2) FullStack-Learn, an innovative data-scaling and self-improving method that back-translates crawled and synthesized website repositories to improve the backbone LLM of FullStack-Dev. (3) FullStack-Bench, comprehensive benchmark that systematically tests the frontend, backend and database functionalities of the generated website. Our FullStack-Dev outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% on the frontend, backend, and database test cases respectively. Additionally, FullStack-Learn raises the performance of 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8% on the three sets of test cases through self-improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

February 4, 2026. 1 Assisting non-expert users to develop complicated web applications based on natural language instructions has become popular task for Large Language Model (LLM)- powered (Qwen, 2025b; Wang et al., 2025). Various commercial products1 and research studies (Lu et al., 2025a; Wan et al., 2025) have provided solutions to this task through agentic coding, code execution, and GUI-agentbased testing. However, these systems tend to generate frontend-only websites even when backend and data storage are needed to fully support the functionality required by user instructions. They often mask the lack of real data flow with fancy visual effects to create an appearance of interactivity. For example, in one generated website, while form can be submitted and success notice appears, no data would actually be processed or stored due to the lack of backend and database implementation. Additionally, many of these methods generate only an HTML file (Xiao et al., 2025a; Si et al., 2025) or very simple codebase (Lu et al., 2025a), lacking scalability for production environments. However, full-stack websites are rather complicated, making it hard to design effective generation methods. There are at least three challenges in building code agents capable of generating production-grade full-stack websites: (1) Real-world web development frameworks, such as Next.js and NestJS, involve large, complex codebases, requiring efficient code navigation and accurate localization and correction of obscure errors. (2) The complicated workflow of full-stack coding demands long-term reasoning, skillful tool invocation, and expert mastery of web packagesareas in which current backbone LLMs still have considerable room for improvement. (3) Evaluating full-stack website generation remains challenging, as existing GUI-agent-based benchmarks such as WebGen-Bench (Lu et al., 2025b) primarily judge UI-level interactions and fail to detect missing or incorrect backend implementations. To address these challenges, we introduce FullStack-Agent, unified system for full-stack website generation that aims to close the gap between real-world web development and current agentic approaches. It jointly advances the effective1https://bolt.new, https://lovable.dev FullStack-Agent ness of full-stack development workflows, the agentic coding ability of backbone LLMs, and the comprehensiveness of website evaluation by proposing three tightly coupled components that work together to enable scalable and verifiable full-stack website construction. The three components, covering the agent framework, backbone LLM training, and full-stack evaluation, are detailed below: FullStack-Dev To effectively coordinate the complicated development workflow of full-stack website generation, we propose FullStack-Dev, multi-agent system that takes inspiration from real-world development processes. planning agent, serving as the lead architect, designs the structure of the full-stack website, and delegates frontend and backend plans to the corresponding coding agents. The two coding agents serve as frontend and backend engineers, and are equipped with efficient code editing, shell command execution, and website debugging tools, allowing them to dynamically control the coding process. In particular, the specially designed frontend and backend debugging tools can efficiently locate and correct subtle errors, greatly enhancing the coding agents development abilities. FullStack-Learn Even with powerful agent framework, the agentic coding skills and expert knowledge possessed by the backbone LLM are still crucial to the overall performance of the system. Therefore, we introduce FullStackLearn, data-scaling and model self-improvement method that generates high-quality agent trajectories through augmentation and back-translation of website repositories collected from GitHub. Our artful design combines global planning and information gathering with local code implementation, effectively solving the non-trivial problem of converting complicated repository into agent trajectories that implement it from scratch. These agent trajectories, generated from real-world codebases and used for supervised fine-tuning, enable the LLMs to learn valuable agentic coding abilities and expert understanding of website development frameworks.

A unified agent system called FullStack-Agent is introduced to assist non-expert users in developing complex interactive websites by addressing full-stack development challenges through enhanced planning, code editing, and self-improving capabilities.  					AI-generated summary 				 Assisting non-expert users to develop complex interactive websites has become a popular task for LLM-powered code agents. However, existing code agents tend to only generate frontend web pages, masking the lack of real full-stack data processing and storage with fancy visual effects. Notably, constructing production-level full-stack web applications is far more challenging than only generating frontend web pages, demanding careful control of data flow, comprehensive understanding of constantly updating packages and dependencies, and accurate localization of obscure bugs in the codebase. To address these difficulties, we introduce FullStack-Agent, a unified agent system for full-stack agentic coding that consists of three parts: (1) FullStack-Dev, a multi-agent framework with strong planning, code editing, codebase navigation, and bug localization abilities. (2) FullStack-Learn, an innovative data-scaling and self-improving method that back-translates crawled and synthesized website repositories to improve the backbone LLM of FullStack-Dev. (3) FullStack-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically tests the frontend, backend and database functionalities of the generated website. Our FullStack-Dev outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% on the frontend, backend, and database test cases respectively. Additionally, FullStack-Learn raises the performance of a 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8% on the three sets of test cases through self-improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The code is released at https://github.com/mnluzimu/FullStack-Agent.

Our FullStack-Dev outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% on the frontend, backend, and database test cases respectively. Additionally, FullStack-Learn raises the performance of a 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8% on the three sets of test cases through self-improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The code is released at https://github.com/mnluzimu/FullStack-Agent."

['OPTIMIZATION', 'SYNTHETIC', 'OPEN_SOURCE']
```

**Justification:**

1. **OPTIMIZATION**: The paper discusses enhancing training and performance through FullStack-Learn, a "data-scaling and self-improving method" that improves the backbone LLM, which relates to training optimization methods.

2. **SYNTHETIC**: The paper explicitly mentions "synthesized website repositories" used to improve the model, which falls under generating and leveraging artificial data for training.

3. **OPEN_SOURCE**: The paper states "The code is released at https://github.com/mnluzimu/FullStack-Agent," indicating the authors are contributing code to open-source projects.
