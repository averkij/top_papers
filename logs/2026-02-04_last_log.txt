Text:"FIRE-Bench: Evaluating Agents on the Rediscovery of Scientific Insights Zhen Wang 1 * Fan Bai 2 * Zhongyan Luo 1 * Jinyan Su 3 Kaiser Sun 2 Xinle Yu 1 Jieyuan Liu 1 Kun Zhou 1 Claire Cardie 3 Mark Dredze 2 Eric P. Xing 4 5 Zhiting Hu 1 Website: https://firebench.github.io 6 2 0 2 2 ] A . [ 1 5 0 9 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate scientific discovery end-to-end, but rigorously evaluating their capacity for verifiable discovery remains central challenge. Existing benchmarks face trade-off: they either heavily rely on LLM-asjudge evaluations of automatically generated research outputs or optimize convenient yet isolated performance metrics that provide coarse proxies for scientific insight. To address this gap, we introduce FIRE-BENCH (Full-cycle Insight Rediscovery Evaluation), benchmark that evaluates agents through the rediscovery of established findings from recent, high-impact machine learning research. Agents are given only highlevel research question extracted from published, verified study and must autonomously explore ideas, design experiments, implement code, execute their plans, and derive conclusions supported by empirical evidence. We evaluate range of state-of-the-art agents with frontier LLMs backbones like gpt-5 on FIRE-BENCH. Our results show that full-cycle scientific research remains challenging for current agent systems: even the strongest agents achieve limited rediscovery success (<50 F1), exhibit high variance across runs, and display recurring failure modes in experimental design, execution, and evidence-based reasoning. FIRE-BENCH provides rigorous and diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward reliable agent-driven scientific discovery. 1.

Researchers developed FIRE-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation framework that challenges autonomous agents to rediscover established scientific findings through complete research cycles involving hypothesis generation, experimentation, coding, and evidence-based conclusion drawing.  					AI-generated summary 				 Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate scientific discovery end-to-end, but rigorously evaluating their capacity for verifiable discovery remains a central challenge. Existing benchmarks face a trade-off: they either heavily rely on LLM-as-judge evaluations of automatically generated research outputs or optimize convenient yet isolated performance metrics that provide coarse proxies for scientific insight. To address this gap, we introduce FIRE-Bench (Full-cycle Insight Rediscovery Evaluation), a benchmark that evaluates agents through the rediscovery of established findings from recent, high-impact machine learning research. Agents are given only a high-level research question extracted from a published, verified study and must autonomously explore ideas, design experiments, implement code, execute their plans, and derive conclusions supported by empirical evidence. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agents with frontier LLMs backbones like gpt-5 on FIRE-Bench. Our results show that full-cycle scientific research remains challenging for current agent systems: even the strongest agents achieve limited rediscovery success (<50 F1), exhibit high variance across runs, and display recurring failure modes in experimental design, execution, and evidence-based reasoning. FIRE-Bench provides a rigorous and diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward reliable agent-driven scientific discovery.

A large-scale synthetic dataset called Privasis is introduced to address privacy concerns in AI research, enabling more effective text sanitization with compact models that outperform existing large language models.  					AI-generated summary 				 Research involving privacy-sensitive data has always been constrained by data scarcity, standing in sharp contrast to other areas that have benefited from data scaling. This challenge is becoming increasingly urgent as modern AI agents--such as OpenClaw and Gemini Agent--are granted persistent access to highly sensitive personal information. To tackle this longstanding bottleneck and the rising risks, we present Privasis (i.e., privacy oasis), the first million-scale fully synthetic dataset entirely built from scratch--an expansive reservoir of texts with rich and diverse private information--designed to broaden and accelerate research in areas where processing sensitive social data is inevitable. Compared to existing datasets, Privasis, comprising 1.4 million records, offers orders-of-magnitude larger scale with quality, and far greater diversity across various document types, including medical history, legal documents, financial records, calendars, and text messages with a total of 55.1 million annotated attributes such as ethnicity, date of birth, workplace, etc. We leverage Privasis to construct a parallel corpus for text sanitization with our pipeline that decomposes texts and applies targeted sanitization. Our compact sanitization models (<=4B) trained on this dataset outperform state-of-the-art large language models, such as GPT-5 and Qwen-3 235B. We plan to release data, models, and code to accelerate future research on privacy-sensitive domains and agents.
