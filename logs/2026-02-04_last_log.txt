[ 1 0 3 6 1 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aWorld models have emerged as critical frontier in AI research, aiming to enhance large models by infusing them with physical dynamics and world knowledge. The core objective is to enable agents to understand, predict, and interact with complex environments. However, current research landscape remains fragmented, with approaches predominantly focused on injecting world knowledge into isolated tasks, such as visual prediction, 3D estimation, or symbol grounding, rather than establishing unified definition or framework. While these task-specific integrations yield performance gains, they often lack the systematic coherence required for holistic world understanding. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of such fragmented approaches and propose unified design specification for world models. We suggest that robust world model should not be loose collection of capabilities but normative framework that integrally incorporates interaction, perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial representation. This work aims to provide structured perspective to guide future research toward more general, robust, and principled models of the world. 1.

February 3, 2026. large models (Achiam et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2025a; Liu et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2025a; Chen et al., 2024b; Team et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024) and diffusion models (Liu et al., 2022; Lipman et al., 2022; Labs, 2024; Peebles & Xie, 2023) have achieved remarkable results in various fields. However, as model performance further improves, the bottleneck in data quality has become increasingly difficult to overcome, hindering further progress, especially in multimodal domains requiring precise analysis, such as multimodal reasoning, chemical formula recognition, 3D scene generation, and specific professional areas like healthcare (Tang et al., 2024; 2025a; Tochilkin et al., 2024; Xiang et al., 2025b;a; Cheng et al., 2025). To break through the traditional token-prediction paradigm of large models, researchers have begun to focus on the study of world models. The concept of World Model was first introduced by (Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018), which proposed strategy of constructing an interactive system between agents and the world to handle complex visual input environments. With the rapid development of large models and various multimodal generation methods, recent work (Zhu et al., 2024) has further expanded the notion of world models, viewing video generation and 3D generation as intelligent systems that simulate the real world. Researchers are considering world models as the next-generation paradigm to replace token-predicting large language models (Yang et al., 2025c). As world models attract growing interest, numerous research fields have begun to incorporate world knowledge to empower models to perform tasks that require an understanding of physical and contextual rules (Yu et al., 2025a; Team et al., 2025b; Liu et al., 2025c; Zhu et al., 2025). This trend is evident in diverse applications, including image editing (Zeng et al., 2025a; Lin et al., 2025a; Chen et al., 2025c), multimodal spatial reasoning (Chen et al., 2024a), autonomous driving (Tu et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2025b), and even mobile communication methods such as MobileWorld (Kong et al., 2025). Several studies (Hu et al., 2025) have further provided systematic categorizations and summaries of Research on World Models Is Not Merely Injecting World Knowledge into Specific Tasks advocates for shift from task-specific adaptations to comprehensive system design. Specifically, the main contents and contributions of this work are organized as follows: We provide detailed review of recent progress in World Models, categorizing existing approaches into reasoning, content generation, and interactive agents. We examine how these fields currently incorporate world knowledge to enhance performance. We critically analyze the shortcomings of current methods that rely on injecting knowledge into isolated tasks. Through case studies in LLMs, video generation, and embodied AI, we demonstrate that these approaches often fail to achieve genuine physical understanding and long-term consistency. We propose unified and standardized World Model Framework. We define the essential components, including Interaction, Reasoning, Memory, Environment, and Multimodal Generation, and articulate how they should be integrally designed to support robust world simulation. We identify critical directions for future breakthroughs, such as physically-grounded spatiotemporal representation, embodied interaction control, and autonomous modular evolution, to guide the community toward more general and principled models. 2. Background Understanding world knowledge is crucial for enhancing the ability of artificial intelligence systems to handle complex physical environments. Existing research can be broadly categorized into three classes based on the proactivity of their interaction with the environment and their approach to knowledge integration. Although these methods have made progress in their respective fields, they collectively highlight an urgent need for unified and proactive world modeling framework in current research. 2.1. Reasoning with World Knowledge First, since Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models (LLM/VLM) have demonstrated powerful reasoning and generalization capabilities, some studies have built upon this foundation to further enhance models reasoning abilities concerning complex physical worlds and challenging logical concepts. This category of work primarily includes: general multimodal reasoning represented by"

Accordingly, rubric-based evaluation has become common practice. However, existing approaches either rely on coarse, pre-defined rubrics that lack sufficient granularity, or depend on manually constructed query-specific rubrics that are costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose pipeline to train human-preference-aligned query-specific rubric generators tailored for DeepResearch report generation. We first construct dataset of DeepResearch-style queries annotated with human preferences over paired reports, and train rubric generators via reinforcement learning with hybrid reward combining human preference supervision and LLM-based rubric evaluation. To better handle long-horizon reasoning, we further introduce Multi-agent Markov-state (MaMs) workflow for report generation. We empirically show that our proposed rubric generators deliver more discriminative and better human-aligned supervision than existing rubric design strategies. Moreover, when integrated into the MaMs training framework, DeepResearch systems equipped with our rubric generators consistently outperform all open-source baselines on the DeepResearch Bench and achieve performance comparable to that of leading closed-source models. 1.

Unlike short-form DeepResearch tasks like BrowseComp (Wei et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025), GAIA (Mialon et al., 2023), and HLE (Phan et al., 2025), report generation requires models to reason, retrieve, and integrate over diverse sources and multiple turns, while presenting results in coherent and well-structured manner. However, training and evaluating DeepResearch report generators remain fundamentally challenging. key difficulty lies in the absence of verifiable rewards. Human evaluation, while reliable, is costly and difficult to scale (Krishna et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2023; Shao et al., 2025b), motivating the widespread adoption of rubric-based evaluation (Gunjal et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025; Viswanathan et al., 2025) as practical alternative. In principle, expert-designed, queryspecific rubrics, like ResearchRubrics (Sharma et al., 2025), could serve as faithful proxy for human judgments when evaluating DeepResearch reports. However, authoring such rubrics requires substantial domain expertise and effort for each query, making this approach difficult to scale to large and diverse training corpora. Prior work has explored pre-defined generic rubrics (Que et al., 2024; Hashemi et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024a) or LLM-generated query-specific rubrics (Xie et al., 2025; Du et al., 2025) to provide structured feedback for report generation tasks. However, those methods suffer from two limitations: First, pre-defined rubrics are necessarily generic and lack the granularity needed to distinguish subtle quality differences across diverse research queries. Second, LLMgenerated query-specific rubrics are typically not grounded in human preference data, making them prone to misalignment with how humans actually compare and judge research reports. These issues may lead to weak supervision signals, reward hacking, and inefficient learning dynamics. To address these limitations, it is crucial to reconsider the source of supervision for evaluating DeepResearch reports. We argue that one of the most direct supervision signals for assessing report quality is human preference (Dai Learning Query-Specific Rubrics from Human Preferences for DeepResearch Report Generation et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2024a; Liu et al., 2024b) over candidate reports. Given these limitations, natural question arises: rather than applying generic or human-annotated rubrics, can we learn to evaluate reports in way that is both scalable on large training data and aligned with human preferences? In this paper, we propose pipeline to effectively train human-preference-aligned query-specific rubric generators tailored for DeepResearch report generation. We construct preference dataset of over 5, 000 DeepResearch-style queries, each paired with two candidate reports and annotated with human preference judgments. Then we train the rubric generator using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024b) with hybrid reward that integrates two complementary signals. The first component is the preference consistency reward, which encourages the generated rubric to be discriminative by correctly ranking human-preferred reports above less-preferred ones, using the annotated preference dataset to guide scoring. For the second reward, we leverage LLMs to assess rubric quality, providing feedback on whether the generated criteria are coherent, applicable, and discriminative. Once trained, the rubric generator is integrated into the training of DeepResearch systems. For each input query, it automatically produces query-level rubrics that are used to evaluate rollout samples from the policy model, assigning fine-grained reward scores that guide the optimization process. Whats more, to address the long-context dependencies in the ReAct workflow (Yao et al., 2022), we further propose the Multi-agent Markov-state (MaMs) workflow. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed rubric generators deliver more discriminative and human-aligned supervision signals than pre-defined or LLM-generated alternatives. Furthermore, when employed as training signals for DeepResearch agents, these generated rubrics consistently enhance performance across m"

Existing efficiency methods primarily rely on local, per-trajectory signals and lack principled mechanisms to exploit global dynamics across parallel branches. We introduce 2D probing, an interface that exposes the widthdepth dynamics of parallel thinking by periodically eliciting intermediate answers from all branches. Our analysis reveals three key insights: non-monotonic scaling across widthdepth allocations, heterogeneous reasoning branch lengths, and early stabilization of global consensus. Guided by these insights, we introduce Parallel-Probe, training-free controller designed to optimize online parallel thinking. Parallel-Probe employs consensus-based early stopping to regulate reasoning depth and deviation-based branch pruning to dynamically adjust width. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and multiple models demonstrate that Parallel-Probe establishes superior Pareto frontier for test-time scaling. Compared to standard majority voting, it reduces sequential tokens by up to 35.8% and total token cost by over 25.8% while maintaining competitive accuracy. 6 2 0 2 3 ] .

By maintaining multiple candidate reasoning trajectories, it reduces the brittleness of single-chain reasoning, where early mistakes can easily compromise the entire reasoning process (Wang et al., 2022a; Zheng et al., 2025). Moreover, parallel thinking is also hardware-friendly: it naturally aligns with modern GPU parallelism, enabling high-throughput batched decoding (Rodionov et al., 2025; Hsu et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025c). However, this paradigm often requires massive token generation (Fu et al., 2025b), e.g., token usage nearly scales with the number of parallel branches, thereby posing significant challenges to efficiency. To improve efficiency, previous work studies efficient reasoning at test time. The majority of the research investigates early-stopping strategies for sequential generation (e.g., extended Chain-of-Thought), leveraging signals such as confidence (Fu et al., 2025b), hidden states (Li et al., 2026), or answer convergence (Liu & Wang, 2025; Zhang et al., 2025b). Since these approaches focus on the internal state of individual trajectories, they ignore critical global information across branches (e.g., consensus), making them sub-optimal in parallel thinking settings. Meanwhile, several studies have explored adaptive sampling to reduce the inference cost of self-consistency (Mao et al., 2025; Aggarwal et al., 2023; Wan et al., 2025; Fu et al., 2025b; Huang et al., 2025). Since these methods rely on sequential control loops, they transform parallel sampling into semi-sequential process. Consequently, even though sample efficiency is improved, the increased latency cancels out the speed advantage. Efficient parallel thinking in an online setting has received limited attention, particularly the simultaneous launch of multiple paths. The fundamental challenge lies the intrinsic independence of parallel decoding threads, where each branch evolves without regard for the progression of others. This isolation leads to suboptimal resource allocation and decoding of redundant trajectories. This raises pivotal question: Can we introduce lightweight global signals to facilitate efficient, hardware-friendly parallel thinking? To bridge this gap, we introduce 2D Probing, black-box Parallel-Probe: Towards Efficient Parallel Thinking via 2D Probing Figure 1. Overview of the Parallel-Probe framework. It monitors parallel reasoning branches via continuous 2D probing. (1) Divergence Pruning: Outlying trajectories that drift from the global majority (e.g., Branch 4) are aggressively pruned to save compute. (2) Stability Stopping: The global controller halts the entire ensemble once the consensus stabilizes, preventing the execution of redundant post-convergence steps (dashed area). Crucially, Parallel-Probe is model-agnostic and compatible with various off-the-shelf LLMs. We evaluate Performance, Cost Efficiency, and Latency Efficiency across 0.6B and 1.7B models. Values are averaged across all datasets and normalized such that the best-performing method on each axis equals 1.0. Parallel-Probe (blue) achieves the largest coverage area, demonstrating superior balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency compared to SC and ESC methods. interface that periodically injects an end-of-think token to elicit intermediate answers from each branch during decoding. This constructs 2D probing matrix with intermediate answers, defined by branch index (width) and probing period (depth). Such probing matrix enables fine-grained monitoring of reasoning trajectories. To analyze these dynamics, we develop SCOUT (Sequential & Concurrent Offline Utilization Testbed), an evaluation platform designed to rapidly assess different strategies using pre-sampled data. Using SCOUT, we discover three simple but important insights that explain why standard per-trajectory early stopping is suboptimal for online parallel thinking: (i) Scaling is non-monotonic: Accuracy depends heavily on how width and depth are balanced, not just the total token budget (Figure 2 (a)); (ii) Lengths of reasoning branches are highly uneven (Figure 2 (b) and Figure 7). (iii) Consensus stabilizes early: Early majority votes are often unstable and inaccurate, but they converge to reliable consensus long before all branches terminate (Figure 2 (c)).

[ 1 6 3 6 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aSearch intelligence is evolving from Deep Research to Wide Research, paradigm essential for retrieving and synthesizing comprehensive information under complex constraints in parallel. However, progress in this field is impeded by the lack of dedicated benchmarks and optimization methodologies for search breadth. To address these challenges, we take deep dive into Wide Research from two perspectives: Data Pipeline and Agent Optimization. First, we produce WideSeekBench, General Broad Information Seeking (GBIS) benchmark constructed via rigorous multi-phase data pipeline to ensure diversity across the target information volume, logical constraints, and domains. Second, we introduce WideSeek, dynamic hierarchical multi-agent architecture that can autonomously fork parallel sub-agents based on task requirements. Furthermore, we design unified training framework that linearizes multi-agent trajectories and optimizes the system using end-to-end RL. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of WideSeek and multi-agent RL, highlighting that scaling the number of agents is promising direction for advancing the Wide Research paradigm. 1. Introduction Search Intelligence constitutes the cornerstone of Agentic AI (Shi et al., 2025; Abou Ali et al., 2025). Moving beyond mere substitute for conventional search engines, it serves as an essential module for complex, real-world applications, including repository-level code generation (Jimenez et al., 2024), enterprise data intelligence (Lei et al., 2025), and Equal contribution. 1Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences 2University of Chinese Academy of Sciences 3University of Science and Technology of China. Corresponding author: Kang Liu . Preprint. Emali: huangzy0312@gmail.com 1 Figure 1. Deep Research paradigm vs. Wide Research paradigm. general GUI manipulation (Xie et al., 2024). Existing research has predominantly focused on Deep Research (Wei et al., 2025), which employs complex, multistep reasoning and action sequences to locate single hard-to-find piece of information. As AI enters its Second Half (Yao, 2025), the research community is increasingly shifting its focus toward real-world and utility scenarios. This transition necessitates move toward Wide Research (Manus, 2025), as shown in Figure 1, which replaces sequential reasoning with parallel orchestration paradigm. By prioritizing high-breadth synthesis and structural comprehensiveness, Wide Research enhances productivity and scales the effectiveness of industrial AI deployment. Wide Research focuses on systematic retrieval across expansive search spaces, transitioning from deep-but-narrow chains to high-breadth parallelized frameworks. Aligning with Kimi Agent-Swarm (Moonshot AI, 2026), this WideSeek: Advancing Wide Research via Multi-Agent Scaling paradigm employs sophisticated orchestrator to decompose complex global objectives into granular, parallel subtasks, which are then concurrently executed by autonomous agents capable of iterative deep research and mutual crossvalidation. representative application is the generation of Competitor Analysis Tables, as exemplified by systems such as Manus (Manus, 2025), which synthesize information from thousands of sources into comprehensive comparative tables, substantially reducing labor costs of Human Data Analyst while enhancing productivity at scale. Despite its promise, the advancement of Wide Research is hindered by three primary challenges: (1) Limitations in Benchmarks: Existing benchmarks (Wong et al., 2025; Lan et al., 2025) are largely constructed by human experts, which limits their scale, diversity, and categorization depth. Furthermore, they typically provide only test sets, lacking the training data necessary for model optimization; (2) Deficiencies in Data Synthesis: Current data synthesis methods for search agents focus on sampling complex graph topologies to simulate multi-step reasoning paths (Li et al., 2025; Tao et al., 2025). While these approaches effectively optimize for search depth, they lack the capacity to efficiently synthesize large scale of atomic information under complex constraint, which is critical for search width; and (3) Optimization Gaps: Previous approaches often rely on closed-source models within static multi-agent frameworks (Roucher et al., 2025), or concentrates on enhancing the depth of single-agent reasoning (Lu et al., 2025). There is notable lack of exploration into the end-to-end optimization of systems capable of autonomously broadening their search paths. To address these challenges, we investigate the Wide Research paradigm through two perspectives: data pipeline construction and agent optimization. Data Pipeline & Benchmark. While conventional methods construct information graphs from web pages to emulate reasoning paths toward single answer, our approach utilizes large-scale Knowledge Graphs (KGs) (Schmelzeisen et al., 2021) to extract clusters of interconnected world knowledge. Specifically, we initialize the process with seed entities and set of sampled seed constraints. By applying formal set operations (including intersection, union, and difference), we construct complex constraints that resolve into target entity set. Simultaneously, we sample high-coverage attributes of these entities to define the target attribute set. Next, we fetch all atomic information from Knowledge Graph to form the answer table and construct the input task based on the complex constraints. For convenient evaluation, this pipeline produces column-wise rubrics for reward system. To ensure the quality of data, all tasks will be evaluated by hybrid filtering system. Based on this pipeline, we introduce WideSeekBench, benchmark for General Broad Information Seeking (GBIS) comprising both training and test sets. To ensure rigorous and multi-dimensional evaluation, the test set is strictly sampled and balanced across target information volume, operator complexity, and domains. Agent Optimization. The Wide Research paradigm requires agents to acquire and synthesize target information from large volume of sources. This necessitates reasoning architecture that supports both parallel and serial execution, typically involving ultra-long-"

[ 1 3 0 1 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aThis work stems from prior complementary observations on the dynamics of Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Large Language Models (LLMs) is shown latent planning of subsequent reasoning prior to CoT emergence, thereby diminishing the significance of explicit CoT; whereas CoT remains critical for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To deepen the understanding between LLMs internal states and its verbalized reasoning trajectories, we investigate the latent planning strength of LLMs, through our probing method, Tele-Lens, applying to hidden states across diverse task domains. Our empirical results indicate that LLMs exhibit myopic horizon, primarily conducting incremental transitions without precise global planning. Leveraging this characteristic, we propose hypothesis on enhancing uncertainty estimation of CoT, which we validate that small subset of CoT positions can effectively represent the uncertainty of the entire path. We further underscore the significance of exploiting CoT dynamics, and demonstrate that automatic recognition of CoT bypass can be achieved without performance degradation. Our code, data and models are released at https: //github.com/lxucs/tele-lens. 1. Introduction Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Nye et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022) has fundamentally reshaped problem-solving in natural language processing, marking shift from traditional patternmatching approaches, e.g. encoder-based classification (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019), toward prompt-based reasoning articulated explicitly in natural language (Zhou et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2024; Sahoo et al., 2025). The capacity of CoT is further amplified through extensive thinking emanated from reinforcement learning, characterized by recent models such as DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025). 1WeChat AI, Tencent Inc. (cid:66): <liyanlxu@tencent.com> Preprint. February 3, 2026. While CoT is widely perceived as the de facto reasoning paradigm, however, recent studies on Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed complementary, and at times seemingly conflicting perspectives. On the one hand, LLMs have been shown to exhibit internal planning on the reasoning trace prior to the explicit emergence of CoT. Dong et al. (2025) observes that hidden states at the beginning of CoT can reliably predict the total reasoning steps and key attributes with high correlation to the realized trajectories. Similarly, other studies also suggest that earlier hidden states already carry the information of subsequent generation (Pal et al., 2023), to the extent where the initial stages of CoT effectively plan the final answers (Azaria & Mitchell, 2023; Gottesman & Geva, 2024; Afzal et al., 2025). The internal planning capabilities of LLMs appear to diminish the necessity of CoT, raising the question of whether the thinking process is just echoing pre-determined paths already encoded in the prior internal states. On the other hand, theoretical analyses state that CoT is indispensable due to the limited expressivity of Transformers bounded by its architectures (Bhattamishra et al., 2023; Merrill & Sabharwal, 2023; Li et al., 2024), and only intermediate steps of CoT can derive length generalization (Anil et al., 2022; Xiao & Liu, 2025) and compositional reasoning (Wies et al., 2023; Abbe et al., 2024; Zubic et al., 2025). Therefore, the manifestation of pre-calculated trajectories appear unlikely via internal planning before the onset of CoT. Nonetheless, the relationship between the models internal representations and its verbalized reasoning tokens largely remains opaque. In this work, we investigate the internal dynamics of CoT, and target the following questions concerning the latent planning horizon: To what extent do hidden states encode global plan for the reasoning roadmap, as opposed to supporting rather local, incremental state transitions? And how does the scope of planning horizon further imply other CoT characteristics? Towards this objective, we derive empirical insights by examining the synergy between explicit CoT steps and its latent planning horizon. Building on the observations, we then highlight the significance of leveraging CoT dynamics No Global Plan in Chain-of-Thought: Uncover the Latent Planning Horizon of LLMs on estimating CoTs uncertainty and necessity. To answer the first question, Section 2 presents series of probing experiments designed for dissecting LLM hidden states, aiming to evaluate the internal planning strengths with respect to future reasoning trajectories. We first introduce our probing method, termed Tele-Lens, which employs trained low-rank adapter (Houlsby et al., 2019) that transforms each hidden state within CoT steps to predict Teleological information along multiple dimensions, including subsequent tokens, final answers, reasoning lengths, etc. Importantly, unlike prior works that primarily address singledomain tasks, we conduct probing experiments across 12 diverse datasets spanning different classes and domains, ranging from straightforward knowledge question answering to classic hard problems, e.g. Parity (counting the number of digits as even or odd), canonical challenge for Transformers (Chiang & Cholak, 2022; Hahn & Rofin, 2024). By empirical results, we observe sharply contrasting behaviors across probing dimensions and task domains, as detailed in Section 2.5. For instance, in terms of probing subsequent reasoning paths, hidden states can be indeed predictive on tasks with more structured solutions, such as algorithmic tasks, but they generally fail to predict on tasks with natural language tone, such as document comprehension. In terms of predicting final answers, hidden states exhibit limited planning horizon; for compositional tasks especially, they can only reliably capture the precise answer only one or two steps away from the reasoning completion. Interestingly, at the early stage of CoT, our results suggest that hidden states can encode predictive signals of the final answer for easier problems, reflecting coarse answer gist, which echos prior observations (Gottesman & Geva, 2024; Afzal et al., 2025). However, for harder tasks requiring explicit multi-step, the initial prediction drops to near-flat. Overall, our probing results bring unified view of the prior complementary beliefs from previous works: LLMs exhibit myopic pla"

Text:"Decouple Searching from Training: Scaling Data Mixing via Model Merging for Large Language Model Pre-training Shengrui Li 1 Fei Zhao 1 Kaiyan Zhao 1 Jieying Ye 1 Haifeng Liu 1 Fangcheng Shi 1 Zheyong Xie 1 Yao Hu 1 Shaosheng Cao 1 6 2 0 2 1 3 ] . [ 1 7 4 7 0 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract Determining an effective data mixture is key factor in Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training, where models must balance general competence with proficiency on hard tasks such as math and code. However, identifying an optimal mixture remains an open challenge, as existing approaches either rely on unreliable tiny-scale proxy experiments or require prohibitively expensive largescale exploration. To address this, we propose Decouple Searching from Training Mix (DeMix), novel framework that leverages model merging to predict optimal data ratios. Instead of training proxy models for every sampled mixture, DeMix trains component models on candidate datasets at scale and derives data mixture proxies via weighted model merging. This paradigm decouples search from training costs, enabling evaluation of unlimited sampled mixtures without extra training burden and thus facilitating better mixture discovery through more search trials. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMix breaks the trade-off between sufficiency, accuracy and efficiency, obtaining the optimal mixture with higher benchmark performance at lower search cost. Additionally, we release the DeMix Corpora, comprehensive 22T-token dataset comprising high-quality pre-training data with validated mixtures to facilitate open research. Our code and DeMix Corpora is available at https: //github.com/Lucius-lsr/DeMix. 1.

[ 1 2 6 3 1 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aIn discrete generative modeling, two dominant paradigms demonstrate divergent capabilities: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLM) excel at semantic understanding and zero-shot generalization, whereas Uniform-noise Diffusion Language Models (UDLM) achieve strong fewstep generation quality, yet neither attains balanced performance across both dimensions. To address this, we propose XDLM, which bridges the two paradigms via stationary noise kernel. XDLM offers two key contributions: (1) it provides principled theoretical unification of MDLM and UDLM, recovering each paradigm as special case; and (2) an alleviated memory bottleneck enabled by an algebraic simplification of the posterior probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that XDLM advances the Pareto frontier between understanding capability and generation quality. Quantitatively, XDLM surpasses UDLM by 5.4 points on zero-shot text benchmarks and outperforms MDLM in few-step image generation (FID 54.1 vs. 80.8). When scaled to tune an 8B-parameter large language model, XDLM achieves 15.0 MBPP in just 32 steps, effectively doubling the baseline performance. Finally, analysis of training dynamics reveals XDLMs superior potential for long-term scaling. Code is available at this http URL. 1. Introduction Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in continuous domains, particularly in image and audio generation (Ho et al., 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Rombach et al., 2022; Kong et al., 2020). Inspired by this potential, Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (D3PM) has emerged as promising paradigm shift to the discrete state space (Austin et al., 2021). Notably, these Discrete 1UCAS 2Xiaohongshu Inc.. Yunfan <caoshaosheng@xiaohongshu.com>. <liuyunfan@ucas.ac.cn>, Liu Preprint. February 3, 2026. Correspondence to: Shaosheng Cao Diffusion Models (DDMs) are now demonstrating strong performance in language modeling, field long dominated by auto-regressive (AR) architectures. Within this landscape, DDM studies have diverged into two distinct branches: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) (Sahoo et al., 2024) and Uniform-noise Diffusion Language Models (UDLMs) (Schiff et al., 2024). While MDLMs achieve superior performance in likelihood modeling and zero-shot generalization, they often struggle to generate coherent, contextually consistent outputs with limited inference steps. Conversely, UDLMs excel at low-step generation but frequently lag behind MDLMs when the number of inference steps increases. Despite their individual merits, neither achieves balanced performance across these dimensions. This imbalance carries significant practical implications. In domains like image synthesis, the required inference steps are typically far fewer than the total number of patches. In these few-step regimes, UDLM (and its hidden Gaussian counterparts (Schiff et al., 2024; Sahoo et al., 2025)) consistently outperforms the masked paradigm. Concretely, our experiments demonstrate that UDLM outperforms MDLM by 17.6% when generating ImageNet-1K images in an 8step regime. Consequently, balancing the robust few-step generation of UDLMs with the superior semantic understanding of MDLMs remains critical open challenge. To this end, we propose miXed Diffusion Language Modeling (XDLM), balanced theoretical formulation that establishes rigorous bridge between uniform and masked noise distributions. Unlike GIDD (von Rütte et al., 2025), which relies on computationally expensive time-inhomogeneous process where noise characteristics shift at every timestep, XDLM enforces stationary noise kernel where incremental noise structurally matches the marginal noise, as shown in Fig. 1 (left). This consistency allows our training objective to be efficiently factorized into static constants and dynamic schedules, avoiding the complex re-computation of noise distributions required by GIDD. In addition, we prove that MDLM and UDLM are limiting cases of our formulation. Furthermore, XDLM enables memory-efficient implementation by algebraically simplifying posterior calculations, allowing XDLM to scale to large vocabulary sizes without prohibitive computational costs. Balancing Understanding and Generation in Discrete Diffusion Models Figure 1. Left: XDLM combines the noise kernel of UDLM (u) and MDLM (m) to achieve favorable trade-off between the two methods. [NORMAL] denotes normal tokens, while [MASK] represents the mask token. Right: The trade-off between understanding capability (zero-shot perplexity; lower is better) and generation capability (generation perplexity in 32 sampling steps; lower is better). The proposed XDLM with mixing ratio of = 0.1 achieves the optimal balance, labeled as the Sweet Spot. Experimental results demonstrate that XDLM consistently achieves superior performance across diverse modalities, validating the efficacy of our balanced discrete diffusion approach. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (right), XDLM advances the Pareto frontier between understanding capability and generative quality. Notably, as the interpolation parameters shift toward their extremes, XDLM matches the performance of UDLM and MDLM respectively, confirming the models theoretical foundation. Concretely, in zero-shot language benchmarks, XDLM surpasses UDLM by 5.4 points in averaged metrics and trails MDLM by only 0.45. In conditional image generation, XDLM excels in both efficiency and quality: it significantly outperforms MDLM in few-step generation (reducing FID from 80.8 to 54.1 at 4 steps) and ranks first at 16 steps, surpassing UDLM by 0.4 points. Furthermore, large-scale continual pretraining on 8B-parameter LLMs (Nie et al., 2025) yields an MBPP score of 15.0 in only 32 sampling steps, improving upon the vanilla LLaDA baseline by over 120% (15.0 vs. 6.8). Finally, analysis of training dynamics reveals distinct performance crossover: while masked baselines converge quickly but plateau early, XDLM sustains steady improvement throughout training, demonstrating superior long-term scaling. 2.

[ 1 4 5 4 3 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r aDespite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches often fail to generate personalized responses based on the users specific experiences, as they lack the ability to associate visual inputs with users accumulated visual-textual context. We newly formalize this challenge as contextualized visual personalization, which requires the visual recognition and textual retrieval of personalized visual experiences by VLMs when interpreting new images. To address this issue, we propose CoViP, unified framework that treats personalized image captioning as core task for contextualized visual personalization and improves this capability through reinforcement-learning-based post-training and caption-augmented generation. We further introduce diagnostic evaluations that explicitly rule out textual shortcut solutions and verify whether VLMs truly leverage visual context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that existing open-source and proprietary VLMs exhibit substantial limitations, while CoViP not only improves personalized image captioning but also yields holistic gains across downstream personalization tasks. These results highlight CoViP as crucial stage for enabling robust and generalizable contextualized visual personalization. Project Page 1. Introduction Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) (Liu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2025) have demonstrated impressive performance across wide range of vision-language tasks, including image cap- *Equal contribution 1Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea 2Samsung Electronics, South Korea 3Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology, Daegu, South Korea 4Interdisciplinary Program in Artificial Intelligence, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

Despite these advances, however, current VLMs remain limited in their ability to personalize visual understanding based on user-specific context (Wang et al., 2025; Team, 2025). For example, while VLM may correctly recognize person in an image as man wearing black suit, it typically fails to identify that the person corresponds to the users brother mentioned in prior interactions. This issue indicates that existing VLMs do not yet possess genuine capability for visual personalization. To address this limitation, growing body of work has explored methods for enhancing visual personalization in VLMs (Alaluf et al., 2024; Nguyen et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2025a). While existing methods successfully enable personalization over simple attributes or identities, they remain limited in scope. In particular, they do not account for personalization grounded in rich, experience-level user context, such as past interactions or episodic memories, which remains largely underexplored in existing literature (Hao et al., 2025; Nguyen et al., 2025; Hong et al., 2025; Oh et al., 2025; Doveh et al., 2025). In this work, we define such visual experiences as contextual history that integrates previously observed images with associated personal textual information. We consider setting in which VLMs maintain users past interactions in their context and are expected to leverage this history when interpreting new visual input. We refer to this realistic setting as contextualized visual personalization. Figure 1 illustrates the example of the use-case for contextual visual personalization in VLMs. In practice, personalization in real-world settings is inherently diverse and open-ended, as it depends on implicit user intent and fine-grained contextual cues. Consequently, relying solely on task-specific post-training is both insufficient and inefficient for achieving robust personalization, since it does not scale to the long tail of personalized, contextdependent behaviors in real-world interactions. To address this challenge, we propose unified approach to contextualized visual personalization that targets shared underlying process common across downstream tasks. We argue that this process naturally aligns with the objective of personalized image captioning, which focuses on grounding visual inputs in user-specific contextual knowledge, without reContextualized Visual Personalization in Vision-Language Models Figure 1. Qualitative example of the use-case for contextual visual personalization in VLMs. Note that our CoViP effectively responds to the question while integrating the mentioned personal details from the given multimodal contexts. quiring additional task-specific processing. Accordingly, we leverage personalized image captioning as proxy task to effectively model and learn this shared process. Building on this insight about personalization, we introduce CoViP (Contextualized Visual Personalization via Image Captioning), unified framework that enables holistic personalization by explicitly modeling this underlying process. CoViP formulates contextualized visual personalization as personalized image captioning task, in which VLM recognizes relevant visual concepts in query image, retrieves the corresponding user-specific context, and directly incorporates the retrieved information in the generated caption. Within this framework, we first construct novel and challenging personalized image captioning benchmark that faithfully captures the complexities of contextualized visual personalization. We then adopt reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training strategy to optimize VLMs for producing personalized captions through our captioning benchmark. At inference time, we further introduce caption-augmented generation (CAG), where the VLMs own generated caption is reused as an explicit conditioning signal to guide personalized response generation. Beyond modeling and training, we place particular emphasis on evaluation, as contextualized visual personalization should avoid spurious textual shortcuts (e.g., directly retrieving query-related hints from context without recognition) that allow VLMs to answer questions while bypassing visual understanding. To this end, we design suite of diagnostic downstream tasks that explicitly assess whether VLM correctly "

To address these limitations, we propose CoBA-RL, reinforcement learning algorithm designed to adaptively allocate rollout budgets based on the models evolving capability. Specifically, CoBA-RL utilizes Capability-Oriented Value function to map tasks to their potential training gains and employs heap-based greedy strategy to efficiently self-calibrate the distribution of computational resources to samples with high training value.

Introduction Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) (Lambert et al., 2024) has established itself as cornerstone for elevating LLM reasoning in agentic, coding, and mathematical domains (Guo et al., 2025; Work done during an internship at Meituan. 1Zhejiang University 2Nanjing University 3National University of Singapore 4Meituan 5Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Correspondence to: Zhiyuan Yao, Qi Gu. Preprint. February 4, 2026. 1 Figure 1. Comparison between GRPO-based methods and CoBA-RL. (a) GRPO employs uniform strategy independent of training progress. (b) CoBA-RL dynamically self-calibrates the allocation strategy throughout the training process. It autonomously directs the rollout budget toward instances with high training value, aligned with the models evolving capability. In this visualization, pi denotes the pass rate corresponding to the task instance xi. Yang et al., 2025; Comanici et al., 2025; Bai et al., 2025). Within this landscape, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024) and its variants (Yu et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025a; Liu et al., 2026; Shrivastava et al., 2025) have risen to prominence. By assigning uniform budget of rollouts to every prompt to compute group-relative advantages, GRPO eliminates the need for separate value network. However, ideally, the rollout budgets allocated to each instance should be commensurate with its training value.Intuitively, complex samples often harbor higher training value and demand extensive exploration, whereas simple instances require minimal resources. In practice, vanilla GRPO overlooks the critical impact of sample difficulty on training value and the corresponding rollout budget. While recent studies have begun to tailor budgets using instance-level metrics related to task difficulty, such as historical pass rates (Li et al., 2025b), these approaches typically rely on static value functions. They operate on the fixed assumption that harder samples inherently offer superior training value than simpler ones and that this relationship remains constant throughout the entire training CoBA-RL: Capability-Oriented Budget Allocation for Reinforcement Learning in LLMs process. This perspective neglects crucial reality: the true training value of sample is inextricably linked to the policy models real-time capabilities (Wang et al., 2025b; Zhang et al., 2025b; Wang et al., 2025a). As the models capabilities evolve during training, the set of samples holding the highest training value constantly shifts (Hu et al., 2025). To accommodate these variations, the allocation strategy must continuously calibrate the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration. Specifically, exploitation involves consolidating mastery over instances where the model already succeeds, whereas exploration requires allocating resources to sample diverse trajectories on challenging queries, thereby expanding the search space to discover potential solutions (Yang et al., 2026; Chen et al., 2025c; Hou et al., 2025; Cui et al., 2025). Consequently, it is imperative to quantify model capability to facilitate policy self-calibration, ensuring the rollout budget is continually re-aligned with the samples most suitable for the current training phase. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, We propose CoBARL, reinforcement learning algorithm that dynamically allocates the rollout budget in accordance with the models evolving capability. Specifically, we introduce CapabilityOriented Value function, modeled as Beta distribution, to map individual instances to their potential training value. By continuously monitoring the global failure rate of the current training batch, we quantify the models global capability and dynamically calibrate the shape of the value function, as shown in Figure 1. This mechanism autonomously orchestrates the exploration-exploitation trade-off: the value function shifts its high-density regions in real-time to prioritize either consolidating established knowledge or exploring high-uncertainty frontiers based on the models current competence. Finally, to operationalize this theoretical distribution, we present an Efficient Allocation Optimization algorithm. By formulating the allocation as constrained maximization problem, we employ heap-based greedy strategy that iteratively assigns budget to samples offering the highest marginal gain, thereby maximizing the aggregate value of the training batch. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base, Qwen2.5-7BInstruct, and Qwen3-1.7B/4B-Base models. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong baselines across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks. These findings suggest that, empowered by the Capability-Oriented Value function, CoBA-RL effectively identifies samples holding the high training value at the current training step, thereby achieving superior tra"

Text:"FaceLinkGen: Rethinking Identity Leakage in Privacy-Preserving Face Recognition with Identity Extraction Wenqi Guo 1 2 Shan Du 1 6 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 4 1 9 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract Transformation-based privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) aims to verify identities while hiding facial data from attackers and malicious service providers. Existing evaluations mostly treat privacy as resistance to pixel-level reconstruction, measured by PSNR and SSIM. We show that this reconstruction-centric view fails. We present FaceLinkGen, an identity extraction attack that performs linkage/matching and face regeneration directly from protected templates without recovering original pixels. On three recent PPFR systems, FaceLinkGen reaches over 98.5% matching accuracy and above 96% regeneration success, and still exceeds 92% matching and 94% regeneration in near zero knowledge setting. These results expose structural gap between pixel distortion metrics, which are widely used in PPFR evaluation, and real privacy. We show that visual obfuscation leaves identity information broadly exposed to both external intruders and untrusted service providers. 1. Introduction and Related Works The fundamental promise of transformation-based Privacy Preserving Face Recognition (PPFR) systems is compelling: verify users identity without ever exposing their raw facial data to potential attackers (Dai et al., 2025; Mi et al., 2023; 2024; 2022; Jin et al., 2024). Originally, the threat model was for curious or malicious recognition service provider (Erkin et al., 2009; Ji et al., 2022), but it now also includes, or shifted towards, external attackers by wiretapping (Mi et al., 2024) or leaked databases. We argue that robust leakage analysis must address both the service provider who inherently accesses the templates and the external intruder who obtains the templates by wiretapping or database leakage. 1Department of CMPS, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, Canada 2Weathon Software, Canada.

Text:"ObjEmbed: Towards Universal Multimodal Object Embeddings Shenghao Fu 1 2 Yukun Su 3 Fengyun Rao 3 Jing LYU 3 Xiaohua Xie 1 4 5 6 Wei-Shi Zheng 1 2 4Aligning objects with corresponding textual descriptions is fundamental challenge and realistic requirement in vision-language understanding. While recent multimodal embedding models excel at global image-text alignment, they often struggle with fine-grained alignment between image regions and specific phrases. In this work, we present ObjEmbed, novel MLLM embedding model that decomposes the input image into multiple regional embeddings, each corresponding to an individual object, along with global embeddings. It supports wide range of visual understanding tasks like visual grounding, local image retrieval, and global image retrieval. ObjEmbed enjoys three key properties: (1) ObjectOriented Representation: It captures both semantic and spatial aspects of objects by generating two complementary embeddings for each region: an object embedding for semantic matching and an IoU embedding that predicts localization quality. The final object matching score combines semantic similarity with the predicted IoU, enabling more accurate retrieval. (2) Versatility: It seamlessly handles both region-level and image-level tasks. (3) Efficient Encoding: All objects in an image, along with the full image, are encoded in single forward pass for high efficiency. Superior performance on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrates its strong semantic discrimination. Code is available at https: //github.com/WeChatCV/ObjEmbed. 6 2 0 2 3 ] .

ObjEmbed achieves balanced and superior performance across wide span of benchmarks. 1. Introduction Multimodal embedding models have emerged as cornerstone in bridging heterogeneous data modalities, such as vision, language, and audio, into unified semantic space, enabling rich cross-modal understanding, retrieval, and reasoning. Recent advances in large-scale image-text contrastive learning (Radford et al., 2021; Zhai et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2025b) have led to significant progress in multimodal representation learning, especially in aligning images and corresponding captions. Powered by large multimodal models (Bai et al., 2025b;a), embedding models (Zhang et al., 2024; 2025; Jiang et al., 2025c; Lan et al., 2025) can generate task-specific embeddings following user instructions, generate cross-modal embeddings with arbitrary modality combinations, and even perform high-level summary and deep reasoning through chain-of-thought. However, encoding objects within images and aligning them with text queries are still challenging for recent embedding ObjEmbed: Towards Universal Multimodal Object Embeddings models. Such capabilities are often critical in real-world applications such as autonomous driving (e.g., distant traffic signs), robotics (e.g., small parts manipulation), and digital content safety moderation. Reliable retrieval and representation of objects demand precise localization and strong semantic discrimination, yet remain under-addressed in current frameworks. While FG-CLIP (Xie et al., 2025b;a) improves regional alignment by combining regional and global contrastive objectives, its object embeddings lack explicit modeling of bounding box quality, limiting their reliability in localization-sensitive tasks. Another line of research, open-vocabulary object detection (Liu et al., 2024b; Fu et al., 2025c;b), directly aligning text embeddings with regions of interest, can accurately localize objects and perform openvocabulary recognition. However, due to limited training data, their generalization ability is largely constrained. To encode objects with high semantic discrimination and precise localization awareness, we introduce ObjEmbed, an MLLM-based object embedding model that encodes all objects within an image as embeddings. Given an input image, regions of interest (RoIs) are first extracted using an off-theshelf proposal generator and then encoded as sequence of tokens. Each object is represented by two special tokens: (1) an object token to capture fine-grained semantic content; and (2) an IoU token to predict the quality of the corresponding bounding box by regressing its IoU score with the ground truth. The object and IoU tokens, along with global image tokens, are processed in parallel by large language model (LLM) to ensure efficiency. The final-layer hidden states of these tokens serve as the object embeddings, IoU embeddings, and image embeddings, respectively. Similarly, text queries are independently encoded into text embeddings through the same LLM backbone, enabling seamless crossmodal alignment. With this novel architecture, ObjEmbed produces object-centric representations that jointly encode semantic meaning and localization confidence, enabling accurate recognition, precise localization, and robust crossmodal retrieval. Equipped with this object-centric design, ObjEmbed supports wide range of downstream applications in unified framework: (1) Object detection and referring expression comprehension: Class names or natural language expressions are encoded as text embeddings and matched against all object embeddings in the image. The final object matching score combines both semantic similarity (between object and text embeddings) and predicted localization quality (from the IoU embedding), computed as their product, effectively balancing semantic relevance and spatial accuracy. (2) Local image retrieval: When the query describes only specific region or object, we compute the image-level relevance as the maximum matching score across all detected objects. This strategy enables fine-grained, part-aware retrieval even when the target occupies small portion of the image. (3) Global image retrieval: Since ObjEmbed also retains global image embeddings, they can be directly used for standard image-text retrieval tasks, ensuring compatibility with conventional benchmarks and applications.

Text:"Adaptive Evidence Weighting for Audio-Spatiotemporal Fusion Oscar Ovanger 1 Levi Harris 2 Timothy H. KeittMany machine learning systems have access to multiple sources of evidence for the same prediction target, yet these sources often differ in reliability and informativeness across inputs. In bioacoustic classification, species identity may be inferred both from the acoustic signal and from spatiotemporal context such as location and season; while Bayesian inference motivates multiplicative evidence combination, in practice we typically only have access to discriminative predictors rather than calibrated generative models. We introduce Fusion under INdependent Conditional Hypotheses (FINCH), an adaptive log-linear evidence fusion framework that integrates pretrained audio classifier with structured spatiotemporal predictor. FINCH learns per-sample gating function that estimates the reliability of contextual information from uncertainty and informativeness statistics. The resulting fusion family contains the audio-only classifier as special case and explicitly bounds the influence of contextual evidence, yielding risk-contained hypothesis class with an interpretable audio-only fallback. Across benchmarks, FINCH consistently outperforms fixed-weight fusion and audio-only baselines, improving robustness and error trade-offs even when contextual information is weak in isolation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on CBI and competitive or improved performance on several subsets of BirdSet using lightweight, interpretable, evidence-based approach.

Introduction Ensemble learning studies how multiple predictive models for the same target variable can be combined to improve performance, robustness, or calibration relative to any single model (Kuncheva, 2004; Kittler et al., 1998). Classical ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting, and stacking typically assume that all predictors are trained on the same underlying data distribution and that ensemble weights or 1 Figure 1. Haemorhous mexicanus (North American House Finch), the namesake of our model. combination rules can be learned jointly with model parameters. In many modern applications, however, predictive models are pre-trained, heterogeneous, and fixed at inference time. These models may rely on different sources of evidence, be trained on distinct datasets, and operate under incompatible modeling assumptions. As result, joint retraining or finetuning is often infeasible. Instead, the problem becomes one of combining the outputs of fixed predictors in principled manner. We consider the common setting in which multiple predictive models provide complementary evidence about shared latent target. Let denote class label, and let and denote two sources of evidence. Conditional independence, y, (1) provides useful idealization that motivates multiplicative evidence fusion. If the full generative distributions were available, Bayesian inference would yield p(y x, s) p(x y) p(s y) p(y). (2) FINCH adopts the corresponding log-linear fusion form while remaining applicable in regimes where this independence assumption holds only approximately, and deviations can be mitigated through adaptive, bounded weighting. In practice, however, generative models are often unavailable. Instead, one typically has access only to discriminative predictors pθ(y x) and pψ(y s), trained independently. In this case, the posterior can be expressed as p(y x, s) pθ(y x) p(x) pψ(y s) p(s) p(y) , (3) Adaptive Evidence Weighting for Audio-Spatiotemporal Fusion where the marginal distributions p(x), p(s), and the implied prior p(y) are generally unknown. As result, the true posterior is not directly computable from the discriminative models alone. common approximation in this setting is to combine discriminative predictors using log-linear models or productof-experts formulations (Hinton, 2002; Genest & Zidek, 1986). These models operate directly on posterior outputs and define fused distribution of the form log p(y x, s) = log pθ(y x)+log pψ(y s)log Z(x, s), (4) where Z(x, s) is normalization constant ensuring (cid:80) p(y x, s) = 1. Throughout the paper, we write fusion rules in unnormalized log-space; the normalization constant is implicitly handled by the final softmax and is therefore omitted when it does not affect comparisons across classes. Log-linear fusion is decision-theoretically justified as logarithmic opinion pool under mild axioms (Heskes, 1998) and provides practical surrogate when only discriminative models are available. Existing approaches typically employ fixed or globally learned weights when combining predictors. This implicitly assumes that the relative reliability of each evidence source is constant across the input space. In many applications, this assumption does not hold. The informativeness of given evidence source may vary substantially across samples, leading to degraded performance or pathological dominance when fixed weights are used. In this work, we introduce an adaptive log-linear fusion framework that preserves the structure and interpretability of classical product-of-experts models while allowing persample modulation of evidence strength. We assume that the constituent predictors are fixed and discriminative, and we do not retrain or recalibrate their parameters. Instead, we learn gating function that estimates the reliability of contextual evidence on per-sample basis. The resulting fused posterior is defined (up to normalization) as log pω(y x, s) = log pθ(y x) + ω(x, s) log pψ(y s), (5) where ω(x, s) 0 is learned weighting function. The normalized posterior pω(y x, s) is obtained by applying softmax over y. This formulation recovers the first model classifier when ω(x, s) = 0, bounds the influence of contextual evidence, and enables adaptive fusion without retraining the base models. We evaluate this framework in the context of bioacoustic species classification by combining state-of-the-art acoustic classifier with structured spatiotemporal prior derived from large-scale observational data. Experiments show that adaptive weighting consistently outperforms fixed-weight fusion and audio-only baselines, particularly in regimes where contextual information is heterogeneous or weak in isolation. 2. Related Work We organize related work into two themes: (i) theory and mechanisms for combining probabilistic predictors (loglinear pooling, p"

Current LLM-based agents struggle here, often generating monolithic scripts that ignore execution costs and causal factors. We introduce MARS (Modular Agent with Reflective Search), framework optimized for autonomous AI research. MARS relies on three pillars: (1) Budget-Aware Planning via cost-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explicitly balance performance with execution expense; (2) Modular Construction, employing Design-Decompose-Implement pipeline to manage complex research repositories; and (3) Comparative Reflective Memory, which addresses credit assignment by analyzing solution differences to distill high-signal insights. MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source frameworks on MLE-Bench under comparable settings, maintaining competitiveness with the global leaderboards top methods. Furthermore, the system exhibits qualitative Aha! moments, where 63% of all utilized lessons originate from cross-branch transfer, demonstrating that the agent effectively generalizes insights across search paths. 1.

Multimodal large language models can effectively understand source code when represented as compressed images, achieving significant token reduction while maintaining or improving performance on code comprehension tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in source code understanding, yet as software systems grow in scale, computational efficiency has become a critical bottleneck. Currently, these models rely on a text-based paradigm that treats source code as a linear sequence of tokens, which leads to a linear increase in context length and associated computational costs. The rapid advancement of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) introduces an opportunity to optimize efficiency by representing source code as rendered images. Unlike text, which is difficult to compress without losing semantic meaning, the image modality is inherently suitable for compression. By adjusting resolution, images can be scaled to a fraction of their original token cost while remaining recognizable to vision-capable models. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conduct the first systematic study on the effectiveness of MLLMs for code understanding. Our experiments reveal that: (1) MLLMs can effectively understand code with substantial token reduction, achieving up to 8x compression; (2) MLLMs can effectively leverage visual cues such as syntax highlighting, improving code completion performance under 4x compression; and (3) Code-understanding tasks like clone detection exhibit exceptional resilience to visual compression, with some compression ratios even slightly outperforming raw text inputs. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of MLLMs in code understanding, which points out a shift toward image-modality code representation as a pathway to more efficient inference.

Current world models lack unified frameworks despite task-specific advances, necessitating a comprehensive approach integrating interaction, perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial representation.  					AI-generated summary 				 World models have emerged as a critical frontier in AI research, aiming to enhance large models by infusing them with physical dynamics and world knowledge. The core objective is to enable agents to understand, predict, and interact with complex environments. However, current research landscape remains fragmented, with approaches predominantly focused on injecting world knowledge into isolated tasks, such as visual prediction, 3D estimation, or symbol grounding, rather than establishing a unified definition or framework. While these task-specific integrations yield performance gains, they often lack the systematic coherence required for holistic world understanding. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of such fragmented approaches and propose a unified design specification for world models. We suggest that a robust world model should not be a loose collection of capabilities but a normative framework that integrally incorporates interaction, perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial representation. This work aims to provide a structured perspective to guide future research toward more general, robust, and principled models of the world.

DeepResearch report generation is improved through human-preference-aligned rubric generators trained via reinforcement learning with hybrid rewards and enhanced with multi-agent Markov-state workflows.  					AI-generated summary 				 Nowadays, training and evaluating DeepResearch-generated reports remain challenging due to the lack of verifiable reward signals. Accordingly, rubric-based evaluation has become a common practice. However, existing approaches either rely on coarse, pre-defined rubrics that lack sufficient granularity, or depend on manually constructed query-specific rubrics that are costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a pipeline to train human-preference-aligned query-specific rubric generators tailored for DeepResearch report generation. We first construct a dataset of DeepResearch-style queries annotated with human preferences over paired reports, and train rubric generators via reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward combining human preference supervision and LLM-based rubric evaluation.

"DeepResearch report generation is improved through human-preference-aligned rubric generators trained via reinforcement learning with hybrid rewards and enhanced with multi-agent Markov-state workflows.  					AI-generated summary 				 Nowadays, training and evaluating DeepResearch-generated reports remain challenging due to the lack of verifiable reward signals. Accordingly, rubric-based evaluation has become a common practice. However, existing approaches either rely on coarse, pre-defined rubrics that lack sufficient granularity, or depend on manually constructed query-specific rubrics that are costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a pipeline to train human-preference-aligned query-specific rubric generators tailored for DeepResearch report generation. We first construct a dataset of DeepResearch-style queries annotated with human preferences over paired reports, and train rubric generators via reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward combining human preference supervision and LLM-based rubric evaluation.

UnifiedReward-Flex combines reward modeling with flexible, context-adaptive reasoning to improve visual generation by dynamically constructing hierarchical assessments based on semantic intent and visual evidence.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have significantly propelled the development of visual generation. Existing frameworks typically adopt Bradley-Terry-style preference modeling or leverage generative VLMs as judges, and subsequently optimize visual generation models via reinforcement learning. However, current RMs suffer from inherent limitations: they often follow a one-size-fits-all paradigm that assumes a monolithic preference distribution or relies on fixed evaluation rubrics. As a result, they are insensitive to content-specific visual cues, leading to systematic misalignment with subjective and context-dependent human preferences. To this end, inspired by human assessment, we propose UnifiedReward-Flex, a unified personalized reward model for vision generation that couples reward modeling with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning. Specifically, given a prompt and the generated visual content, it first interprets the semantic intent and grounds on visual evidence, then dynamically constructs a hierarchical assessment by instantiating fine-grained criteria under both predefined and self-generated high-level dimensions. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage process: (1) we first distill structured, high-quality reasoning traces from advanced closed-source VLMs to bootstrap SFT, equipping the model with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning behaviors; (2) we then perform direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated preference pairs to further strengthen reasoning fidelity and discriminative alignment. To validate the effectiveness, we integrate UnifiedReward-Flex into the GRPO framework for image and video synthesis, and extensive results demonstrate its superiority.

Parallel-Probe is a training-free controller that optimizes parallel thinking by using consensus-based early stopping and deviation-based branch pruning to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Parallel thinking has emerged as a promising paradigm for reasoning, yet it imposes significant computational burdens. Existing efficiency methods primarily rely on local, per-trajectory signals and lack principled mechanisms to exploit global dynamics across parallel branches. We introduce 2D probing, an interface that exposes the width-depth dynamics of parallel thinking by periodically eliciting intermediate answers from all branches. Our analysis reveals three key insights: non-monotonic scaling across width-depth allocations, heterogeneous reasoning branch lengths, and early stabilization of global consensus. Guided by these insights, we introduce Parallel-Probe, a training-free controller designed to optimize online parallel thinking. Parallel-Probe employs consensus-based early stopping to regulate reasoning depth and deviation-based branch pruning to dynamically adjust width. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and multiple models demonstrate that Parallel-Probe establishes a superior Pareto frontier for test-time scaling. Compared to standard majority voting, it reduces sequential tokens by up to 35.8% and total token cost by over 25.8% while maintaining competitive accuracy.

AdaptMMBench presents a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating adaptive multimodal reasoning in Vision-Language Models, measuring reasoning mode selection rationality through dynamic difficulty assessment and multi-dimensional process evaluation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Adaptive multimodal reasoning has emerged as a promising frontier in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to dynamically modulate between tool-augmented visual reasoning and text reasoning to enhance both effectiveness and efficiency. However, existing evaluations rely on static difficulty labels and simplistic metrics, which fail to capture the dynamic nature of difficulty relative to varying model capacities. Consequently, they obscure the distinction between adaptive mode selection and general performance while neglecting fine-grained process analyses. In this paper, we propose AdaptMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for adaptive multimodal reasoning across five domains: real-world, OCR, GUI, knowledge, and math, encompassing both direct perception and complex reasoning tasks. AdaptMMBench utilizes a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metric to evaluate the selection rationality of different reasoning modes, isolating this meta-cognition ability by dynamically identifying task difficulties based on models' capability boundaries. Moreover, AdaptMMBench facilitates multi-dimensional process evaluation across key step coverage, tool effectiveness, and computational efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that while adaptive mode selection scales with model capacity, it notably decouples from final accuracy. Conversely, key step coverage aligns with performance, though tool effectiveness remains highly inconsistent across model architectures.

Wide Research advances search intelligence through a dedicated benchmark and multi-agent architecture that enables parallel information retrieval under complex constraints.  					AI-generated summary 				 Search intelligence is evolving from Deep Research to Wide Research, a paradigm essential for retrieving and synthesizing comprehensive information under complex constraints in parallel. However, progress in this field is impeded by the lack of dedicated benchmarks and optimization methodologies for search breadth. To address these challenges, we take a deep dive into Wide Research from two perspectives: Data Pipeline and Agent Optimization. First, we produce WideSeekBench, a General Broad Information Seeking (GBIS) benchmark constructed via a rigorous multi-phase data pipeline to ensure diversity across the target information volume, logical constraints, and domains. Second, we introduce WideSeek, a dynamic hierarchical multi-agent architecture that can autonomously fork parallel sub-agents based on task requirements. Furthermore, we design a unified training framework that linearizes multi-agent trajectories and optimizes the system using end-to-end RL. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of WideSeek and multi-agent RL, highlighting that scaling the number of agents is a promising direction for advancing the Wide Research paradigm.

LENS framework improves reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by identifying and removing interference tokens to enhance exploration efficiency and training stability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning, but remains constrained by inefficient exploration under limited rollout budgets, leading to low sampling success and unstable training in complex tasks. We find that many exploration failures arise not from problem difficulty, but from a small number of prompt tokens that introduce interference. Building on this insight, we propose the Less Noise Sampling Framework (LENS), which first prompts by identifying and removing interference tokens. then transfers successful rollouts from the purification process to supervise policy optimization on the original noisy prompts, enabling the model to learn to ignore interference in the real-world, noisy prompting settings. Experimental results show that LENS significantly outperforms GRPO, delivering higher performance and faster convergence, with a 3.88% average gain and over 1.6times speedup. Our work highlights the critical role of pruning interference tokens in improving rollout efficiency, offering a new perspective for RLVR research.

"LENS framework improves reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by identifying and removing interference tokens to enhance exploration efficiency and training stability.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning, but remains constrained by inefficient exploration under limited rollout budgets, leading to low sampling success and unstable training in complex tasks. We find that many exploration failures arise not from problem difficulty, but from a small number of prompt tokens that introduce interference. Building on this insight, we propose the Less Noise Sampling Framework (LENS), which first prompts by identifying and removing interference tokens. then transfers successful rollouts from the purification process to supervise policy optimization on the original noisy prompts, enabling the model to learn to ignore interference in the real-world, noisy prompting settings. Experimental results show that LENS significantly outperforms GRPO, delivering higher performance and faster convergence, with a 3.88% average gain and over 1.6times speedup. Our work highlights the critical role of pruning interference tokens in improving rollout efficiency, offering a new perspective for RLVR research."

Research investigates latent planning dynamics in large language models through a probing method called Tele-Lens, revealing limited global planning and enabling improved uncertainty estimation and CoT bypass recognition.  					AI-generated summary 				 This work stems from prior complementary observations on the dynamics of Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Large Language Models (LLMs) is shown latent planning of subsequent reasoning prior to CoT emergence, thereby diminishing the significance of explicit CoT; whereas CoT remains critical for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To deepen the understanding between LLM's internal states and its verbalized reasoning trajectories, we investigate the latent planning strength of LLMs, through our probing method, Tele-Lens, applying to hidden states across diverse task domains. Our empirical results indicate that LLMs exhibit a myopic horizon, primarily conducting incremental transitions without precise global planning. Leveraging this characteristic, we propose a hypothesis on enhancing uncertainty estimation of CoT, which we validate that a small subset of CoT positions can effectively represent the uncertainty of the entire path. We further underscore the significance of exploiting CoT dynamics, and demonstrate that automatic recognition of CoT bypass can be achieved without performance degradation.

DeMix is a framework that uses model merging to predict optimal data ratios for LLM pre-training, decoupling search from training costs to improve mixture discovery efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Determining an effective data mixture is a key factor in Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training, where models must balance general competence with proficiency on hard tasks such as math and code. However, identifying an optimal mixture remains an open challenge, as existing approaches either rely on unreliable tiny-scale proxy experiments or require prohibitively expensive large-scale exploration. To address this, we propose Decouple Searching from Training Mix (DeMix), a novel framework that leverages model merging to predict optimal data ratios. Instead of training proxy models for every sampled mixture, DeMix trains component models on candidate datasets at scale and derives data mixture proxies via weighted model merging. This paradigm decouples search from training costs, enabling evaluation of unlimited sampled mixtures without extra training burden and thus facilitating better mixture discovery through more search trials. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMix breaks the trade-off between sufficiency, accuracy and efficiency, obtaining the optimal mixture with higher benchmark performance at lower search cost. Additionally, we release the DeMix Corpora, a comprehensive 22T-token dataset comprising high-quality pre-training data with validated mixtures to facilitate open research. Our code and DeMix Corpora is available at https://github.com/Lucius-lsr/DeMix.

XDLM unifies Masked Diffusion Language Models and Uniform-noise Diffusion Language Models through a stationary noise kernel, achieving improved performance in both semantic understanding and generation quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 In discrete generative modeling, two dominant paradigms demonstrate divergent capabilities: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLM) excel at semantic understanding and zero-shot generalization, whereas Uniform-noise Diffusion Language Models (UDLM) achieve strong few-step generation quality, yet neither attains balanced performance across both dimensions. To address this, we propose XDLM, which bridges the two paradigms via a stationary noise kernel. XDLM offers two key contributions: (1) it provides a principled theoretical unification of MDLM and UDLM, recovering each paradigm as a special case; and (2) an alleviated memory bottleneck enabled by an algebraic simplification of the posterior probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that XDLM advances the Pareto frontier between understanding capability and generation quality. Quantitatively, XDLM surpasses UDLM by 5.4 points on zero-shot text benchmarks and outperforms MDLM in few-step image generation (FID 54.1 vs. 80.8). When scaled to tune an 8B-parameter large language model, XDLM achieves 15.0 MBPP in just 32 steps, effectively doubling the baseline performance. Finally, analysis of training dynamics reveals XDLM's superior potential for long-term scaling. Code is available at https://github.com/MzeroMiko/XDLM

To address this, we propose XDLM, which bridges the two paradigms via a stationary noise kernel.

Quantitatively, XDLM surpasses UDLM by 5.4 points on zero-shot text benchmarks and outperforms MDLM in few-step image generation (FID 54.1 vs. 80.8).

A reinforcement learning framework with glance and focus models improves pan-cancer screening in CT scans by addressing foreground-background imbalance and reducing false positives through group relative learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Pan-cancer screening in large-scale CT scans remains challenging for existing AI methods, primarily due to the difficulty of localizing diverse types of tiny lesions in large CT volumes. The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen. Notably, GF-Screen leads the public validation leaderboard of MICCAI FLARE25 pan-cancer challenge, surpassing the FLARE24 champion solution by a large margin (+25.6% DSC and +28.2% NSD).

CoViP addresses contextualized visual personalization by treating personalized image captioning as a core task and improving capabilities through reinforcement-learning-based post-training and caption-augmented generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches often fail to generate personalized responses based on the user's specific experiences, as they lack the ability to associate visual inputs with a user's accumulated visual-textual context. We newly formalize this challenge as contextualized visual personalization, which requires the visual recognition and textual retrieval of personalized visual experiences by VLMs when interpreting new images. To address this issue, we propose CoViP, a unified framework that treats personalized image captioning as a core task for contextualized visual personalization and improves this capability through reinforcement-learning-based post-training and caption-augmented generation. We further introduce diagnostic evaluations that explicitly rule out textual shortcut solutions and verify whether VLMs truly leverage visual context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that existing open-source and proprietary VLMs exhibit substantial limitations, while CoViP not only improves personalized image captioning but also yields holistic gains across downstream personalization tasks. These results highlight CoViP as a crucial stage for enabling robust and generalizable contextualized visual personalization.

CoBA-RL adapts rollout budget allocation for LLM training by evaluating sample training value and optimizing resource distribution through a capability-oriented value function and greedy strategy.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key approach for enhancing LLM reasoning.However, standard frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) typically employ a uniform rollout budget, leading to resource inefficiency. Moreover, existing adaptive methods often rely on instance-level metrics, such as task pass rates, failing to capture the model's dynamic learning state. To address these limitations, we propose CoBA-RL, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to adaptively allocate rollout budgets based on the model's evolving capability. Specifically, CoBA-RL utilizes a Capability-Oriented Value function to map tasks to their potential training gains and employs a heap-based greedy strategy to efficiently self-calibrate the distribution of computational resources to samples with high training value. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively orchestrates the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, delivering consistent generalization improvements across multiple challenging benchmarks. These findings underscore that quantifying sample training value and optimizing budget allocation are pivotal for advancing LLM post-training efficiency.

FaceLinkGen attack demonstrates that current privacy-preserving face recognition methods fail to protect identity information despite pixel-level distortion metrics suggesting adequate protection.  					AI-generated summary 				 Transformation-based privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) aims to verify identities while hiding facial data from attackers and malicious service providers. Existing evaluations mostly treat privacy as resistance to pixel-level reconstruction, measured by PSNR and SSIM. We show that this reconstruction-centric view fails. We present FaceLinkGen, an identity extraction attack that performs linkage/matching and face regeneration directly from protected templates without recovering original pixels. On three recent PPFR systems, FaceLinkGen reaches over 98.5\% matching accuracy and above 96\% regeneration success, and still exceeds 92\% matching and 94\% regeneration in a near zero knowledge setting. These results expose a structural gap between pixel distortion metrics, which are widely used in PPFR evaluation, and real privacy. We show that visual obfuscation leaves identity information broadly exposed to both external intruders and untrusted service providers.

Advanced AI models demonstrate capability in supporting expert-level mathematical discovery and scientific research through collaborative approaches involving proof verification and automated code execution.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for accelerating scientific research. While models are increasingly capable of assisting with routine tasks, their ability to contribute to novel, expert-level mathematical discovery is less understood. We present a collection of case studies demonstrating how researchers have successfully collaborated with advanced AI models, specifically Google's Gemini-based models (in particular Gemini Deep Think and its advanced variants), to solve open problems, refute conjectures, and generate new proofs across diverse areas in theoretical computer science, as well as other areas such as economics, optimization, and physics. Based on these experiences, we extract common techniques for effective human-AI collaboration in theoretical research, such as iterative refinement, problem decomposition, and cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer. While the majority of our results stem from this interactive, conversational methodology, we also highlight specific instances that push beyond standard chat interfaces. These include deploying the model as a rigorous adversarial reviewer to detect subtle flaws in existing proofs, and embedding it within a "neuro-symbolic" loop that autonomously writes and executes code to verify complex derivations. Together, these examples highlight the potential of AI not just as a tool for automation, but as a versatile, genuine partner in the creative process of scientific discovery.

3DiMo enables view-agnostic human motion control in video generation by training a motion encoder alongside a pretrained video generator to distill driving frames into compact motion tokens that align with the generator's spatial priors.  					AI-generated summary 				 Existing methods for human motion control in video generation typically rely on either 2D poses or explicit 3D parametric models (e.g., SMPL) as control signals. However, 2D poses rigidly bind motion to the driving viewpoint, precluding novel-view synthesis. Explicit 3D models, though structurally informative, suffer from inherent inaccuracies (e.g., depth ambiguity and inaccurate dynamics) which, when used as a strong constraint, override the powerful intrinsic 3D awareness of large-scale video generators. In this work, we revisit motion control from a 3D-aware perspective, advocating for an implicit, view-agnostic motion representation that naturally aligns with the generator's spatial priors rather than depending on externally reconstructed constraints. We introduce 3DiMo, which jointly trains a motion encoder with a pretrained video generator to distill driving frames into compact, view-agnostic motion tokens, injected semantically via cross-attention. To foster 3D awareness, we train with view-rich supervision (i.e., single-view, multi-view, and moving-camera videos), forcing motion consistency across diverse viewpoints. Additionally, we use auxiliary geometric supervision that leverages SMPL only for early initialization and is annealed to zero, enabling the model to transition from external 3D guidance to learning genuine 3D spatial motion understanding from the data and the generator's priors. Experiments confirm that 3DiMo faithfully reproduces driving motions with flexible, text-driven camera control, significantly surpassing existing methods in both motion fidelity and visual quality.

ObjEmbed is a novel multimodal language-model embedding approach that decomposes images into regional embeddings for improved object-level visual understanding and retrieval tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Aligning objects with corresponding textual descriptions is a fundamental challenge and a realistic requirement in vision-language understanding. While recent multimodal embedding models excel at global image-text alignment, they often struggle with fine-grained alignment between image regions and specific phrases. In this work, we present ObjEmbed, a novel MLLM embedding model that decomposes the input image into multiple regional embeddings, each corresponding to an individual object, along with global embeddings. It supports a wide range of visual understanding tasks like visual grounding, local image retrieval, and global image retrieval. ObjEmbed enjoys three key properties: (1) Object-Oriented Representation: It captures both semantic and spatial aspects of objects by generating two complementary embeddings for each region: an object embedding for semantic matching and an IoU embedding that predicts localization quality. The final object matching score combines semantic similarity with the predicted IoU, enabling more accurate retrieval. (2) Versatility: It seamlessly handles both region-level and image-level tasks. (3) Efficient Encoding: All objects in an image, along with the full image, are encoded in a single forward pass for high efficiency. Superior performance on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrates its strong semantic discrimination.

"ObjEmbed is a novel multimodal language-model embedding approach that decomposes images into regional embeddings for improved object-level visual understanding and retrieval tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Aligning objects with corresponding textual descriptions is a fundamental challenge and a realistic requirement in vision-language understanding. While recent multimodal embedding models excel at global image-text alignment, they often struggle with fine-grained alignment between image regions and specific phrases. In this work, we present ObjEmbed, a novel MLLM embedding model that decomposes the input image into multiple regional embeddings, each corresponding to an individual object, along with global embeddings. It supports a wide range of visual understanding tasks like visual grounding, local image retrieval, and global image retrieval. ObjEmbed enjoys three key properties: (1) Object-Oriented Representation: It captures both semantic and spatial aspects of objects by generating two complementary embeddings for each region: an object embedding for semantic matching and an IoU embedding that predicts localization quality. The final object matching score combines semantic similarity with the predicted IoU, enabling more accurate retrieval. (2) Versatility: It seamlessly handles both region-level and image-level tasks. (3) Efficient Encoding: All objects in an image, along with the full image, are encoded in a single forward pass for high efficiency. Superior performance on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrates its strong semantic discrimination."

A fusion framework called FINCH combines audio and spatiotemporal predictors for bioacoustic classification by adaptively weighting evidence based on reliability estimates, outperforming fixed-weight methods and audio-only approaches.  					AI-generated summary 				 Many machine learning systems have access to multiple sources of evidence for the same prediction target, yet these sources often differ in reliability and informativeness across inputs. In bioacoustic classification, species identity may be inferred both from the acoustic signal and from spatiotemporal context such as location and season; while Bayesian inference motivates multiplicative evidence combination, in practice we typically only have access to discriminative predictors rather than calibrated generative models. We introduce Fusion under INdependent Conditional Hypotheses (FINCH), an adaptive log-linear evidence fusion framework that integrates a pre-trained audio classifier with a structured spatiotemporal predictor. FINCH learns a per-sample gating function that estimates the reliability of contextual information from uncertainty and informativeness statistics. The resulting fusion family contains the audio-only classifier as a special case and explicitly bounds the influence of contextual evidence, yielding a risk-contained hypothesis class with an interpretable audio-only fallback. Across benchmarks, FINCH consistently outperforms fixed-weight fusion and audio-only baselines, improving robustness and error trade-offs even when contextual information is weak in isolation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on CBI and competitive or improved performance on several subsets of BirdSet using a lightweight, interpretable, evidence-based approach.

Search-R2 framework improves language agent reasoning through Actor-Refiner collaboration with targeted interventions and fine-grained reward supervision for better credit assignment in reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 Search-integrated reasoning enables language agents to transcend static parametric knowledge by actively querying external sources. However, training these agents via reinforcement learning is hindered by the multi-scale credit assignment problem: existing methods typically rely on sparse, trajectory-level rewards that fail to distinguish between high-quality reasoning and fortuitous guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors. To address this, we propose Search-R2, a novel Actor-Refiner collaboration framework that enhances reasoning through targeted intervention, with both components jointly optimized during training. Our approach decomposes the generation process into an Actor, which produces initial reasoning trajectories, and a Meta-Refiner, which selectively diagnoses and repairs flawed steps via a 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. To provide fine-grained supervision, we introduce a hybrid reward design that couples outcome correctness with a dense process reward quantifying the information density of retrieved evidence. Theoretically, we formalize the Actor-Refiner interaction as a smoothed mixture policy, proving that selective correction yields strict performance gains over strong baselines. Extensive experiments across various general and multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL-based baselines across model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead.

MARS is a modular AI research automation framework that uses budget-aware planning, modular construction, and reflective memory to achieve state-of-the-art performance in autonomous machine learning research.  					AI-generated summary 				 Automating AI research differs from general software engineering due to computationally expensive evaluation (e.g., model training) and opaque performance attribution. Current LLM-based agents struggle here, often generating monolithic scripts that ignore execution costs and causal factors. We introduce MARS (Modular Agent with Reflective Search), a framework optimized for autonomous AI research. MARS relies on three pillars: (1) Budget-Aware Planning via cost-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explicitly balance performance with execution expense; (2) Modular Construction, employing a "Design-Decompose-Implement" pipeline to manage complex research repositories; and (3) Comparative Reflective Memory, which addresses credit assignment by analyzing solution differences to distill high-signal insights. MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source frameworks on MLE-Bench under comparable settings, maintaining competitiveness with the global leaderboard's top methods. Furthermore, the system exhibits qualitative "Aha!" moments, where 63% of all utilized lessons originate from cross-branch transfer, demonstrating that the agent effectively generalizes insights across search paths.

"MARS is a modular AI research automation framework that uses budget-aware planning, modular construction, and reflective memory to achieve state-of-the-art performance in autonomous machine learning research.  					AI-generated summary 				 Automating AI research differs from general software engineering due to computationally expensive evaluation (e.g., model training) and opaque performance attribution. Current LLM-based agents struggle here, often generating monolithic scripts that ignore execution costs and causal factors. We introduce MARS (Modular Agent with Reflective Search), a framework optimized for autonomous AI research. MARS relies on three pillars: (1) Budget-Aware Planning via cost-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explicitly balance performance with execution expense; (2) Modular Construction, employing a "Design-Decompose-Implement" pipeline to manage complex research repositories; and (3) Comparative Reflective Memory, which addresses credit assignment by analyzing solution differences to distill high-signal insights. MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source frameworks on MLE-Bench under comparable settings, maintaining competitiveness with the global leaderboard's top methods. Furthermore, the system exhibits qualitative "Aha!" moments, where 63% of all utilized lessons originate from cross-branch transfer, demonstrating that the agent effectively generalizes insights across search paths."
