San Jose, CA, USA Daniel Lee dlee1@adobe.com Adobe Inc. San Jose, CA, USA Ziang Xiao ziang.xiao@jhu.edu Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, MD, USA Zheng Zhang zhengzhang@adobe.com Adobe Inc. San Jose, CA, USA Guang-Jie Ren gren@adobe.com Adobe Inc. San Jose, CA, USA Yunyao Li yunyaol@adobe.com Adobe Inc. San Jose, CA, USA Abstract High-quality feedback is essential for effective humanAI interaction. It bridges knowledge gaps, corrects digressions, and shapes system behavior; both during interaction and throughout model development. Yet despite its importance, human feedback to AI is often infrequent and low quality. This gap motivates critical examination of human feedback during interactions with AIs. To understand and overcome the challenges preventing users from giving high-quality feedback, we conducted two studies examining feedback dynamics between humans and conversational agents (CAs). Our formative study, through the lens of Grices maxims, identified four Feedback BarriersCommon Ground, Verifiability, Communication, and Informativenessthat prevent high-quality feedback by users. Building on these findings, we derive three design desiderata and show that systems incorporating scaffolds aligned with these desiderata enabled users to provide higher-quality feedback. Finally, we detail call for action to the broader AI community for advances in Large Language Models capabilities to overcome Feedback Barriers.

Text:"6 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 1 5 7 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Scaling Small Agents Through Strategy Auctions Lisa Alazraki,2, William F. Shen,3, Yoram Bachrach1, Akhil Mathur1 1Meta Superintelligence Labs, 2Imperial College London, 3University of Cambridge Work done at Meta Small language models are increasingly viewed as promising, cost-effective approach to agentic AI, with proponents claiming they are sufficiently capable for agentic workflows. However, while smaller agents can closely match larger ones on simple tasks, it remains unclear how their performance scales with task complexity, when large models become necessary, and how to better leverage small agents for long-horizon workloads. In this work, we empirically show that small agents performance fails to scale with task complexity on deep search and coding tasks, and we introduce Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency (sale), an agent framework inspired by freelancer marketplaces. In sale, agents bid with short strategic plans, which are scored by systematic costvalue mechanism and refined via shared auction memory, enabling per-task routing and continual self-improvement without training separate router or running all models to completion. Across deep search and coding tasks of varying complexity, sale reduces reliance on the largest agent by 53%, lowers overall cost by 35%, and consistently improves upon the largest agents pass@1 with only negligible overhead beyond executing the final trace. In contrast, established routers that rely on task descriptions either underperform the largest agent or fail to reduce costoften bothunderscoring their poor fit for agentic workflows. These results suggest that while small agents may be insufficient for complex workloads, they can be effectively scaled up through coordinated task allocation and test-time self-improvement. More broadly, they motivate systems-level view of agentic AI in which performance gains come less from ever-larger individual models and more from market-inspire"

High-quality feedback is essential for effective human-AI interaction. It bridges knowledge gaps, corrects digressions, and shapes system behavior; both during interaction and throughout model development. Yet despite its importance, human feedback to AI is often infrequent and low quality. This gap motivates a critical examination of human feedback during interactions with AIs. To understand and overcome the challenges preventing users from giving high-quality feedback, we conducted two studies examining feedback dynamics between humans and conversational agents (CAs). Our formative study, through the lens of Grice's maxims, identified four Feedback Barriers -- Common Ground, Verifiability, Communication, and Informativeness -- that prevent high-quality feedback by users. Building on these findings, we derive three design desiderata and show that systems incorporating scaffolds aligned with these desiderata enabled users to provide higher-quality feedback. Finally, we detail a call for action to the broader AI community for advances in Large Language Models capabilities to overcome Feedback Barriers.

Small language models struggle with complex tasks but can be effectively coordinated through a marketplace-inspired framework that reduces costs and improves performance through strategic bidding and self-improvement mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Small language models are increasingly viewed as a promising, cost-effective approach to agentic AI, with proponents claiming they are sufficiently capable for agentic workflows. However, while smaller agents can closely match larger ones on simple tasks, it remains unclear how their performance scales with task complexity, when large models become necessary, and how to better leverage small agents for long-horizon workloads. In this work, we empirically show that small agents' performance fails to scale with task complexity on deep search and coding tasks, and we introduce Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency (SALE), an agent framework inspired by freelancer marketplaces. In SALE, agents bid with short strategic plans, which are scored by a systematic cost-value mechanism and refined via a shared auction memory, enabling per-task routing and continual self-improvement without training a separate router or running all models to completion. Across deep search and coding tasks of varying complexity, SALE reduces reliance on the largest agent by 53%, lowers overall cost by 35%, and consistently improves upon the largest agent's pass@1 with only a negligible overhead beyond executing the final trace. In contrast, established routers that rely on task descriptions either underperform the largest agent or fail to reduce cost -- often both -- underscoring their poor fit for agentic workflows. These results suggest that while small agents may be insufficient for complex workloads, they can be effectively "scaled up" through coordinated task allocation and test-time self-improvement. More broadly, they motivate a systems-level view of agentic AI in which performance gains come less from ever-larger individual models and more from market-inspired coordination mechanisms that organize heterogeneous agents into efficient, adaptive ecosystems.
