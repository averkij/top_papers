Text:"6 2 0 2 2 ] . [ 1 1 5 7 2 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Scaling Small Agents Through Strategy Auctions Lisa Alazraki,2, William F. Shen,3, Yoram Bachrach1, Akhil Mathur1 1Meta Superintelligence Labs, 2Imperial College London, 3University of Cambridge Work done at Meta Small language models are increasingly viewed as promising, cost-effective approach to agentic AI, with proponents claiming they are sufficiently capable for agentic workflows. However, while smaller agents can closely match larger ones on simple tasks, it remains unclear how their performance scales with task complexity, when large models become necessary, and how to better leverage small agents for long-horizon workloads. In this work, we empirically show that small agents performance fails to scale with task complexity on deep search and coding tasks, and we introduce Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency (sale), an agent framework inspired by freelancer marketplaces. In sale, agents bid with short strategic plans, which are scored by systematic costvalue mechanism and refined via shared auction memory, enabling per-task routing and continual self-improvement without training separate router or running all models to completion. Across deep search and coding tasks of varying complexity, sale reduces reliance on the largest agent by 53%, lowers overall cost by 35%, and consistently improves upon the largest agents pass@1 with only negligible overhead beyond executing the final trace. In contrast, established routers that rely on task descriptions either underperform the largest agent or fail to reduce costoften bothunderscoring their poor fit for agentic workflows. These results suggest that while small agents may be insufficient for complex workloads, they can be effectively scaled up through coordinated task allocation and test-time self-improvement. More broadly, they motivate systems-level view of agentic AI in which performance gains come less from ever-larger individual models and more from market-inspire"

Text:"6 2 0 2 0 3 ] . [ 1 8 9 3 0 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r MemoryLLM: Plug-n-Play Interpretable Feed-Forward Memory for Transformers Ajay Jaiswal, Lauren Hannah, Han-Byul Kim, Duc Hoang, Arnav Kundu, Mehrdad Farajtabar, Minsik Cho Apple Understanding how transformer components operate in LLMs is important, as it is at the core of recent technological advances in artificial intelligence. In this work, we revisit the challenges associated with interpretability of feed-forward modules (FFNs) and propose MemoryLLM, which aims to decouple FFNs from self-attention and enables us to study the decoupled FFNs as context-free token-wise neural retrieval memory. In detail, we investigate how input tokens access memory locations within FFN parameters and the importance of FFN memory across different downstream tasks. MemoryLLM achieves context-free FFNs by training them in isolation from self-attention directly using the token embeddings. This approach allows FFNs to be pre-computed as token-wise lookups (ToLs), enabling on-demand transfer between VRAM and storage, additionally enhancing inference efficiency. We also introduce Flex-MemoryLLM, positioning it between conventional transformer design and MemoryLLM. This architecture bridges the performance gap caused by training FFNs with context-free token-wise embeddings. Correspondence: Ajay Jaiswal: ajaiswal23@apple.com Date: February 3, Large language models (LLMs) are omnipresent, demonstrating rapidly evolving capabilities across critical domains such as healthcare, finance, education, and mobility. Modern LLMs (Grattafiori et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025, 2024; Jiang et al., 2024; Adler et al., 2024; Gunter et al., 2024) are sequential stacks of transformer blocks in association with embedding layers that project textual input to latent representation for processing, followed by projection back to tokens. Each transformer block is constituted by two key computationally expensive components: self-attention (Attn) and feed-forward (FFN) modu"

Small language models struggle with complex tasks but can be effectively coordinated through a marketplace-inspired framework that reduces costs and improves performance through strategic bidding and self-improvement mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Small language models are increasingly viewed as a promising, cost-effective approach to agentic AI, with proponents claiming they are sufficiently capable for agentic workflows. However, while smaller agents can closely match larger ones on simple tasks, it remains unclear how their performance scales with task complexity, when large models become necessary, and how to better leverage small agents for long-horizon workloads. In this work, we empirically show that small agents' performance fails to scale with task complexity on deep search and coding tasks, and we introduce Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency (SALE), an agent framework inspired by freelancer marketplaces. In SALE, agents bid with short strategic plans, which are scored by a systematic cost-value mechanism and refined via a shared auction memory, enabling per-task routing and continual self-improvement without training a separate router or running all models to completion. Across deep search and coding tasks of varying complexity, SALE reduces reliance on the largest agent by 53%, lowers overall cost by 35%, and consistently improves upon the largest agent's pass@1 with only a negligible overhead beyond executing the final trace. In contrast, established routers that rely on task descriptions either underperform the largest agent or fail to reduce cost -- often both -- underscoring their poor fit for agentic workflows. These results suggest that while small agents may be insufficient for complex workloads, they can be effectively "scaled up" through coordinated task allocation and test-time self-improvement. More broadly, they motivate a systems-level view of agentic AI in which performance gains come less from ever-larger individual models and more from market-inspired coordination mechanisms that organize heterogeneous agents into efficient, adaptive ecosystems.

**Justification:**

- **OPTIMIZATION**: The paper introduces SALE (Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency), a framework focused on reducing costs (35% cost reduction), improving efficiency through strategic bidding mechanisms, and optimizing task allocation. This directly addresses training and operational optimization.

- **REASONING**: The paper evaluates performance on "deep search and coding tasks" and discusses how small language models struggle with "complex tasks" and "task complexity." The focus on reasoning-intensive workloads (search and coding) makes this relevant to reasoning capabilities.

High-quality feedback is essential for effective human-AI interaction. It bridges knowledge gaps, corrects digressions, and shapes system behavior; both during interaction and throughout model development. Yet despite its importance, human feedback to AI is often infrequent and low quality. This gap motivates a critical examination of human feedback during interactions with AIs. To understand and overcome the challenges preventing users from giving high-quality feedback, we conducted two studies examining feedback dynamics between humans and conversational agents (CAs). Our formative study, through the lens of Grice's maxims, identified four Feedback Barriers -- Common Ground, Verifiability, Communication, and Informativeness -- that prevent high-quality feedback by users. Building on these findings, we derive three design desiderata and show that systems incorporating scaffolds aligned with these desiderata enabled users to provide higher-quality feedback. Finally, we detail a call for action to the broader AI community for advances in Large Language Models capabilities to overcome Feedback Barriers.

MemoryLLM decouples feed-forward networks from self-attention in transformers, enabling context-free token-wise neural retrieval memory that improves inference efficiency through pre-computed lookups.  					AI-generated summary 				 Understanding how transformer components operate in LLMs is important, as it is at the core of recent technological advances in artificial intelligence. In this work, we revisit the challenges associated with interpretability of feed-forward modules (FFNs) and propose MemoryLLM, which aims to decouple FFNs from self-attention and enables us to study the decoupled FFNs as context-free token-wise neural retrieval memory. In detail, we investigate how input tokens access memory locations within FFN parameters and the importance of FFN memory across different downstream tasks. MemoryLLM achieves context-free FFNs by training them in isolation from self-attention directly using the token embeddings. This approach allows FFNs to be pre-computed as token-wise lookups (ToLs), enabling on-demand transfer between VRAM and storage, additionally enhancing inference efficiency. We also introduce Flex-MemoryLLM, positioning it between a conventional transformer design and MemoryLLM. This architecture bridges the performance gap caused by training FFNs with context-free token-wise embeddings.
