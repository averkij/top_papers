However, activating such capabilities through training remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we propose Parallel-R1, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning tasks. Our framework employs progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23, and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking, leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals clear shift in the models thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel thinking as an exploration strategy, while in later stage, it uses the same capability for multi-perspective verification.

It addresses critical limitations in OpenAIs benchmark, including noisy and incorrect labels, topical biases, and question redundancy. SimpleQA Verified was created through rigorous multi-stage filtering process involving de-duplication, topic balancing, and source reconciliation to produce more reliable and challenging evaluation set, alongside improvements in the autorater prompt. On this new benchmark, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves state-ofthe-art F1-score of 55.6, outperforming other frontier models, including GPT-5. This work provides the research community with higher-fidelity tool to track genuine progress in parametric model factuality and to mitigate hallucinations. The benchmark dataset, evaluation code, and leaderboard are available at: https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks/deepmind/simpleqa-verified. 1. Introduction The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate factually accurate information is vital for their utility and primary concern for widespread adoption. Inaccurate or "hallucinated" outputs erode user trust and still present barriers, particularly in critical enterprise applications where factual reliability is non-negotiable. Consequently, the rigorous evaluation of model factuality has become central focus of AI research, driving the need for benchmarks that can accurately measure and differentiate the capabilities of state-of-the-art systems. To meet this need, researchers have developed diverse evaluation paradigms. Many prominent approaches assess models ability to reason over externally provided information; this includes ground"

Text:"5 2 0 2 9 ] . [ 1 4 1 4 7 0 . 9 0 5 2 : r Language Self-Play For Data-Free Training Jakub Grudzien Kuba1,2, Mengting Gu1, Qi Ma1, Yuandong Tian1, Vijai Mohan 1Meta Superintelligence Labs, 2UC Berkeley Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by scale, abundant highquality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet this progress faces fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose reinforcement learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve without additional data. Our method leverages game-theoretic framework of self-play, where models capabilities are cast as performance in competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against itselfa process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven baselines. Date: September 2, 2025 Correspondence: Kuba at iamkuba@meta.com Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive datasets began mastering plethora of instruction following and reasoning tasks at levels of expert humans (Achiam et al., 2023; Rafailov et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Shao et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025). While in the initial stage of training, known as pre-training, the trained model absorbs vast amounts of information, post-training techniques, such as reinforcement learning (RL), enable the model to develop preferable behaviors and expertise in specialized tasks (Sutton et al., 1998; Schulman et al., 2017; Christiano et al., 2017). The RL paradigm is very different from the popular predictive or generative learning paradigms (Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David, 2014). While these try to either predict label (Krizhevsky et al., 2017) or to reconstruct th"

SEELE, a novel RLVR framework, dynamically adjusts problem difficulty using adaptive hint lengths to enhance exploration efficiency and improve performance in math reasoning tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration inefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the model's capability. LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems are overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are too simple. In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by quantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy. Building on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR framework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the high-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint (part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous hint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint length for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the optimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In each round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs collected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next round. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem difficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration efficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5 points, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.

Mini-o3, a system for deep, multi-turn reasoning in visual search tasks, uses an iterative data collection pipeline and over-turn masking strategy to achieve state-of-the-art performance with rich reasoning patterns.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses (those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning, thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

VIRAL, a regularization strategy, aligns MLLMs' visual representations with pre-trained VFMs, enhancing performance on vision-centric tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning. We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

"VIRAL, a regularization strategy, aligns MLLMs' visual representations with pre-trained VFMs, enhancing performance on vision-centric tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning. We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs."

SimpleQA Verified is a refined benchmark for evaluating the factuality of Large Language Models, addressing issues in previous benchmarks and providing a more reliable evaluation tool.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce SimpleQA Verified, a 1,000-prompt benchmark for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) short-form factuality based on OpenAI's SimpleQA. It addresses critical limitations in OpenAI's benchmark, including noisy and incorrect labels, topical biases, and question redundancy. SimpleQA Verified was created through a rigorous multi-stage filtering process involving de-duplication, topic balancing, and source reconciliation to produce a more reliable and challenging evaluation set, alongside improvements in the autorater prompt. On this new benchmark, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves a state-of-the-art F1-score of 55.6, outperforming other frontier models, including GPT-5. This work provides the research community with a higher-fidelity tool to track genuine progress in parametric model factuality and to mitigate hallucinations. The benchmark dataset, evaluation code, and leaderboard are available at: https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks/deepmind/simpleqa-verified.

Language Self-Play (LSP) enhances large language models' performance on instruction-following tasks through self-play, surpassing data-driven methods.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven baselines.
