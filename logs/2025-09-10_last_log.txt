[ 1 3 8 2 6 0 . 9 0 5 2 : r SFR-DeepResearch: Towards Effective Reinforcement Learning for Autonomously Reasoning Single Agents Xuan-Phi Nguyen Shrey Pandit Revanth Gangi Reddy Austin Xu Silvio Savarese Caiming Xiong Shafiq JotyEquipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning and tool-use capabilities has become key focus in agentic AI research, especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (thinking) models. Such capabilities are key to unlocking number of important applications. One such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in static workflow, an autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose simple RL recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanitys Last Exam benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more insights into our methodologies.The ability to call functions (or tools) is core and well-studied capability in building practical Large Language Models (LLMs) [23, 21]. By enabling models to interact with the real worldretrieving up-to-date, reliable information through internet search or executing complex computations via codetool use reduces hallucination and improves reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks. Among the many types of tool-integrated agents, web-based research agents, often referred to as Deep Research (DR) [30], have attracted notable attention in both closedand open-source communities. These agents use browsing and coding tools to answer challenging questions. Unlike agents that need to follow largely irreversible, acyclic workflows of tool calls (e.g., computer-use [36] or email agents), DR agents can invoke tools in flexible order. However, this flexibility demands advanced reasoning ability to plan and execute correct tool calls, e.g., searching for specific entities or writing Python code. DR systems are typically implemented as either single-agent or multi-agent systems. single-agent system, such as OpenAIs DeepResearch[30] or Kimi-Researcher [26], gives single, tool-equipped LLM the users question and allows it to autonomously perform actions like web search, webpage Project lead & corresponding authors: {xnguyen,cxiong,sjoty}@salesforce.com Work done during an internship at Salesforce AI Research. Technical Report. browsing, or coding in multi-turn format. Apart from the initial prompt, this agent receives no external directives at intermediate steps. In contrast, multi-agent DR system (e.g., OpenManus [22], Open DR [16]) typically employs complex workflow in which multiple agentspotentially powered by different LLMsare assigned distinct roles and task descriptions (e.g., orchestrator, planner, coder, researcher, supervisor). For instance, an orchestrator may decompose complex problem into sub-problems and dispatch them to specialized agents equipped with dedicated tools. In this work, we train autonomous single-agent LLMs to perform complex tasks using minimal set of tools: web search tool, web crawling tool, and Python interpreter. These agents are trained to process initial requirements and contextual information from tool outputs to autonomously plan and execute their next action. Our focus on single-agent systems stems from two beliefs: First, we believe single agents can generalize better to unseen tasks, as they are not constrained by the predefined, heuristic-based workflows common in multi-agent systems. Second, if more complex multi-agent scaffolding is used, single-agents can be seamlessly integrated as specialized sub-agents, thereby reducing overall system complexity by eliminating redundant deep research components. While some prior work has suggested to begin agentic training from instruction-tuned (SFT) or base (pre-SFT) models with cold-start instruction-tuning and RL [39, 17], we focus on continual RL training on reasoning-optimized models [41, 47, 1] to further improve agentic capabilities while also preserving their strong reasoning ability. Towards this end, we develop generic RL-based framework to improve the agentic capabilities of pre-trained reasoning models. The framework spans two main aspects: Agentic Inference Pipeline: We implement an agentic scaffolding that mirrors the way the initial LLMs are originally trained, closely resembling multi-turn conversation with tools. Additionally, we develop memory management system that allows the agent to manage its own memory, effectively enabling virtually unlimited context window. Specifically, we reserve portion of the fixed context length as memory buffer and provide the model with memory clean-up tool. During roll-out, the agent will be told if the memory exceeds the token buffer length, and tasked with using the clean-up tool to select only the information it deems important. We detail how this generic method is adapted for different base LLMs to account for their specific characteristics. RL Training Recipe: We developed novel pipeline to synthesize complex searchand reasoningintensive training datasets suitable for end-to-end RL, which are more difficult than existing open-source datasets [48, 12] and challenge even state-of-the-art DR agents [30]. To make use of such data, we developed reinforcement learning algorithm based on REINFORCE [43] with novel modifications that stabilize the policy optimization process. In particular, we find that agentic RL training can produce very diverse rollout scenarios with varied lengths (number of tool calls/turns). To mitigate these instabilities, we propose temporal advantage normalization and strategic trajectory filtering. We applied our recipes on three distinct reasoning models: QwQ-32B [41, 46], Qwen3-8B [47], and the recent gpt-oss-20b [1]. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our RL tuned models outperform many popular "

Continual reinforcement learning enhances autonomous single-agent models for deep research tasks, improving agentic skills and reasoning ability using synthetic data.  					AI-generated summary 				 Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research, especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models. Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more insights into our methodologies.
