Text:"LongKey: Keyphrase Extraction for Long Documents Jeovane Honorio Alves and Radu State SEDAN - SnT University of Luxembourg jeovane.alves,radu.state@uni.lu Cinthia Obladen de Almendra Freitas Graduate Program in Law (PPGD) Pontif√≠cia Universidade Cat√≥lica do Paran√° cinthia.freitas@pucpr.br Jean Paul Barddal Graduate Program in Informatics (PPGIa) Pontif√≠cia Universidade Cat√≥lica do Paran√° jean.barddal@ppgia.pucpr.br 4 2 0 2 6 ] . [ 1 3 6 8 7 1 . 1 1 4 2 : r AbstractIn an era of information overload, manually annotating the vast and growing corpus of documents and scholarly papers is increasingly impractical. Automated keyphrase extraction addresses this challenge by identifying representative terms within texts. However, most existing methods focus on short documents (up to 512 tokens), leaving gap in processing long-context documents. In this paper, we introduce LongKey, novel framework for extracting keyphrases from lengthy documents, which uses an encoder-based language model to capture extended text intricacies. LongKey uses max-pooling embedder to enhance keyphrase candidate representation. Validated on the comprehensive LDKP datasets and six diverse, unseen datasets, LongKey consistently outperforms existing unsupervised and language model-based keyphrase extraction methods. Our findings demonstrate LongKeys versatility and superior performance, marking an advancement in keyphrase extraction for varied text lengths and domains. I. INTRODUCTION Efficient extraction of vital information from textual documents across diverse domains is essential for effective information retrieval, especially given the vast volume of data on the internet and within organizational datasets. In response to this need, Keyphrase Extraction (KPE) aims to identify representative keyphrases that enhance document comprehension, retrieval, and information management [1], [2]. keyword encapsulates the central theme or distinct element of documents subject matter.

Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks like text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) synthesis. However, achieving accurate text alignment in T2V generation remains challenging due to the complex temporal dependency across frames. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches to enhance text alignment often require differentiable reward functions or are constrained to limited prompts, hindering their scalability and applicability. In this paper, we propose Free^2Guide, a novel gradient-free framework for aligning generated videos with text prompts without requiring additional model training. Leveraging principles from path integral control, Free^2Guide approximates guidance for diffusion models using non-differentiable reward functions, thereby enabling the integration of powerful black-box Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as reward model. Additionally, our framework supports the flexible ensembling of multiple reward models, including large-scale image-based models, to synergistically enhance alignment without incurring substantial computational overhead. We demonstrate that Free^2Guide significantly improves text alignment across various dimensions and enhances the overall quality of generated videos.

[29.11.2024 12:03] Claude request. Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620. Prompt: Read an abstract of the ML paper and return a JSON with fields: 'desc': explanation of the paper in Russian (4 sentences), use correct machine learning terms. 'emoji': emoji that will reflect the theme of an article somehow, only one emoji. 'title': a slogan of a main idea of the article in Russian. Return only JSON and nothing else.

In an era of information overload, manually annotating the vast and growing corpus of documents and scholarly papers is increasingly impractical. Automated keyphrase extraction addresses this challenge by identifying representative terms within texts. However, most existing methods focus on short documents (up to 512 tokens), leaving a gap in processing long-context documents. In this paper, we introduce LongKey, a novel framework for extracting keyphrases from lengthy documents, which uses an encoder-based language model to capture extended text intricacies. LongKey uses a max-pooling embedder to enhance keyphrase candidate representation. Validated on the comprehensive LDKP datasets and six diverse, unseen datasets, LongKey consistently outperforms existing unsupervised and language model-based keyphrase extraction methods. Our findings demonstrate LongKey's versatility and superior performance, marking an advancement in keyphrase extraction for varied text lengths and domains.
