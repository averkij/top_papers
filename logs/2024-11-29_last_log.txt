Vision-language models~(VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.

Human motion generation plays a vital role in applications such as digital humans and humanoid robot control. However, most existing approaches disregard physics constraints, leading to the frequent production of physically implausible motions with pronounced artifacts such as floating and foot sliding. In this paper, we propose Morph, a Motion-free physics optimization framework, comprising a Motion Generator and a Motion Physics Refinement module, for enhancing physical plausibility without relying on costly real-world motion data. Specifically, the Motion Generator is responsible for providing large-scale synthetic motion data, while the Motion Physics Refinement Module utilizes these synthetic data to train a motion imitator within a physics simulator, enforcing physical constraints to project the noisy motions into a physically-plausible space. These physically refined motions, in turn, are used to fine-tune the Motion Generator, further enhancing its capability. Experiments on both text-to-motion and music-to-dance generation tasks demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art motion generation quality while improving physical plausibility drastically.
