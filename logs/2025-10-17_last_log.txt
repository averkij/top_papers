RAGCap-Bench evaluates intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows, highlighting the importance of enhancing these capabilities for better end-to-end performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that "slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) помогает LLM преодолевать ограничения, такие как фактические ошибки и галлюцинации, путём динамического извлечения внешней информации. Исследователи проанализировали современные системы, выявили типичные ошибки LLM и создали таксономию для целевой оценки промежуточных этапов работы. Эксперименты показали, что модели с более сильными результатами по RAGCap достигают лучшей итоговой производительности, что подтверждает важность развития этих промежуточных способностей.",

"RAGCap-Bench evaluates intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows, highlighting the importance of enhancing these capabilities for better end-to-end performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that "slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of enhancing these intermediate capabilities."
