Text:"VLA-0: Building State-of-the-Art VLAs with Zero Modification Ankit Goyal, Hugo Hadfield, Xuning Yang, Valts Blukis, Fabio Ramos NVIDIA 5 2 0 2 5 1 ] . [ 1 4 5 0 3 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r Abstract Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold immense promise for enabling generalist robot manipulation. However, the best way to build them remains an open question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the existing vocabulary of Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or introducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of representing actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This work introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only effective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0 outperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, popular benchmark for evaluating VLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data, including π0.5-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA. Furthermore, without large-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on large-scale robotic data, like π0.5-KI, π0, GR00TN1 and MolmoAct. These findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms SmolVLA, VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data. This paper summarizes our unexpected findings and spells out the specific techniques required to unlock the high performance of this simple yet potent VLA design. Visual results, code, and trained models are provided at: https://vla0.github.io/. I. INTRODUCTION Following the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text processing and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in handling both visual and textual inputs, natural next step is to explore Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), i.e. systems that not only understand visual and textual information, but also predict actions for robotic agents. VLAs are typically built by modifying base VLM to predict actions. However, it is still unclear what the correct way to do this "

[ 1 0 8 8 4 1 . 0 1 5 2 : r Fantastic (small) Retrievers and How to Train Them: mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 Tech Report Rikiya Takehi1,2*, Benjamin Clavié1, Sean Lee1, and Aamir Shakir1 1 Mixedbread AI 2 Waseda University {rikiya,ben,sean}@mixedbread.com Abstract. In this work, we introduce mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 models, at two different parameter counts: 17M and 32M. As part of our research, we conduct numerous experiments to improve retrieval and lateinteraction models, which we intend to distill into smaller models as proof-of-concepts. Our ultimate aim is to support retrieval at all scales, from large-scale retrieval which lives in the cloud to models that can run locally, on any device. mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 is model that we hope will serve as solid foundation backbone for all future experiments, representing the first version of long series of small proof-of-concepts. As part of the development of mxbai-edge-colbert-v0, we conducted multiple ablation studies, of which we report the results. In terms of downstream performance, mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 is particularly capable small model, outperforming ColBERTv2 on common short-text benchmarks (BEIR) and representing large step forward in long-context tasks, with unprecedented efficiency. In the last two years, neural Information Retrieval (IR) has experienced an unprecedented level of interest, owing in large part to the rapid development and deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the proven effectiveness of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines [13], where retrieval models are used to provide LLMs with useful context. As part of this wave, end-user interest in multi-vector retrieval methods, also called late interaction models or, more simply, ColBERT, after the model which initially introduced this method [11]. Where the dominant paradigm in neural IR, Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) [36], leverages single, large vector to represent documents, ColBERT models instead employ numerous smalle"

Elastic-Cache optimizes key-value cache management in diffusion large language models to reduce decoding latency without sacrificing prediction accuracy.  					AI-generated summary 				 This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant {bf MASK} tokens primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose {bf Elastic-Cache}, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that jointly decides {when} to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the most-attended token) and {where} to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent speedups: 8.7times on GSM8K (256 tokens), 45.1times on longer sequences, and 4.8times on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput (6.8times on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

BitNet Distillation fine-tunes large language models to 1.58-bit precision using SubLN, multi-head attention distillation, and continual pre-training, achieving comparable performance with significant memory and inference speed improvements.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into 1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs.

Misaligned tokenization in large language models for code leads to inconsistent model behavior, necessitating grammar-aware tokenization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 models, with 17M and 32M parameters, demonstrate superior retrieval performance on short-text and long-context benchmarks compared to ColBERTv2.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this work, we introduce mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 models, at two different parameter counts: 17M and 32M. As part of our research, we conduct numerous experiments to improve retrieval and late-interaction models, which we intend to distill into smaller models as proof-of-concepts. Our ultimate aim is to support retrieval at all scales, from large-scale retrieval which lives in the cloud to models that can run locally, on any device. mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 is a model that we hope will serve as a solid foundation backbone for all future experiments, representing the first version of a long series of small proof-of-concepts. As part of the development of mxbai-edge-colbert-v0, we conducted multiple ablation studies, of which we report the results. In terms of downstream performance, mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 is a particularly capable small model, outperforming ColBERTv2 on common short-text benchmarks (BEIR) and representing a large step forward in long-context tasks, with unprecedented efficiency.
