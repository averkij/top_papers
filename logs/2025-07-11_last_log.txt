Text:"RE-BOTTLENECK: LATENT RE-STRUCTURING FOR NEURAL AUDIO AUTOENCODERS Dimitrios Bralios1 Jonah Casebeer2 Paris Smaragdis1 1 University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign 2 Adobe Research 5 2 0 2 0 1 ] . [ 1 7 6 8 7 0 . 7 0 5 2 : r ABSTRACT Neural audio codecs and autoencoders have emerged as versatile models for audio compression, transmission, feature-extraction, and latent-space generation. However, key limitation is that most are trained to maximize reconstruction fidelity, often neglecting the specific latent structure necessary for optimal performance in diverse downstream applications. We propose simple, post-hoc framework to address this by modifying the bottleneck of pre-trained autoencoder. Our method introduces Re-Bottleneck, an inner bottleneck trained exclusively through latent space losses to instill userdefined structure. We demonstrate the frameworks effectiveness in three experiments. First, we enforce an ordering on latent channels without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Second, we align latents with semantic embeddings, analyzing the impact on downstream diffusion modeling. Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that filtering operation on the input waveform directly corresponds to specific transformation in the latent space. Ultimately, our ReBottleneck framework offers flexible and efficient way to tailor representations of neural audio models, enabling them to seamlessly meet the varied demands of different applications with minimal additional training. Index Terms autoencoders, latent modeling, structured latent spaces, equivariance, generative modeling 1. INTRODUCTION Neural audio autoencoders and codecs have become foundational in modern audio processing, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction from compact latent representations [1, 2, 3, 4]. These models are powerful components, driving innovation in areas like audio generation via next-token prediction [5, 6, 7], latent diffusion [4] and supporting tasks such as classification, enhancement, a"

Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that a filtering operation on the input waveform directly corresponds to a specific transformation in the latent space. Ultimately, our Re-Bottleneck framework offers a flexible and efficient way to tailor representations of neural audio models, enabling them to seamlessly meet the varied demands of different applications with minimal additional training.

"A Re-Bottleneck framework modifies pre-trained autoencoders to enforce specific latent structures, improving performance in diverse downstream applications.  					AI-generated summary 				 Neural audio codecs and autoencoders have emerged as versatile models for audio compression, transmission, feature-extraction, and latent-space generation. However, a key limitation is that most are trained to maximize reconstruction fidelity, often neglecting the specific latent structure necessary for optimal performance in diverse downstream applications. We propose a simple, post-hoc framework to address this by modifying the bottleneck of a pre-trained autoencoder. Our method introduces a "Re-Bottleneck", an inner bottleneck trained exclusively through latent space losses to instill user-defined structure. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in three experiments. First, we enforce an ordering on latent channels without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Second, we align latents with semantic embeddings, analyzing the impact on downstream diffusion modeling. Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that a filtering operation on the input waveform directly corresponds to a specific transformation in the latent space.
