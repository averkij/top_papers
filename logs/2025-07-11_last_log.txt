LangSplatV2 enhances 3D text querying speed and accuracy by replacing the heavyweight decoder with a sparse coefficient field and efficient CUDA optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 In this paper, we introduce LangSplatV2, which achieves high-dimensional feature splatting at 476.2 FPS and 3D open-vocabulary text querying at 384.6 FPS for high-resolution images, providing a 42 times speedup and a 47 times boost over LangSplat respectively, along with improved query accuracy. LangSplat employs Gaussian Splatting to embed 2D CLIP language features into 3D, significantly enhancing speed and learning a precise 3D language field with SAM semantics. Such advancements in 3D language fields are crucial for applications that require language interaction within complex scenes. However, LangSplat does not yet achieve real-time inference performance (8.2 FPS), even with advanced A100 GPUs, severely limiting its broader application. In this paper, we first conduct a detailed time analysis of LangSplat, identifying the heavyweight decoder as the primary speed bottleneck. Our solution, LangSplatV2 assumes that each Gaussian acts as a sparse code within a global dictionary, leading to the learning of a 3D sparse coefficient field that entirely eliminates the need for a heavyweight decoder. By leveraging this sparsity, we further propose an efficient sparse coefficient splatting method with CUDA optimization, rendering high-dimensional feature maps at high quality while incurring only the time cost of splatting an ultra-low-dimensional feature. Our experimental results demonstrate that LangSplatV2 not only achieves better or competitive query accuracy but is also significantly faster.

Machine bullshit, characterized by LLMs' indifference to truth, is quantified and analyzed through a new framework, revealing that RLHF and CoT prompting exacerbate certain bullshit forms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit: empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms, particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.
