Jianzhu Yao1, Kevin Wang2, Ryan Hsieh2, Haisu Zhou2, Tianqing Zou2, Zerui Cheng1, Zhangyang Wang2, Pramod Viswanath1 1Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Princeton University, New Jersey, US 2Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, US {jy0246, pramodv}@princeton.edu {kevinwang.1839,atlaswang}@utexas.edu * Equal contribution. Website: https://spinbench.github.io Abstract Reasoning and strategic behavior in social interactions is hallmark of intelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation (SPIN-Bench), new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multihop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination un"

Reasoning and strategic behavior in social interactions is a hallmark of intelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming.

SPIN-Bench систематически варьирует пространства действий, сложность состояний и количество взаимодействующих агентов для симуляции различных социальных ситуаций. Эксперименты показывают, что современные языковые модели справляются с базовым извлечением фактов и краткосрочным планированием, но испытывают трудности с задачами, требующими глубокого многоступенчатого рассуждения и социально адаптивной координации в условиях неопределенности.",
