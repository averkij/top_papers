II) CHOrD can be conditioned on complex floor plan structures to generate realistic house-wide layouts while ensuring physically plausible, spatially coherent, and collision-free arrangements. It further introduces hierarchical data structure that organizes objects not only at the room level but also at finer scales, such as desks and coffee tables. III, IV) CHOrD supports controllable floor plans via multimodal inputs, as well as photorealistic, 3Dconsistent rendering. These capabilities equip CHOrD with considerable versatility, enabling broad range of downstream applications. "

We introduce CHOrD, a novel framework for scalable synthesis of 3D indoor scenes, designed to create house-scale, collision-free, and hierarchically structured indoor digital twins. In contrast to existing methods that directly synthesize the scene layout as a scene graph or object list, CHOrD incorporates a 2D image-based intermediate layout representation, enabling effective prevention of collision artifacts by successfully capturing them as out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios during generation. Furthermore, unlike existing methods, CHOrD is capable of generating scene layouts that adhere to complex floor plans with multi-modal controls, enabling the creation of coherent, house-wide layouts robust to both geometric and semantic variations in room structures. Additionally, we propose a novel dataset with expanded coverage of household items and room configurations, as well as significantly improved data quality. CHOrD demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the 3D-FRONT and our proposed datasets, delivering photorealistic, spatially coherent indoor scene synthesis adaptable to arbitrary floor plan variations.
