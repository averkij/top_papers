Text:"2025-3-18 NVIDIAVideo Foundation Models (VFMs) have recently been used to simulate the real world to train physical AI systems and develop creative visual experiences. However, there are significant challenges in training large-scale, high quality VFMs that can generate high-quality videos. We present scalable, open-source VFM training pipeline with NVIDIA NeMo, providing accelerated video dataset curation, multimodal dataloading, and parallelized video diffusion model training and inference. We also provide comprehensive performance analysis highlighting best practices for efficient VFM training and inference. 1. Introduction The evolution of generative AI has moved beyond text-based models with new multimodal models. These models can now handle tasks like image generation, captioning, and visual question-answering, signaling progression towards AI systems that can interact with humans across various modalities. Recently, the focus has shifted from text and images to video, unlocking new potential applications across various industries. Video Foundation Models (VFMs) will revolutionize several industries including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and entertainment. Building VFMs comes with unique challenges due to the scale and diversity of video data. Training VFMs requires scalable training pipelines that can ingest large amounts of data and train model capable of understanding temporal and spatial dynamics to simulate the world. In this paper, we present scalable framework for VFM training with NVIDIA NeMo. Our end-to-end training framework allows users to create or fine-tune their own VFMs. We provide high-throughput data curation with NeMo Curator, efficient multimodal data loading functionality through Megatron Energon, scalable diffusion model training leveraging Megatron Core, and parallelized video generation pipeline in NeMo. 5 2 0 2 M 7 1 ] .

All rights reserved. Training Video Foundation Models with NVIDIA NeMo 2. High-Throughput Video Curation with NeMo Curator Training VFMs effectively requires internet-scale high-quality video data. NeMo Curator allows users to efficiently clip, annotate and filter 100PB+ of videos. To accomplish this, NeMo Curator provides two modular pipelines that can ingest raw videos and output high quality VFM training / fine-tuning datasets. Each pipeline is composed of sequence of stages, where each stage performs step in the curation process. The modularity of these pipelines allows users to customize different parts of the data curation process with custom models. Figure 2: Video Curation Pipeline. The video curation pipeline clips and processes large amounts of raw video. Then, the clips are sharded and stored on the cloud in the Webdataset format. 2.1. Clipping Pipeline The clipping pipeline takes as input raw, uncurated videos and outputs short, continuous (no jump-cuts or other transitions) clips with associated metadata. It uses an aggressive method of splitting clips, analyzing the color changes between frames, which is smoothed out by computing the similarity between image embeddings of adjacent clips to potentially merge them back together. These clips are then transcoded to the high-quality video encoding (H264), and they are annotated with video embeddings to facilitate semantic search capabilities. We can create synthetic captions from VLM when no caption for the video has been provided, which has been shown to improve the quality of the downstream model over pre-written captions (Sharifzadeh et al., 2024). After this pipeline, it is recommended that users manually inspect the generated captions to verify their quality and make any alterations as they see fit. 2.2. Sharding Pipeline Sharding generates text embeddings for captions and creates the final WebDataset used for training. WebDataset divides large datasets into smaller, manageable shards. This division facilitates parallel data access and processing, allowing multiple GPUs to handle different shards concurrently. This is especially necessary when training VFM on thousands of GPUs with petabyte-scale multimodal data. The sharding pipeline splits the data into different POSIX tar archive files. During training, these tar files can be accessed with purely sequential read operations, which can signifcantly boost I/O performance from cloud storage solutions. 2.3. Pipeline Optimizations The pipelines in NeMo Curator are built to scale to hundreds of nodes while running at maximum throughput. To perform effectively at scale, we use GPU acceleration in all stages of our pipelines and leverage Ray (Moritz 2 Training Video Foundation Models with NVIDIA NeMo et al., 2018) to automatically scale the number of workers per stage to balance the throughput. Beyond running the model inference on GPUs, we found that utilizing the hardware video decoder (NVDEC) and hardware video encoder (NVENC) on NVIDIA GPUs brought 3x speedup in the decoding and transcoding stages. Since each of the stages has different throughput, it is easy to be limited by the stage with the lowest throughput. For example, in the clipping pipeline, we use different models for generating video embeddings and video captions. Video captions are generated with vision-language models that can have several billions of parameters. On the other hand, video embeddings are generated with models much smaller, around few hundred million parameters in size. In this case, the video captioning model has much lower throughput than the video embedding model and would be rate-limiting stage in the pipeline. Performing inference with these models without wasting GPU cycles requires system to balance the workloads automatically. To solve this, we built an auto-balancing system as shown in Figure 3 that will deploy an optimal number of workers for each stage in the pipeline. This causes lower throughput stages to end up with more workers to keep pace with the higher throughput stages. As seen in Figure 3, we can achieve significant speedups across the overall pipeline by leveraging our auto-balancing system along with Ray for streaming d"
