Text:"Rewards Are Enough for Fast Photo-Realistic Text-to-image Generation Yihong Luo * 1 Tianyang Hu * 2 Weijian Luo 3 Kenji Kawaguchi 2 Jing Tang 4 1 5 2 0 2 7 1 ] . [ 1 0 7 0 3 1 . 3 0 5 2 : r Abstract Aligning generated images to complicated text prompts and human preferences is central challenge in Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC). With reward-enhanced diffusion distillation emerging as promising approach that boosts controllability and fidelity of text-to-image models, we identify fundamental paradigm shift: as conditions become more specific and reward signals stronger, the rewards themselves become the dominant force in generation. In contrast, the diffusion losses serve as an overly expensive form of regularization. To thoroughly validate our hypothesis, we introduce R0, novel conditional generation approach via regularized reward maximization. Instead of relying on tricky diffusion distillation losses, R0 proposes new perspective that treats image generations as an optimization problem in data space which aims to search for valid images that have high compositional rewards. By innovative designs of the generator parameterization and proper regularization techniques, we train state-of-the-art few-step text-to-image generative models with R0 at scales. Our results challenge the conventional wisdom of diffusion post-training and conditional generation by demonstrating that rewards play dominant role in scenarios with complex conditions. We hope our findings can contribute to further research into human-centric and reward-centric generation paradigms across the broader field of AIGC. Code is available at https://github. com/Luo-Yihong/R0. 1. Introduction Thanks to their superb training stability and scalability, diffusion models (Song et al., 2020b; Ho et al., 2020; SohlDickstein et al., 2015) have become the dominating force *Equal contribution 4HKUST (GZ).

[ 1 2 1 4 1 1 . 3 0 5 2 : r Fig. 1. MTV-Inpaint is unified video inpainting framework that supports multiple tasks, such as text/image-guided object insertion, scene completion, and derived applications like object editing and removal. It is also capable of handling long videos with hundreds of frames. Video inpainting involves modifying local regions within video, ensuring spatial and temporal consistency. Most existing methods focus primarily on scene completion (i.e., filling missing regions) and lack the capability to insert new objects into scene in controllable manner. Fortunately, recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models pave the way for text-guided video inpainting. However, directly adapting T2V models for inpainting remains limited in unifying completion and insertion tasks, lacks input controllability, and struggles with long videos, thereby restricting their applicability and flexibility. To address these challenges, we propose MTVInpaint, multi-task video inpainting framework capable of handling both traditional scene completion and novel object insertion tasks.

However, theoretical analyses of these models remain scant. In this work, we develop theoretical underpinnings for these models and use our insights to improve the performance of existing models. We first develop Meta-ARVDM, unified framework of ARVDMs that subsumes most existing methods. Using Meta-ARVDM, we analyze the KL-divergence between the videos generated by Meta-ARVDM and the true videos. Our analysis uncovers two important phenomena inherent to ARVDMerror accumulation and memory bottleneck. By deriving an information-theoretic impossibility result, we show that the memory bottleneck phenomenon cannot be avoided. To mitigate the memory bottleneck, we design various network structures to explicitly use more past frames. We also achieve significantly improved trade-off between the mitigation of the memory bottleneck and the inference efficiency by compressing the frames. Experimental results on DMLab and Minecraft validate the efficacy of our methods. Our experiments also demonstrate Pareto-frontier between the error accumulation and memory bottleneck across different methods. The project webpage is https://sail-sg.github.io/AR-Video-Diffusion. The Video Diffusion Model (VDM) has achieved tremendous successes in generating highquality and temporally coherent videos (Xing et al., 2024; Ho et al., 2022b).

Aligning generated images to complicated text prompts and human preferences is a central challenge in Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC). With reward-enhanced diffusion distillation emerging as a promising approach that boosts controllability and fidelity of text-to-image models, we identify a fundamental paradigm shift: as conditions become more specific and reward signals stronger, the rewards themselves become the dominant force in generation. In contrast, the diffusion losses serve as an overly expensive form of regularization. To thoroughly validate our hypothesis, we introduce R0, a novel conditional generation approach via regularized reward maximization. Instead of relying on tricky diffusion distillation losses, R0 proposes a new perspective that treats image generations as an optimization problem in data space which aims to search for valid images that have high compositional rewards. By innovative designs of the generator parameterization and proper regularization techniques, we train state-of-the-art few-step text-to-image generative models with R0 at scales. Our results challenge the conventional wisdom of diffusion post-training and conditional generation by demonstrating that rewards play a dominant role in scenarios with complex conditions. We hope our findings can contribute to further research into human-centric and reward-centric generation paradigms across the broader field of AIGC.

Video inpainting involves modifying local regions within a video, ensuring spatial and temporal consistency. Most existing methods focus primarily on scene completion (i.e., filling missing regions) and lack the capability to insert new objects into a scene in a controllable manner. Fortunately, recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models pave the way for text-guided video inpainting. However, directly adapting T2V models for inpainting remains limited in unifying completion and insertion tasks, lacks input controllability, and struggles with long videos, thereby restricting their applicability and flexibility. To address these challenges, we propose MTV-Inpaint, a unified multi-task video inpainting framework capable of handling both traditional scene completion and novel object insertion tasks. To unify these distinct tasks, we design a dual-branch spatial attention mechanism in the T2V diffusion U-Net, enabling seamless integration of scene completion and object insertion within a single framework. In addition to textual guidance, MTV-Inpaint supports multimodal control by integrating various image inpainting models through our proposed image-to-video (I2V) inpainting mode. Additionally, we propose a two-stage pipeline that combines keyframe inpainting with in-between frame propagation, enabling MTV-Inpaint to effectively handle long videos with hundreds of frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV-Inpaint achieves state-of-the-art performance in both scene completion and object insertion tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates versatility in derived applications such as multi-modal inpainting, object editing, removal, image object brush, and the ability to handle long videos.

A variety of Auto-Regressive Video Diffusion Models (ARVDM) have achieved remarkable successes in generating realistic long-form videos. However, theoretical analyses of these models remain scant. In this work, we develop theoretical underpinnings for these models and use our insights to improve the performance of existing models. We first develop Meta-ARVDM, a unified framework of ARVDMs that subsumes most existing methods. Using Meta-ARVDM, we analyze the KL-divergence between the videos generated by Meta-ARVDM and the true videos. Our analysis uncovers two important phenomena inherent to ARVDM -- error accumulation and memory bottleneck. By deriving an information-theoretic impossibility result, we show that the memory bottleneck phenomenon cannot be avoided. To mitigate the memory bottleneck, we design various network structures to explicitly use more past frames. We also achieve a significantly improved trade-off between the mitigation of the memory bottleneck and the inference efficiency by compressing the frames. Experimental results on DMLab and Minecraft validate the efficacy of our methods. Our experiments also demonstrate a Pareto-frontier between the error accumulation and memory bottleneck across different methods.
