The FM handles high-level cognitive tasks such as instruction understanding, task planning, and reasoning, while the skill library provides stable locomotion and dexterous manipulation for low-level control.

The Connector enhances the FMs embodied capabilities by translating language-based plans into actionable skill commands and dynamically coordinating locomotion and manipulation to improve task success.

Introduction In the evolving field of embodied AI, humanoid robots represent an ideal platform for achieving human-level intelligence, enabling physical interactions with the real world in ways akin to humans. To realize the ultimate goal of allowing humanoid robots to autonomously perform tasks like humans, current research primarily focuses on improving individual skills, including locomotion (Radosavovic et al., 2024; Zhuang et al., 2024), bimanual manipulation (Ze et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024a; Zhou et al., 2024), and whole-body control (He et al., 2024a; Fu et al., 2024a). However, building fully autonomous agents for humanoid robots remains significant and largely unexplored challenge. An autonomous robotic agent must solve diverse embodied tasks in the real world by grounding language instructions into feasible plans and reliably stitching skills to accomplish long-horizon tasks. Recent studies (Firoozi et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2023) in robotic agents have integrated Foundation Models (FMs) with learning-based robotic skills, leveraging FMs capabilities in general-purpose vision-language understanding for skill planning (Ahn et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2024), success detection (Huang et al., 2022), and reasoning. While these methods have achieved some success in building agents for robot arms (Liang et al., 2023), wheeled robots (Ahn et al., 2022), and quadruped robots (Chen et al., 2024), can the same success be replicated for humanoid robots? In this paper, we introduce Being-0, hierarchical agent framework designed for humanoid robots. We begin by equipping universal FM-based agent framework (Tan et al., 2024) with modular robotic skill library. This skill library includes robust locomotion skill based on joystick commands and set of manipulation skills with language descriptions, acquired through state-of-the-art teleoperation (Cheng et al., 2024b) and imitation learning (Zhao et al., 2023) methods. These skills enable the robot to walk and manipulate objects in response to language commands. In principle, the FM agent could call these skills based on image observations in closed-loop manner to solve long-horizon tasks. However, we find that humanoid robots introduce unique challenges for such system. Unlike wheeled robots, which can precisely follow planned navigation trajectories and stop at specific positions for object manipulation, humanoid robots face inherent instability in bipedal locomotion. This instability necessitates frequent adjustments to locomotion commands for error correction. However, existing FMs, such as GPT-4o, suffer from limitations in inference efficiency and embodied scene understanding, making humanoid agents less reactive and robust during the alternating phases of navigation and manipulation in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose novel Connector module, which serves as an intermediate layer between the FM and skill library in Being-0. The Connector generates real-time commands for both locomotion and manipulation skills based on the FMs language plan and visual observations. We model the Connector as vision-language model (VLM) and train it using first-person images of indoor navigation annotated with language instructions, object labels, and bounding boxes. This training scheme distills embodied knowledge from vision-language navigation data into the lightweight VLM-based Connector, enabling accurate skill planning and efficient navigation at higher control frequency. Furthermore, to seamlessly stitch navigation and manipulation skills, the Connector can send locomotion commands to adjust the humanoids pose, improving the initialization state for subsequent manipulation tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on navigation, manipulation, and long-horizon tasks using full-sized humanoid robot equipped with dexterous hands and an active camera. The results demonstra"

Text:"reWordBench: Benchmarking and Improving the Robustness of Reward Models with Transformed Inputs (cid:229),(cid:227), Michihiro Yasunaga (cid:229) (cid:229), Andrew Cohen (cid:229), Yoon Kim (cid:227), Asli Celikyilmaz (cid:229), Marjan Zhaofeng Wu Ghazvininejad (cid:229)FAIR at Meta, (cid:227)MIT Work done at Meta Reward models have become staple in modern NLP, serving as not only scalable text evaluator, but also an indispensable component in many alignment recipes and inference-time algorithms. However, while recent reward models increase performance on standard benchmarks, this may partly be due to overfitting effects, which would confound an understanding of their true capability. In this work, we scrutinize the robustness of reward models and the extent of such overfitting. We build reWordBench, which systematically transforms reward model inputs in meaningor ranking-preserving ways. We show that state-of-the-art reward models suffer from substantial performance degradation even with minor input transformations, sometimes dropping to significantly below-random accuracy, suggesting brittleness. To improve reward model robustness, we propose to explicitly train them to assign similar scores to paraphrases, and find that this approach also improves robustness to other distinct kinds of transformations. For example, our robust reward model reduces such degradation by roughly half for the Chat Hard subset in RewardBench. Furthermore, when used in alignment, our robust reward models demonstrate better utility and lead to higher-quality outputs, winning in up to 59% of instances against standardly trained RM.

Building autonomous robotic agents capable of achieving human-level performance in real-world embodied tasks is an ultimate goal in humanoid robot research. Recent advances have made significant progress in high-level cognition with Foundation Models (FMs) and low-level skill development for humanoid robots. However, directly combining these components often results in poor robustness and efficiency due to compounding errors in long-horizon tasks and the varied latency of different modules. We introduce Being-0, a hierarchical agent framework that integrates an FM with a modular skill library. The FM handles high-level cognitive tasks such as instruction understanding, task planning, and reasoning, while the skill library provides stable locomotion and dexterous manipulation for low-level control. To bridge the gap between these levels, we propose a novel Connector module, powered by a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). The Connector enhances the FM's embodied capabilities by translating language-based plans into actionable skill commands and dynamically coordinating locomotion and manipulation to improve task success. With all components, except the FM, deployable on low-cost onboard computation devices, Being-0 achieves efficient, real-time performance on a full-sized humanoid robot equipped with dexterous hands and active vision. Extensive experiments in large indoor environments demonstrate Being-0's effectiveness in solving complex, long-horizon tasks that require challenging navigation and manipulation subtasks.

Reward models have become a staple in modern NLP, serving as not only a scalable text evaluator, but also an indispensable component in many alignment recipes and inference-time algorithms. However, while recent reward models increase performance on standard benchmarks, this may partly be due to overfitting effects, which would confound an understanding of their true capability. In this work, we scrutinize the robustness of reward models and the extent of such overfitting. We build **reWordBench**, which systematically transforms reward model inputs in meaning- or ranking-preserving ways. We show that state-of-the-art reward models suffer from substantial performance degradation even with minor input transformations, sometimes dropping to significantly below-random accuracy, suggesting brittleness. To improve reward model robustness, we propose to explicitly train them to assign similar scores to paraphrases, and find that this approach also improves robustness to other distinct kinds of transformations. For example, our robust reward model reduces such degradation by roughly half for the Chat Hard subset in RewardBench. Furthermore, when used in alignment, our robust reward models demonstrate better utility and lead to higher-quality outputs, winning in up to 59% of instances against a standardly trained RM.

Videos, with their unique temporal dimension, demand precise grounded understanding, where answers are directly linked to visual, interpretable evidence. Despite significant breakthroughs in reasoning capabilities within Large Language Models, multi-modal reasoning - especially for videos - remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoMind, a novel video-language agent designed for temporal-grounded video understanding. VideoMind incorporates two key innovations: (i) We identify essential capabilities for video temporal reasoning and develop a role-based agentic workflow, including a planner for coordinating different roles, a grounder for temporal localization, a verifier to assess temporal interval accuracy, and an answerer for question-answering. (ii) To efficiently integrate these diverse roles, we propose a novel Chain-of-LoRA strategy, enabling seamless role-switching via lightweight LoRA adaptors while avoiding the overhead of multiple models, thus balancing efficiency and flexibility. Extensive experiments on 14 public benchmarks demonstrate that our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse video understanding tasks, including 3 on grounded video question-answering, 6 on video temporal grounding, and 5 on general video question-answering, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing video agent and long-form temporal reasoning.

(ii) To efficiently integrate these diverse roles, we propose a novel Chain-of-LoRA strategy, enabling seamless role-switching via lightweight LoRA adaptors while avoiding the overhead of multiple models, thus balancing efficiency and flexibility. Extensive experiments on 14 public benchmarks demonstrate that our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse video understanding tasks, including 3 on grounded video question-answering, 6 on video temporal grounding, and 5 on general video question-answering, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing video agent and long-form temporal reasoning."

Recent studies generally enhance MLLMs' reasoning capabilities via supervised fine-tuning on high-quality chain-of-thought reasoning data, which often leads models to merely imitate successful reasoning paths without understanding what the wrong reasoning paths are. In this work, we aim to enhance the MLLMs' reasoning ability beyond passively imitating positive reasoning paths. To this end, we design Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (StepGRPO), a new online reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to self-improve reasoning ability via simple, effective and dense step-wise rewarding. Specifically, StepGRPO introduces two novel rule-based reasoning rewards: Step-wise Reasoning Accuracy Reward (StepRAR) and Step-wise Reasoning Validity Reward (StepRVR). StepRAR rewards the reasoning paths that contain necessary intermediate reasoning steps via a soft key-step matching technique, while StepRAR rewards reasoning paths that follow a well-structured and logically consistent reasoning process through a reasoning completeness and logic evaluation strategy. With the proposed StepGRPO, we introduce R1-VL, a series of MLLMs with outstanding capabilities in step-by-step reasoning. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our methods.

The field of psychology has long recognized a basic level of categorization that humans use when labeling visual stimuli, a term coined by Rosch in 1976. This level of categorization has been found to be used most frequently, to have higher information density, and to aid in visual language tasks with priming in humans. Here, we investigate basic level categorization in two recently released, open-source vision-language models (VLMs). This paper demonstrates that Llama 3.2 Vision Instruct (11B) and Molmo 7B-D both prefer basic level categorization consistent with human behavior. Moreover, the models' preferences are consistent with nuanced human behaviors like the biological versus non-biological basic level effects and the well established expert basic level shift, further suggesting that VLMs acquire cognitive categorization behaviors from the human data on which they are trained.

Recent work has sought to quantify large language model uncertainty to facilitate model control and modulate user trust. Previous works focus on measures of uncertainty that are theoretically grounded or reflect the average overt behavior of the model. In this work, we investigate a variety of uncertainty measures, in order to identify measures that correlate with human group-level uncertainty. We find that Bayesian measures and a variation on entropy measures, top-k entropy, tend to agree with human behavior as a function of model size. We find that some strong measures decrease in human-similarity with model size, but, by multiple linear regression, we find that combining multiple uncertainty measures provide comparable human-alignment with reduced size-dependency.
