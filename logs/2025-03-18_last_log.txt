Our key contributions include: 1) dual-branch diffusion architecture with hierarchical feature fusion for seamless foreground-background integration; 2) selfsupervised training paradigm with tailored data augmentation and score functions; and 3) controllable dropout strategies to balance fidelity and diversity. To support further research, we introduce BlobData for large-scale training and BlobBench for systematic evaluation. Experiments show that BlobCtrl excels in various element-level manipulation tasks while maintaining computational efficiency, offering practical solution for precise and flexible visual content creation. Project page: https://liyaowei-stu.github. io/project/BlobCtrl/. 1. Introduction Element-level image manipulation has long been goal in digital art, with tools like Adobe Photoshop(Adobe Inc., 19882023) enabling precise manipulation of visual elements. While recent AI models(Ramesh et al., 2022; Labs, 2023; Esser et al., 2024; Sheynin et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024) excel in high-quality image synthesis, they often lack fine-grained control over individual elementsa key feature of traditional tools (Adobe Inc., 19882023; Serif Europe Ltd., 20152023). Advances like ControlNet(Zhang et al., 2023a) and IP-Adapter(Ye et al., 2023) have improved controllability but still do not support interactive, multi-round, element-based manipulation (e.g., composition, resizing, arrangement) crucial for creative workflows. Challenges include: 1) decoupling and representation of visual elements, 2) continuous layout control, 3) preserving appearance and identity, 4) maintaining visual harmony, and 5) scarcity of large-scale paired training data for end-to-end training. Current efforts in element-level manipulation focus on two approaches: generation and editing, each facing obstacles. Element-level generation(Li et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023; Nie et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024; Parmar et al., 2025) uses grounding tokens (e.g., bounding boxes, ellipses) for spatial control and identity tokens like CLIP(Radford et al., 2021) and DINO (Caron et al., 2021) for appearance maintenance. These methods struggle with continuous layout control due to the discrete nature of grounding tokens and the high compression of identity tokens, which hinders detailed appearance preservation. Element-level editing (Zhang et al., 2023b; Avrahami et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Alzayer et al., 2024; Mu et al., 2025) employs optimization, segmentation, clustering, and dragbased methods for attribute control. These approaches often lack flexibility and struggle with visual harmony, frequently relying on video data that introduces complexities like cam2 era movements, degrading performance and generalization. Detailed discussions of related research works are provided in Section 5. The essence of element-level visual modeling lies in the flexible decoupling and representation of location, semantics, and identity. BlobCtrl uses blobs as visual primitives to achieve this. Formally, blob is probabilistic twodimensional Gaussian distribution(Carson et al., 1999), and geometrically, it appears as an ellipse(Nie et al., 2024). Blob parameters precisely specify position, size, and orientation, while Gaussian smoothness ensures harmonious and continuous layout control. For visual identity, we use differentiable blob splatting(Epstein et al., 2022) combined with variational autoencoder (VAE) features(Kingma, 2013) to preserve appearance. Building on the probabilistic blob representation, we introduce dual-branch diffusion model: one branch for foreground elements and another for background elements. self-supervised training paradigm enhances generalization and efficiency, with specific strategies improving BlobCtrls robustness. To preserve foreground identities, we propose random data augmentation and an ID retention score function. Additionally, random dropout in the dual-branch structure allows flexible balancing of appearance fidelity and creative diversity during inference. These design choices make BlobCtrl an efficient, flexible solution for elementlevel generation and editing. To scale up our method and ensure comprehensive evaluation, we introduce new training dataset, BlobData, and benchmark, BlobBench. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate BlobCtrls effectiveness in elementlevel generation (combining multiple subjects) and editing (moving, resizing, adding, deleting, and replacing elements). In nutshell, our main contributions include: We propose BlobCtrl, novel unified framework that first enables precise and flexible manipulation over visual elements through element-level generation and editing, while effectively preserving their intrinsic characteristics. We design an innovative dual-branch architecture with meticulously crafted training paradigms and strategies, achieving an optimal balance between maintaining appearance fidelity and enabling creative diversity in"

Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The DropletVideo dataset and model are accessible at https://dropletx.github.io.

Element-level visual manipulation is essential in digital content creation, but current diffusion-based methods lack the precision and flexibility of traditional tools. In this work, we introduce BlobCtrl, a framework that unifies element-level generation and editing using a probabilistic blob-based representation. By employing blobs as visual primitives, our approach effectively decouples and represents spatial location, semantic content, and identity information, enabling precise element-level manipulation. Our key contributions include: 1) a dual-branch diffusion architecture with hierarchical feature fusion for seamless foreground-background integration; 2) a self-supervised training paradigm with tailored data augmentation and score functions; and 3) controllable dropout strategies to balance fidelity and diversity. To support further research, we introduce BlobData for large-scale training and BlobBench for systematic evaluation. Experiments show that BlobCtrl excels in various element-level manipulation tasks while maintaining computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for precise and flexible visual content creation.
