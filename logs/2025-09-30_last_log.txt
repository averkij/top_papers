Text:"5 2 0 2 6 2 ] . [ 1 3 9 1 2 2 . 9 0 5 2 : r WHEN DOES REASONING MATTER? CONTROLLED STUDY OF REASONINGS CONTRIBUTION TO MODEL PERFORMANCE. Nicolas Boizard1,5 Hippolyte Gisserot-Boukhlef2,5 Kevin El Haddad1,4 Celine Hudelot Pierre Colombo3,5 1Diabolocom 2Artefact Research Center 5MICS, CentraleSupelec, Universite Paris-Saclay 3Equall 4ISIA Lab, University of Mons Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have achieved state-of-the-art performance on wide range of tasks. Despite its empirical success, the tasks and model scales at which reasoning becomes effective, as well as its training and inference costs, remain underexplored. In this work, we rely on synthetic data distillation framework to conduct large-scale supervised study. We compare Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models of varying sizes, on wide range of math-centric and general-purpose tasks, evaluating both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our analysis reveals that reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Notably, while IFT remains Pareto-optimal in training and inference costs, reasoning models become increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks. Correspondence: nicolas.boizard@centralesupelec.fr Website: https://huggingface.co/when-does-reasoning-matter Date: September 26, Large Language Models (LLMs) that generate explicit Chains of Thought (CoT) have rapidly become defining paradigm. The research community is releasing increasingly capable reasoning models, which consistently outperform standard Instruction Fine-Tuned (IFT) counterparts at test time, especially on math, coding, and other reasoning-heavy tasks DeepSeek-AI (2025); OpenAI (2024); Mistral-AI (2025). Despite rapid progress, we still lack clarity on when explicit reasoning is most beneficial. Both prior evidence and our findings (Figure 1) point to highly task"

This shift has transformed research goals and priorities, from Lexical and Semantic Resources to Language Modelling and Multimodality. In this study, we track the research trends of the Italian CL and NLP community through an analysis of the contributions to CLiC-it, arguably the leading Italian conference in the field. We compile the proceedings from the first 10 editions of the CLiC-it conference (from 2014 to 2024) into the CLiC-it Corpus, providing comprehensive analysis of both its metadata, including author provenance, gender, affiliations, and more, as well as the content of the papers themselves, which address various topics. Our goal is to provide the Italian and international research communities with valuable insights into emerging trends and key developments over time, supporting informed decisions and future directions "

Reasoning models enhance performance across various tasks, surpassing instruction fine-tuned models in reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks, despite higher computational costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. Despite its empirical success, the tasks and model scales at which reasoning becomes effective, as well as its training and inference costs, remain underexplored. In this work, we rely on a synthetic data distillation framework to conduct a large-scale supervised study. We compare Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models of varying sizes, on a wide range of math-centric and general-purpose tasks, evaluating both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our analysis reveals that reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Notably, while IFT remains Pareto-optimal in training and inference costs, reasoning models become increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks.

"Reasoning models enhance performance across various tasks, surpassing instruction fine-tuned models in reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks, despite higher computational costs.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. Despite its empirical success, the tasks and model scales at which reasoning becomes effective, as well as its training and inference costs, remain underexplored. In this work, we rely on a synthetic data distillation framework to conduct a large-scale supervised study. We compare Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models of varying sizes, on a wide range of math-centric and general-purpose tasks, evaluating both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our analysis reveals that reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Notably, while IFT remains Pareto-optimal in training and inference costs, reasoning models become increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks."

The study analyzes research trends in Italian Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing by compiling and examining the proceedings of the CLiC-it conference from 2014 to 2024.  					AI-generated summary 				 Over the past decade, Computational Linguistics (CL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have evolved rapidly, especially with the advent of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift has transformed research goals and priorities, from Lexical and Semantic Resources to Language Modelling and Multimodality. In this study, we track the research trends of the Italian CL and NLP community through an analysis of the contributions to CLiC-it, arguably the leading Italian conference in the field. We compile the proceedings from the first 10 editions of the CLiC-it conference (from 2014 to 2024) into the CLiC-it Corpus, providing a comprehensive analysis of both its metadata, including author provenance, gender, affiliations, and more, as well as the content of the papers themselves, which address various topics. Our goal is to provide the Italian and international research communities with valuable insights into emerging trends and key developments over time, supporting informed decisions and future directions in the field.
