Text:"5 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 1 7 1 3 4 2 . 9 0 5 2 : r Rethinking JEPA: Compute-Efficient Video SSL with Frozen Teachers Xianhang Li, Chen Huang, Chun-Liang Li, Eran Malach, Josh Susskind, Vimal Thilak, Etai Littwin Apple Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show that frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train target encoder with simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze it and train student to predict the teachers latents on masked regions. This leads to two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT (Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student), increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically, our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPAs accuracyFLOPs Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal teachers. This points to compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly favor the student. These results position SALT as simple, scalable, and compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video representation learning.

Text:"5 2 0 2 3 2 ] . [ 1 2 8 5 8 1 . 9 0 5 2 : r The Photographers Eye: Teaching Multimodal Large Language Models to See and Critique like Photographers Daiqing Qi1,2, Handong Zhao2, Jing Shi2, Simon Jenni2, Yifei Fan2 Franck Dernoncourt2, Scott Cohen2, Sheng Li1 1University of Virginia, 2Adobe Figure 1. Examples on our model (PhotoEye), existing MLLMs tailored for low-level vision or aesthetics, and GPT-4o (202408-06). The left example and the middle top example highlight notable limitation of existing open-source MLLMs for low-level vision and aesthetics: insufficient coverage of visual aesthetics. When they fail to identify issues, they either provide positive aspects or claim there are no issues, significantly limiting their usefulness in real-world scenarios. The middle bottom example shows existing MLLMs lack of expertise in photography: lowering exposure properly can instead enhance colors of objects, so is correct. While other models, including GPT-4o, made mistakes, our model is correct. The right example reveals another clear limitation of existing open-source MLLMs: their vision encoders are insensitive to low-level vision and aesthetics. In series of increasingly overexposed photos (2-nd, 3-rd, and 4-th), PhotoEyes vision modules, more attuned to low-level and aesthetic features, identified overexposure by the 2-nd photo, while other models recognized it only when the photos were severely overexposed (i.e., 3-rd and 4-th images). High-quality aesthetic content is highlighted. "

SALT, a two-stage training method using a frozen teacher, achieves better video representation learning with higher efficiency and scalability compared to EMA-based approaches.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT (Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student), increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically, our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video representation learning.

A novel dataset and model enhance the aesthetic understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models by leveraging professional insights and multi-view vision fusion.  					AI-generated summary 				 While editing directly from life, photographers have found it too difficult to see simultaneously both the blue and the sky. Photographer and curator, Szarkowski insightfully revealed one of the notable gaps between general and aesthetic visual understanding: while the former focuses on identifying the factual element in an image (sky), the latter transcends such object identification, viewing it instead as an aesthetic component--a pure color block (blue). Such fundamental distinctions between general (detection, localization, etc.) and aesthetic (color, lighting, composition, etc.) visual understanding present a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although some recent works have made initial explorations, they are often limited to general and basic aesthetic commonsense. As a result, they frequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive expertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing knowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To fundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce a novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among professional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large scale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from PhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a languageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image aesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark, PhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual understanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates clear advantages over existing models.
