Text:"5 2 0 2 8 2 ] . [ 1 1 5 9 3 2 . 9 0 5 2 : r HunyuanImage 3.0 Technical Report Tencent Hunyuan Foundation Model TeamWe present HunyuanImage 3.0, native multimodal model that unifies multimodal understanding and generation within an autoregressive framework, with its image generation module publicly available. The achievement of HunyuanImage 3.0 relies on several key components, including meticulous data curation, advanced architecture design, native Chain-of-Thoughts schema, progressive model pretraining, aggressive model post-training, and an efficient infrastructure that enables large-scale training and inference. With these advancements, we successfully trained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model comprising over 80 billion parameters in total, with 13 billion parameters activated per token during inference, making it the largest and most powerful open-source image generative model to date. We conducted extensive experiments and the results of automatic and human evaluation of text-image alignment and visual quality demonstrate that HunyuanImage 3.0 rivals previous state-of-the-art models. By releasing the code and weights of HunyuanImage 3.0, we aim to enable the community to explore new ideas with state-of-the-art foundation model, fostering dynamic and vibrant multimodal ecosystem. All open source assets are publicly available at here.In recent years, image generation models have achieved remarkable progress, enabling the generation of realistic and diverse images from natural language descriptions and reference images. Advances in deep learning architectures, particularly diffusion models [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and transformerbased frameworks [11, 12], have significantly improved image fidelity and semantic alignment with input texts. Leading models such as Seedream 4.0 [13], Nano Banana [14], GPT-Image [15], QwenImage [16] and HunyuanImage 2.1 [17] have demonstrated the capability to synthesize complex scenes and artistic styles or edit image accurately, attracting widespread attention in both research and industry. However, these state-of-the-art systems are predominantly closed-source, limiting transparency and reproducibility for the wider research community. For this reason, we present HunyuanImage 3.0, an open-source model that achieves image generation performance comparable to, or surpassing, that of leading closed-source models. HunyuanImage 3.0 originates from our internally developed native multimodal model, currently with fine-tuning and post-training focused solely on image generation. We employ Hunyuan-A13B [18], pre-trained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model (LLM) with over 80 billion total parameters, of which 13 billion are activated per token during inference, as our base model. The choice reconciles the need for both high model capacity and computational efficiency. To extend the LLM to handle visual inputs for image understanding and generation, we augment it with pre-trained vision encoder and VAE, each equipped with projection layer that transforms the extracted image features into joint embedding space compatible with the LLMs word embeddings [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. For image understanding, the LLM conditions its autoregressive next-token prediction on joint image features extracted from the vision encoder and the VAE to generate appropriate responses. For image generation, diffusion-based image modeling on VAE image features is incorporated into the LLM in the same manner as in Transfusion [22] and JanusFlow [23]. Furthermore, the LLM-based framework enables us to incorporate Chain-of-Thought training and inference, thereby improving the performance of both image understanding and generation tasks. After fine-tuning and post-training Figure 1: Multi-ratio text-to-image samples from HunyuanImage 3.0, demonstrating its powerful prompt-following, reasoning, concept generalization and text-rendering capabilities. 2 the pre-trained model solely on image generation tasks, we establish the image generation module of HunyuanImage 3.0, which currently stands as the largest and most powerful open-source image generation model. We conduct extensive experiments on both automatic and human evaluation, the results on text-image alignment and visual quality demonstrate that HunyuanImage 3.0 rivals previous state-of-the-art models, including Seedream 4.0 [13], Nano Banana [14], GPT-Image [15] and HunyuanImage 2.1 [17]. By releasing the code and weights of HunyuanImage 3.0, we aim to enable the community to explore new ideas with state-of-the-art foundation model, fostering dynamic and vibrant image generation ecosystem. This report is structured as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our data preparation techniques, including filtering and captioning models. Section 3 presents detailed information about the architecture and algorithms of HunyuanImage 3.0. In Section 4, we discuss our training strategies and algorithms. In Section 5, we evaluate the performance of HunyuanImage 3.0 and compare it with state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models.2.1 Data Filtering To construct diverse, high-quality image dataset, we implemented comprehensive three-stage filtering process on an initial pool of over 10 billion raw images. This rigorous process, which ultimately retained less than 45% of the initial data, was designed to prioritize both semantic diversity and image quality, critical requirements for training robust generative models. In the first stage, we addressed technical flaws by removing images with low resolution (less than 512 pixels), broken files, over-/under-exposure, and over-saturation. We also deduplicated the images according to their MD5 values. The second stage served as our primary data curation process, employing two types of operators: objective filters and subject-scoring operators. The objective filters were learning-based detectors for watermarks, logos, extensive text (through the hy-OCR model1), collages, prominent borders and AI-generated content (AIGC). To maintain accuracy when dealing with massive data, these detectors were trained using balanced training datasets created through stratified sampling. The proliferation of AIGC images poses significant challenge by distorting natural data distributions and impairing model convergence. Our mitigation strategy combined an automated AIGC detection model [24, 25, 26] with the removal of all images from data sources found to have high proportion of AI-generated content. Our subject"

Code: Transformer Engine support for NVFP4 training. 1. Introduction The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs) has increased the demand for more efficient numerical formats to lower computational cost, memory demand, and energy consumption during training. 8-bit floating point (FP8 and MXFP8) has emerged as popular data type for accelerated training of LLMs (Micikevicius et al., 2022; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024; Mishra et al., 2025). Recent advances in narrow-precision hardware (NVIDIA Blackwell, 2024) have positioned 4-bit floating point (FP4) as the next logical step (Tseng et al., 2025b; Chmiel et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025; Castro et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025; Rouhani et al., 2023), delivering twoto three-fold boost in arithmetic performance and reducing memory usage by half compared to FP8. This technical report presents an in-depth analysis of large language model (LLM) pretraining using NVFP4 (Alvarez et al., 2025), 4-bit data format that extends the microscaling approach (Rouhani et al., 2023). Unlike 4-bit microscaling formats such as MXFP4 (Rouhani et al., 2023; Open-Compute-Project, 2023), NVFP4 employs smaller micro-block structure, which more effectively captures the local dynamic range in the data. NVFP4 also utilizes an FP8 scale factor format that incorporates fractional precision for more accurate microscaling. In addition, NVFP4 employs two-level scaling strategy, which combines fine-grained FP8 scale factor with an FP32 scale applied at the tensor level. These design choices allow for more precise and accurate representation of tensor values during training. Leveraging the NVFP4 format, we introduce 4-bit training methodology that achieves accuracies comparable to FP8 on very strong language models. This approach preserves numerically sensitive layers in higher precision, utilizes two-dimensional (2D) block scaling to maintain same quantized representations across forward and backward passes, applies Random Hadamard transforms (Tseng et al., 2025b; Castro et al., 2025) to disperse large-magnitude outliers, and employs stochastic rounding (Tseng et al., 2025b; Chmiel et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025; Castro et al., 2025) on gradients to reduce quantization bias. Ablation studies confirm that each component of this methodology is important for 4-bit training, especially 2025 NVIDIA. All rights reserved. Pretraining Large Language Models with NVFP4 in large-scale models and during long token horizons. To validate our approach, we train very strong 12-billion parameter LLM (NVIDIA, 2025b) on 10 trillion tokens, demonstrating that its loss curve and accuracies on downstream tasks closely match with those of an FP8 baseline. While our work establishes the feasibility of FP4 training at large scales, this report is primarily concerned with the underlying algorithms and methodology rather than with runtime efficiency or system-level optimizations. This marks, to our knowledge, the first successful demonstration of training billion-parameter language models with 4-bit precision over multi-trillion-token horizon, laying the foundation for faster and more efficient training of future frontier models. The remainder of this technical report is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the NVFP4 format, Section 3 presents results for 12 billion model trained on 10 trillion tokens with NVFP4, Section 4 discusses the training methodology for NVFP4, and Section 5 compares training with NVFP4 and MXFP4. The appendices include details of the training setup (models, datasets, and hyperparameters), the quantization procedure, and ablation studies analyzing the impact of different technique choices. 2. NVFP4 Format Due to the limited range of narrow floating-point formats, microscaling (MX) formats (Open-ComputeProject, 2023) were introduced to balance dynamic range and precision. These formats are characterized by block-wise representation where group of data elements shares single, common scale factor. MX formats include 8-bit (MXFP8), 6-bit (MXFP6), and 4-bit (MXFP4) floating-point types. In MXFP4, each element is represented as E2M11 (Open-Compute-Project, 2023), meaning it has 1 sign bit, 2 exponent bits, and 1 mantissa bit. This allows MXFP4 to encode the values 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Since original higher-precision values (e.g., FP32 or BF16) often exceed the FP4 range, they mus"

Text:"Cogito, Ergo Ludo: An Agent that Learns to Play by Reasoning and Planning Sai Wang1,2, Yu Wu2 and Zhongwen Xu1 1Tencent, 2Wuhan University 5 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 1 2 5 0 5 2 . 9 0 5 2 : r Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge opaquely within neural network weights. We propose different paradigm, one in which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito, ergo ludo (CEL), novel agent architecture that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its environments mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from tabula rasa state with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on cycle of interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where it refines its explicit model of the environments dynamics, and Strategy and Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e., Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work demonstrates path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only act effectively but also build transparent and improving model of their world through explicit reasoning on raw experience. 1. Introduction The quest to create intelligent agents [25] capable of mastering complex, interactive environments has been long-standing goal of artificial intelligence [26].

Text:"IWR-BENCH: CAN LVLMS RECONSTRUCT INTERACTIVE WEBPAGE FROM USER INTERACTION VIDEO? IWR-Bench TeamThe webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113 meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles, and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets (e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with comprehensive metric system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal significant challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity (64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic, establishing IWR-Bench as challenging frontier for vision-language research. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is available at https://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.Recent advances in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have unlocked remarkable capabilities in visual understanding and code generation (OpenAI, 2025; Comanici et al., 2025; Bai et al., 2025). 5 2 0 2 9 2 ] . [ 1 9 0 7 4 2 . 9 0 5 2 : r Figure 1: Performance of 10 representative models on IWR-Bench. For comprehensive list of all 28 model results, see Table 3. 1 Figure 2: Overview of the IWR-Bench task and evaluation. The inputs to the model are (a) user interaction video and (b) composite images of all static assets sniffed from the webpage. The evaluation employs an agent-as-judge framework (Zhuge et al., 2024), where an automated agent assesses the rendered pages interactivity by executing (c) ground-truth action sequence and its visual fidelity through screenshot comparison. State-of-the-art models can now translate static screenshot of webpage into corresponding HTML with impressive fidelity (Yun et al., 2024; Gui et al., 2025). This nascent success, however, highlights fundamental limitation of current evaluation methodologies. Existing benchmarks are either confined to static reconstruction (e.g., Design2Code (Si et al., 2024), WebSight (Laurencon et al., 2024)) or model interactions as single-step, stateless events from image pairs (e.g., Interaction2Code (Xiao et al., 2025)), while also failing to provide the necessary static assets for reconstruction. This simplified setup falls short of capturing the continuous, stateful workflows and complete resource context characteristic of real-world web applications. The disconnect between demonstrated capabilities and the demands of true interactivity motivates our central research question: Can LVLMs reconstruct the dynamic, interactive functionalities of webpage from observing user interaction video? Reconstructing an interactive webpage from video poses two fundamental challenges. The first, comprehensive multi-modal perception and reasoning (Luo et al., 2024; Gupta & Kembhavi, 2023; Song et al., 2025; Deka et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2023), is the process of inferring latent interaction logic from dynamic visual evidence. This requires model to ground its temporal understanding of observed interactions in precise visual comprehension of the resultant UI states. critical facet of this reasoning is robust image matching to associate dynamic elements with their static asset counterparts. The second challenge, advanced code generation (Jimenez et al., 2024; Xiao et al., 2025; Li et al., 2022), is the translation of this inferred logic into functional code that implements the complex, stateful logic of interactive applications (e.g., web-games like 2048 and Minesweeper). The construction of comprehensive benchmark for interactive webpage reconstruction confronts three pivotal challenges. The first pertains to ensuring Diverse Interaction Coverage, which necessitates the curation of tasks spanning broad spectrum of interaction paradigms and visual complexities, while simultaneously adhering to strict standardization for reproducible evaluation. The second challenge centers on the establishment of an Authentic Task Environment. Departing from prior benchmarks characterized by incomplete setups or placeholder assets (Jiang et al., 2025; Gui et al., 2025), this requires the meticulous curation of complete set of authentic resources from live websites. Such resources must encompass both static assets, such as images and icons, and dynamic content, such as embedded videos, to faithfully represent real-world development contexts. The final challenge lies in the formulation of Robust Automated Evaluation protocol. Conventional metrics, including pixel-wise similarity, are insufficient for this purpose (Zhang et al., 2018; Caron et al., 2 Figure 3: An overview of the IWR-Bench taxonomy, which organizes tasks along three orthogonal axes: Domain, Visual Complexity, and Interaction Logic. 2021; Radford et al., 2021), as they cannot appraise functionality. An effective protocol must therefore employ programmatic interaction with the generated webpage to ascertain both the functional integrity of its components and the state-wise visual consistency across dynamic transitions. This paper formalizes the task of Interactive Webpage Reconstruction (IWR) and introduces IWRBench, comprehensive benchmark that addresses these fundamental design challenges. To ensure comprehensive coverage, tasks are taxonomized along orthogonal axes of application domain, visual complexity, and interaction logic, as illustrated in Figure 3. Each task instance, as depicted in Figure 2, then provides the model with (a) an inte"

OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset with hierarchical task taxonomy and automated generation, significantly improves performance in image generation and editing tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks, with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench) and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL) enhances LLMs by teaching them to generate critiques, leading to improved performance on code generation and logic reasoning tasks compared to standard RL.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a popular training paradigm, particularly when paired with reasoning models. While effective, it primarily focuses on generating responses and lacks mechanisms to explicitly foster critique or reflection. Several recent studies, like Critique-Fine-Tuning (CFT) and Critique-Guided-Distillation (CGD) have shown the benefits of explicitly teaching LLMs how to critique. Motivated by them, we propose Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL), where the model is tasked with generating a critique for a given (question, solution) pair. The reward is determined solely by whether the final judgment label c in {True, False} of the generated critique aligns with the ground-truth judgment c^*. Building on this point, we introduce Critique-Coder, which is trained on a hybrid of RL and CRL by substituting 20\% of the standard RL data with CRL data. We fine-tune multiple models (Critique-Coder) and evaluate them on different benchmarks to show their advantages over RL-only models. We show that Critique-Coder consistently outperforms RL-only baselines on all the evaluated benchmarks. Notably, our Critique-Coder-8B can reach over 60\% on LiveCodeBench (v5), outperforming other reasoning models like DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Beyond code generation, Critique-Coder also demonstrates enhanced general reasoning abilities, as evidenced by its better performance on logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset. This indicates that the application of CRL on coding datasets enhances general reasoning and critique abilities, which are transferable across a broad range of tasks. Hence, we believe that CRL works as a great complement to standard RL for LLM reasoning.

VideoScore2 is a multi-dimensional, interpretable framework for evaluating text-to-video generation, assessing visual quality, alignment, and consistency with detailed rationales.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality, semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive nature of video quality assessment.

Rolling Forcing is a novel video generation technique that reduces error accumulation in long video streams by using joint denoising, attention sink mechanism, and efficient training with non-overlapping windows.  					AI-generated summary 				 Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second, we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU, with substantially reduced error accumulation.

A dense-sparse switchable attention framework, InfLLM-V2, enhances long-sequence processing in large language models by efficiently adapting between dense and sparse attention mechanisms.  					AI-generated summary 				 Long-sequence processing is a critical capability for modern large language models. However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer architecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing long sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters and disrupt the conventional pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2 reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2 that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that InfLLM-V2 is 4times faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and 99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we have trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1 (https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model, providing a reproducible implementation for the research community.

While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters and disrupt the conventional pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2 reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2 that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that InfLLM-V2 is 4times faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and 99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we have trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1 (https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model, providing a reproducible implementation for the research community."

PixelCraft, a multi-agent system, enhances visual reasoning in multimodal large language models by integrating high-fidelity image processing and flexible reasoning through a dynamic workflow and image memory.  					AI-generated summary 				 Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning; however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism. Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be available at https://github.com/microsoft/PixelCraft.

GSM8K-V is a new visual multi-image mathematical reasoning benchmark that highlights the limitations of current vision language models in handling visual mathematical problems.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text, enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception, planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently, numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation, we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement. GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and generalizable VLMs.

HunyuanImage 3.0, a multimodal model with an autoregressive framework, achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation and text-image alignment using a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with over 80 billion parameters.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present HunyuanImage 3.0, a native multimodal model that unifies multimodal understanding and generation within an autoregressive framework, with its image generation module publicly available. The achievement of HunyuanImage 3.0 relies on several key components, including meticulous data curation, advanced architecture design, a native Chain-of-Thoughts schema, progressive model pre-training, aggressive model post-training, and an efficient infrastructure that enables large-scale training and inference. With these advancements, we successfully trained a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model comprising over 80 billion parameters in total, with 13 billion parameters activated per token during inference, making it the largest and most powerful open-source image generative model to date. We conducted extensive experiments and the results of automatic and human evaluation of text-image alignment and visual quality demonstrate that HunyuanImage 3.0 rivals previous state-of-the-art models. By releasing the code and weights of HunyuanImage 3.0, we aim to enable the community to explore new ideas with a state-of-the-art foundation model, fostering a dynamic and vibrant multimodal ecosystem.

Dynamic Experts Search (DES) enhances large language models by controlling expert activation during inference, improving accuracy and stability without additional cost.  					AI-generated summary 				 Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However, existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search (DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

MathBode provides a diagnostic for mathematical reasoning in LLMs by analyzing frequency-resolved metrics of model outputs compared to exact solutions, revealing systematic low-pass behavior and phase lag.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument (G approx 1, phi approx 0). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency. We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

The Reasoning Manifold framework quantifies and localizes reasoning failures in Large Language Models by analyzing geometric deviations in internal representations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations, thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of black-box models.

A novel training approach using NVFP4 format with Random Hadamard transforms, two-dimensional quantization, stochastic rounding, and selective high-precision layers enables stable and accurate training of large language models in 4-bit precision.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models (LLMs) today are powerful problem solvers across many domains, and they continue to get stronger as they scale in model size, training set size, and training set quality, as shown by extensive research and experimentation across the industry. Training a frontier model today requires on the order of tens to hundreds of yottaflops, which is a massive investment of time, compute, and energy. Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore essential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit floating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even narrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional improvements in computational speed and resource utilization. However, quantization at this level poses challenges to training stability, convergence, and implementation, notably for large-scale models trained on long token horizons.   In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stable and accurate training of large language models (LLMs) using the NVFP4 format. Our method integrates Random Hadamard transforms (RHT) to bound block-level outliers, employs a two-dimensional quantization scheme for consistent representations across both the forward and backward passes, utilizes stochastic rounding for unbiased gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers. We validate our approach by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion tokens -- the longest publicly documented training run in 4-bit precision to date. Our results show that the model trained with our NVFP4-based pretraining technique achieves training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to an FP8 baseline. These findings highlight that NVFP4, when combined with our training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM training algorithms.

CEL, a novel agent architecture using a Large Language Model, learns to master complex environments through explicit reasoning and planning, achieving success in diverse grid-world tasks with sparse rewards.  					AI-generated summary 				 The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito, ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e., Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

"CEL, a novel agent architecture using a Large Language Model, learns to master complex environments through explicit reasoning and planning, achieving success in diverse grid-world tasks with sparse rewards.  					AI-generated summary 				 The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito, ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e., Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world through explicit reasoning on raw experience."

IWR-Bench evaluates Large Vision-Language Models in reconstructing interactive webpages from video, highlighting challenges in multi-modal reasoning and code generation.  					AI-generated summary 				 The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113 meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles, and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets (e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity (64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models' ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic, establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is available at https://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.

DART, a decoupled reinforcement learning framework for GUI agents, improves efficiency and learning effectiveness through asynchronous modules and adaptive data curation, achieving high task success rates on the OSWorld benchmark.  					AI-generated summary 				 Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner. DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput, and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1) pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

RHYTHM uses hierarchical temporal tokenization and large language models to predict human mobility, capturing long-range dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors efficiently.  					AI-generated summary 				 Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies, thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a 5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/he-h/rhythm.
