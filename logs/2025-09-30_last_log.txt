In this work, we present BOE-XSUM, curated dataset comprising 3,648 concise, plain-language summaries of documents sourced from Spains Bolet覺n Oficial del Estado (BOE), the State Official Gazette. Each entry in the dataset includes short summary, the original text, and its document type label. We evaluate the performance of medium-sized large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on BOEXSUM, comparing them to general-purpose generative models in zero-shot setting. Results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform their non-specialized counterparts. Notably, the best-performing modelBERTIN GPT-J 6B (32-bit precision)achieves 24% performance gain over the top zero-shot model, DeepSeekR1 (accuracies of 41.6% vs. 33.5%). Keywords: Extreme-summarization, legal texts, generative models, evaluation resources.

A new benchmark, Personalized Deep Research Bench, evaluates the personalization capabilities of Deep Research Agents across diverse tasks and user profiles using the PQR Evaluation Framework.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep Research Agents (DRAs) can autonomously conduct complex investigations and generate comprehensive reports, demonstrating strong real-world potential. However, existing evaluations mostly rely on close-ended benchmarks, while open-ended deep research benchmarks remain scarce and typically neglect personalized scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Personalized Deep Research Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating personalization in DRAs. It pairs 50 diverse research tasks across 10 domains with 25 authentic user profiles that combine structured persona attributes with dynamic real-world contexts, yielding 250 realistic user-task queries. To assess system performance, we propose the PQR Evaluation Framework, which jointly measures (P) Personalization Alignment, (Q) Content Quality, and (R) Factual Reliability. Our experiments on a range of systems highlight current capabilities and limitations in handling personalized deep research. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for developing and evaluating the next generation of truly personalized AI research assistants.

"A new benchmark, Personalized Deep Research Bench, evaluates the personalization capabilities of Deep Research Agents across diverse tasks and user profiles using the PQR Evaluation Framework.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep Research Agents (DRAs) can autonomously conduct complex investigations and generate comprehensive reports, demonstrating strong real-world potential. However, existing evaluations mostly rely on close-ended benchmarks, while open-ended deep research benchmarks remain scarce and typically neglect personalized scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Personalized Deep Research Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating personalization in DRAs. It pairs 50 diverse research tasks across 10 domains with 25 authentic user profiles that combine structured persona attributes with dynamic real-world contexts, yielding 250 realistic user-task queries. To assess system performance, we propose the PQR Evaluation Framework, which jointly measures (P) Personalization Alignment, (Q) Content Quality, and (R) Factual Reliability. Our experiments on a range of systems highlight current capabilities and limitations in handling personalized deep research. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for developing and evaluating the next generation of truly personalized AI research assistants."

DataMind addresses challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents through task taxonomy, trajectory sampling, dynamic training objectives, and stable multi-turn rollouts, achieving state-of-the-art performance on data analysis benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however, rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B for the community's future research.

A framework combining SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier addresses challenges in verifying LLM-generated scientific answers through cross-disciplinary benchmarks and reasoning-augmented verification.  					AI-generated summary 				 As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations: (a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b) heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training, SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together, SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

"A framework combining SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier addresses challenges in verifying LLM-generated scientific answers through cross-disciplinary benchmarks and reasoning-augmented verification.  					AI-generated summary 				 As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations: (a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b) heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training, SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together, SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains."

Proposed decoding strategies and reinforcement learning algorithms improve the performance and efficiency of masked diffusion language models during inference.  					AI-generated summary 				 Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored. A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal (parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding, achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO) for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks, such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/yjyddq/EOSER-ASS-RL.

BOE-XSUM, a dataset of Spanish legal document summaries, demonstrates that fine-tuned medium-sized LLMs outperform general-purpose models in zero-shot summarization tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 The ability to summarize long documents succinctly is increasingly important in daily life due to information overload, yet there is a notable lack of such summaries for Spanish documents in general, and in the legal domain in particular. In this work, we present BOE-XSUM, a curated dataset comprising 3,648 concise, plain-language summaries of documents sourced from Spain's ``Bolet\'{\i}n Oficial del Estado'' (BOE), the State Official Gazette. Each entry in the dataset includes a short summary, the original text, and its document type label. We evaluate the performance of medium-sized large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on BOE-XSUM, comparing them to general-purpose generative models in a zero-shot setting. Results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform their non-specialized counterparts. Notably, the best-performing model -- BERTIN GPT-J 6B (32-bit precision) -- achieves a 24\% performance gain over the top zero-shot model, DeepSeek-R1 (accuracies of 41.6\% vs.\ 33.5\%).

PARROT is a benchmark for evaluating Cross-System SQL Translation across multiple database systems, addressing limitations in existing SQL benchmarks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models (LLMS) have shown increasing effectiveness in Text-to-SQL tasks. However, another closely related problem, Cross-System SQL Translation (a.k.a., SQL-to-SQL), which adapts a query written for one database system (e.g., MySQL) into its equivalent one for another system (e.g., ClickHouse), is of great practical importance but remains underexplored. Existing SQL benchmarks are not well-suited for SQL-to-SQL evaluation, which (1) focus on a limited set of database systems (often just SQLite) and (2) cannot capture many system-specific SQL dialects (e.g., customized functions, data types, and syntax rules). Thus, in this paper, we introduce PARROT, a Practical And Realistic BenchmaRk for CrOss-System SQL Translation. PARROT comprises 598 translation pairs from 38 open-source benchmarks and real-world business services, specifically prepared to challenge system-specific SQL understanding (e.g., LLMS achieve lower than 38.53% accuracy on average). We also provide multiple benchmark variants, including PARROT-Diverse with 28,003 translations (for extensive syntax testing) and PARROT-Simple with 5,306 representative samples (for focused stress testing), covering 22 production-grade database systems. To promote future research, we release a public leaderboard and source code at: https://code4db.github.io/parrot-bench/.
