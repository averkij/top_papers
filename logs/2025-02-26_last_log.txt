Recent studies have explored combining different LoRAs to jointly generate learned style and content. However, existing methods either fail to effectively preserve both the original subject and style simultaneously or require additional training. In this paper, we argue that the intrinsic properties of LoRA can effectively guide diffusion models in merging learned subject and style. Building on this insight, we propose K-LoRA, a simple yet effective training-free LoRA fusion approach. In each attention layer, K-LoRA compares the Top-K elements in each LoRA to be fused, determining which LoRA to select for optimal fusion. This selection mechanism ensures that the most representative features of both subject and style are retained during the fusion process, effectively balancing their contributions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively integrates the subject and style information learned by the original LoRAs, outperforming state-of-the-art training-based approaches in both qualitative and quantitative results.

Motivated by reducing the computational and storage costs of LLMs, model compression and KV cache compression have attracted much attention from researchers. However, current methods predominantly emphasize maintaining the performance of compressed LLMs, as measured by perplexity or simple accuracy on tasks of common sense knowledge QA and basic arithmetic reasoning. In this blog, we present a brief review of recent advancements in LLMs related to retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, external tools, and computational expressivity, all of which substantially enhance LLM performance. Then, we propose a lottery LLM hypothesis suggesting that for a given LLM and task, there exists a smaller lottery LLM capable of producing the same performance as the original LLM with the assistance of multi-step reasoning and external tools. Based on the review of current progress in LLMs, we discuss and summarize the essential capabilities that the lottery LLM and KV cache compression must possess, which are currently overlooked in existing methods.

We introduce Shakti VLM, a family of vision-language models in the capacity of 1B and 4B parameters designed to address data efficiency challenges in multimodal learning. While recent VLMs achieve strong performance through extensive training data, Shakti models leverage architectural innovations to attain competitive results with fewer tokens. Key advancements include QK-Normalization for attention stability, hybrid normalization techniques, and enhanced positional encoding. A three-stage training strategy further optimizes learning efficiency. Evaluations show that Shakti-Shakti-VLM-1B and Shakti-VLM-4B excel in document understanding, Visual Reasoning, OCR extraction, and general multimodal reasoning. Our results highlight that high performance can be achieved through model design and training strategy rather than sheer data volume, making Shakti an efficient solution for enterprise-scale multimodal tasks.
