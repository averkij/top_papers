Text:"SpargeAttn: Accurate Sparse Attention Accelerating Any Model Inference Jintao Zhang * 1 Chendong Xiang * 1 Haofeng Huang * 1 Jia Wei 1 Haocheng Xi 2 Jun Zhu 1 Jianfei Chen 1 5 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 1 7 3 1 8 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r aAn efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmaxaware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-toend metrics. The codes are available at https: //github.com/thu-ml/SpargeAttn. 1 1. Introduction As sequence lengths in large models become longer, such as 45K-128K in video generation and language models (Yang et al., 2025; Bao et al., 2024; Dubey et al., 2024), the *Equal contribution 1Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University 2University of CaliforJianfei Chen <jiannia, Berkeley. feic@tsinghua.edu.cn>. Correspondence to: Preprint. 1All experiments in this paper used SpargeAttn based on SageAttention. An updated implementation based on SageAttention2, is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/ SpargeAttn. It further offers 30% speedup over the Attention in this paper. 1 Figure 1. SpargeAttn can achieve 1.83x speedup on Mochi on L40 GPU, with no video quality loss. time consuming of attention occupies significant portion of inference latency in large models (Zhang et al., 2025). Fortunately, the attention map = Softmax(QK /d) exhibits inherent sparsity, as the softmax operation often creates many values approaching zero (Deng et al., 2024). Sparse attention methods exploit such sparsity to accelerate attention by (1) constructing sparse mask, which indicates the important non-zero entries of the attention map that should be computed, and (2) computing attention only for the parts corresponding to the sparse mask. There are three distinct categories of sparse attention methods based on how the sparse mask is generated. pattern-based method (Zhang et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2024a; Fu et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024; Xiao et al., 2025; 2024b) relies on specific sparsity patterns based on empirical observations, dynamic sparse attention (Ribar et al., 2024; Singhania et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024; FlexPrefill, 2025; Gao et al., 2024) computes the mask on-the-fly based on the inputs, and training-based method (Kitaev et al., 2020; Pagliardini et al., 2023) directly train models with native sparse attention. Limitation. (L1. Universality) Though existing sparse attention methods already demonstrate promising speedup on some tasks, their universality is still limited. Existing works are typically developed for specific tasks, such as language modeling, utilizing task-specific patterns such as sliding windows or attention sinks. However, the attention pattern varies significantly across tasks (see examples in Fig. 2), making these patterns hard to generalize. (L2. Usability) Moreover, it is difficult to implement both accurate and efficient sparse attention for any input. This is because accuracy demands precise prediction of the sparse regions in the attention map, while efficiency requires the overhead of this prediction to be minimal. However, current methods are difficult to effectively satisfy both of the requirements siSpargeAttn: Accurate Sparse Attention Accelerating Any Model Inference 2. Related Work Depending on how the sparsity mask is constructed, sparse attention methods can be divided into three types: (1) Pattern required methods rely on some fixed patterns of the attention map, such as sliding windows or attention sinks (Xiao et al., 2024b). H2O (Zhang et al., 2023), InfLLM (Xiao et al., 2024a), and DUOAttention (Xiao et al., 2025) rely on sliding window pattern. SampleAttention (Zhu et al., 2024), MOA (Fu et al., 2024), and StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2024b) rely on sliding window and attention sink pattern. DitFastAttn (Yuan et al., 2024) relies on sliding window patterns and similarities between different attention maps. Moreover, DitFastAttn is restricted to simple diffusion transformers, showing incompatibility with language models and MMDiT models like Flux (Black Forest Labs, 2023), Stable Diffusion3 and 3.5 (Stability AI, 2023), and CogVideoX (Yang et al., 2025). As the pattern varies across models, these methods may not universally work for different models. (2) Dynamic sparse methods dynamically construct the sparse mask based on the input without the need of preset patterns, and are thus potentially more universal. Existing works can be further categorized into channel compression and token compression. Channel compression methods include SparQAttn (Ribar et al., 2024) and LokiAttn (Singhania et al., 2024). They construct the mask by carrying full attention with reduced dimensionality. However, as the dimension is already small, e.g., 64, 128, in commonly used attention, the speedup potential might be limited. Token compression methods include MInference (Jiang et al., 2024) and FlexPrefill (FlexPrefill, 2025). They construct the mask by compressing each block of tokens to single token and compute attention on this shorter sequence. However, this approximation is too aggressive: missing important blocks of is possible if they do not have large attention score on the compressed sequence. SeerAttention (Gao et al., 2024) requires training of additional parameters for attention, which is expensive to use. Moreover, they are all designed for language models, and their applicability to other model types, such as diffusion models, remains uncertain. (3) Training-based methods modify "

Text:"SWE-RL: Advancing LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning on Open Software Evolution Yuxiang Wei1,2, Olivier Duchenne1, Jade Copet1, Quentin Carbonneaux1 Lingming Zhang2, Daniel Fried3,4, Gabriel Synnaeve1, Rishabh Singh3, Sida I. Wang1 1FAIR at Meta, 2University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign 3GenAI at Meta, 4Carnegie Mellon University The recent DeepSeek-R1 release has demonstrated the immense potential of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While DeepSeek-R1 and other follow-up work primarily focus on applying RL to competitive coding and math problems, this paper introduces SWE-RL, the first approach to scale RL-based LLM reasoning for real-world software engineering. Leveraging lightweight rule-based reward (e.g., the similarity score between ground-truth and LLM-generated solutions), SWE-RL enables LLMs to autonomously recover developers reasoning processes and solutions by learning from extensive open-source software evolution datathe record of softwares entire lifecycle, including its code snapshots, code changes, and events such as issues and pull requests. Trained on top of Llama 3, our resulting reasoning model, Llama3-SWE-RL-70B, achieves 41.0% solve rate on SWE-bench Verifieda human-verified collection of real-world GitHub issues. To our knowledge, this is the best performance reported for medium-sized (<100B) LLMs to date, even comparable to leading proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o. Surprisingly, despite performing RL solely on software evolution data, Llama3-SWE-RL has even emerged with generalized reasoning skills. For example, it shows improved results on five out-of-domain tasks, namely, function coding, library use, code reasoning, mathematics, and general language understanding, whereas supervised-finetuning baseline even leads to performance degradation on average. Overall, SWE-RL opens up new direction to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through reinforcement learning"

Background consistency remains a significant challenge in image editing tasks. Despite extensive developments, existing works still face a trade-off between maintaining similarity to the original image and generating content that aligns with the target. Here, we propose KV-Edit, a training-free approach that uses KV cache in DiTs to maintain background consistency, where background tokens are preserved rather than regenerated, eliminating the need for complex mechanisms or expensive training, ultimately generating new content that seamlessly integrates with the background within user-provided regions. We further explore the memory consumption of the KV cache during editing and optimize the space complexity to O(1) using an inversion-free method. Our approach is compatible with any DiT-based generative model without additional training. Experiments demonstrate that KV-Edit significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both background and image quality, even surpassing training-based methods.

An efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics. The codes are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SpargeAttn.

Recent advancements in open-source multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have primarily focused on enhancing foundational capabilities, leaving a significant gap in human preference alignment. This paper introduces OmniAlign-V, a comprehensive dataset of 200K high-quality training samples featuring diverse images, complex questions, and varied response formats to improve MLLMs' alignment with human preferences. We also present MM-AlignBench, a human-annotated benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MLLMs' alignment with human values. Experimental results show that finetuning MLLMs with OmniAlign-V, using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), significantly enhances human preference alignment while maintaining or enhancing performance on standard VQA benchmarks, preserving their fundamental capabilities.

Multi-layer image generation is a fundamental task that enables users to isolate, select, and edit specific image layers, thereby revolutionizing interactions with generative models. In this paper, we introduce the Anonymous Region Transformer (ART), which facilitates the direct generation of variable multi-layer transparent images based on a global text prompt and an anonymous region layout. Inspired by Schema theory suggests that knowledge is organized in frameworks (schemas) that enable people to interpret and learn from new information by linking it to prior knowledge.}, this anonymous region layout allows the generative model to autonomously determine which set of visual tokens should align with which text tokens, which is in contrast to the previously dominant semantic layout for the image generation task. In addition, the layer-wise region crop mechanism, which only selects the visual tokens belonging to each anonymous region, significantly reduces attention computation costs and enables the efficient generation of images with numerous distinct layers (e.g., 50+). When compared to the full attention approach, our method is over 12 times faster and exhibits fewer layer conflicts. Furthermore, we propose a high-quality multi-layer transparent image autoencoder that supports the direct encoding and decoding of the transparency of variable multi-layer images in a joint manner. By enabling precise control and scalable layer generation, ART establishes a new paradigm for interactive content creation.

The recent DeepSeek-R1 release has demonstrated the immense potential of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While DeepSeek-R1 and other follow-up work primarily focus on applying RL to competitive coding and math problems, this paper introduces SWE-RL, the first approach to scale RL-based LLM reasoning for real-world software engineering. Leveraging a lightweight rule-based reward (e.g., the similarity score between ground-truth and LLM-generated solutions), SWE-RL enables LLMs to autonomously recover a developer's reasoning processes and solutions by learning from extensive open-source software evolution data -- the record of a software's entire lifecycle, including its code snapshots, code changes, and events such as issues and pull requests. Trained on top of Llama 3, our resulting reasoning model, Llama3-SWE-RL-70B, achieves a 41.0% solve rate on SWE-bench Verified -- a human-verified collection of real-world GitHub issues. To our knowledge, this is the best performance reported for medium-sized (<100B) LLMs to date, even comparable to leading proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o. Surprisingly, despite performing RL solely on software evolution data, Llama3-SWE-RL has even emerged with generalized reasoning skills. For example, it shows improved results on five out-of-domain tasks, namely, function coding, library use, code reasoning, mathematics, and general language understanding, whereas a supervised-finetuning baseline even leads to performance degradation on average. Overall, SWE-RL opens up a new direction to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through reinforcement learning on massive software engineering data.
