[ 1 2 7 8 5 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r MUTAGREP: Execution-Free Repository-Grounded Plan Search for Code-Use Zaid Khan 1 Ali Farhadi 2 Ranjay Krishna 2 Luca Weihs 3 Mohit Bansal 1 Tanmay GuptaWhen human requests an LLM to complete coding task using functionality from large code repository, how do we provide context from the repo to the LLM? One approach is to add the entire repo to the LLMs context window. However, most tasks involve only fraction of symbols from repo, longer contexts are detrimental to the LLMs reasoning abilities (Kuratov et al., 2024), and context windows are not unlimited. Alternatively, we could emulate the human ability to navigate large repo, pick out the right functionality, and form plan to solve the task. We propose MUTAGREP (Mutation-guided Grounded Repository Plan Search), an approach to search for plans that decompose user request into natural language steps grounded in the codebase. MUTAGREP performs neural tree search in plan space, exploring by mutating plans and using symbol retriever for grounding. On the challenging LongCodeArena benchmark, our plans use less than 5% of the 128K context window for GPT-4o but rival the coding performance of GPT-4o with context window filled with the repo. Plans produced by MUTAGREP allow Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B and 72B to match the performance of GPT4o with full repo context and enable progress on the hardest LongCodeArena tasks. Project page: zaidkhan.me/MutaGReP Figure 1. MUTAGREP Overview Given user request that requires writing code against specific codebase, we search for realizable plans to solve the users request using LLM-guided tree search. Our search procedure uses symbol retriever to constrain search to plans which are implementable with symbols available in the codebase and explores the search space by mutating plans. Each step of the plan consists of natural language intent and symbols from the codebase that can be used to implement the intent. The user request along with the detailed plan serves as an enriched query that provides necessary context from the codebase to any downstream coding system to convert the plan to code. Our plan search benefits from test-time compute scaling and produces repo-grounded plans without requiring code execution. 1. Introduction Code generation systems powered by LLMs are routinely tasked with writing new code given an existing large codebase. One approach to conditioning an LLMs generation on repository is to utilize its working memory by concatenating all files in the codebase into massive prompt. This is an inefficient use of finite context, because many programming tasks require only small fraction of all symbols (functions, classes, global variables etc) in the codebase. Recent in1University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 2Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (Ai2) 3Vercept AI (work done while at Ai2). Correspondence to: Zaid Khan <zaidkhan@cs.unc.edu>, Tanmay Gupta <tanmayg@allenai.org>. vestigation also shows that leading LLMs are effective at utilizing less than 20% of their context lengths with sharp decline in performance with increasing reasoning complexity (Kuratov et al., 2024). Can we do better? Human programmers are able to understand complex codebases with much smaller biological working memory. They achieve this by decomposing the target task into smaller steps and then using code search tools to identify relevant symbols (functions, classes etc) to use in each step. This is often an iterative process where the programmer interacts with the codebase to develop realizable plan based on the symbols available in the codebase. The realizable plan can then be implemented. 1 MUTAGREP: Execution-Free Repository-Grounded Plan Search for Code-Use In this work, we aim to replicate the ability of human programmers to iteratively search for repo-grounded realizable plan to solve user query given codebase. This plan should wrap all relevant information from the codebase into self-contained prompt which is human readable, editable and can be handed off to any code generation LLM or coding assistant for translation into code. Specifically, given codebase and user query that requires writing code using symbols in the codebase, we aim to find repo-grounded plan with multiple steps. Each step consists of natural language intent and the symbols from the codebase that may be used to implement or realize the plan. good plan is complete, concise, and faithful to the original query. These plans along with the original user query can be viewed as an enriched query that provides all relevant context from the codebase with detailed steps on how to solve the user query. Since the space of all plans is semi-structured and massive, MUTAGREP formulates repo-grounded plan search as an LLM-guided tree-search problem. Each node in the tree represents plan. Each step of the search process involves identifying the most promising node to expand and create children or successors of the node by mutating the plan. The mutation aims to make the successors more accurate, repo-grounded and realizable. When the search budget is exhausted the best plan is returned to the user. Importantly, MUTAGREP does not require executing any code. The design space of MUTAGREP consists of four key components - successor function to mutate plans, symbol retriever to ground intents to symbols in the codebase, treetraversal algorithm that decides the order in which to expand the nodes, and plan ranker to select the most promising node to expand or to identify the best plan from the available nodes. We use the challenging LongCodeArena benchmark (Bogomolov et al., 2024) to thoroughly explore the design space of repo-grounded plan-search. Our contributions include: (i) demonstrating the utility of repo-grounded plans for code-use ( Table 2, Figure 7, Figure 8); (ii) formulating execution-free repo-grounded planning as LLM-guided tree search using an intent to symbol grounding function (Sec. 3); (iii) elucidating and studying the design space of repo-grounded plan search ( Figure 5, Figure 6, Table 3); and (iv) demonstrating that plan search allows code-use to benefit from gains by scaling test-time compute ( Figure 5 and Figure 6). 2. Related Work Repository-grounded code generation. Existing work on repo-level code generation has explored two distinct directions. One line of work focuses on building software engineering agents that can edit real-world codebases to solve Figure 2. repo-grounded plan cr"

When a human requests an LLM to complete a coding task using functionality from a large code repository, how do we provide context from the repo to the LLM? One approach is to add the entire repo to the LLM's context window. However, most tasks involve only fraction of symbols from a repo, longer contexts are detrimental to the LLM's reasoning abilities, and context windows are not unlimited. Alternatively, we could emulate the human ability to navigate a large repo, pick out the right functionality, and form a plan to solve the task. We propose MutaGReP (Mutation-guided Grounded Repository Plan Search), an approach to search for plans that decompose a user request into natural language steps grounded in the codebase. MutaGReP performs neural tree search in plan space, exploring by mutating plans and using a symbol retriever for grounding. On the challenging LongCodeArena benchmark, our plans use less than 5% of the 128K context window for GPT-4o but rival the coding performance of GPT-4o with a context window filled with the repo. Plans produced by MutaGReP allow Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B and 72B to match the performance of GPT-4o with full repo context and enable progress on the hardest LongCodeArena tasks.

  "desc": "Статья представляет новый подход MutaGReP для эффективного использования больших репозиториев кода в задачах машинного обучения. Метод осуществляет поиск планов, которые разбивают запрос пользователя на шаги на естественном языке, связанные с кодовой базой. MutaGReP использует нейронный поиск по дереву в пространстве планов, исследуя мутации планов и применяя символьный поиск для привязки к коду. Результаты показывают, что планы MutaGReP позволяют моделям использовать менее 5% контекстного окна, но достигать производительности, сравнимой с полным контекстом репозитория.",
