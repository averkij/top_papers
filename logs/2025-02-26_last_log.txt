Text:"Scale-Distribution Decoupling: Enabling Stable and Effective Training of Large Language Models Ya Wang * 1 Zhijian Zhuo * 1 2 Yutao Zeng * 1 Xun Zhou 1 Jian Yang Xiaoqing Li 3 5 2 0 2 5 2 ] . [ 2 9 9 4 5 1 . 2 0 5 2 : r aTraining stability is persistent challenge in the pre-training of large language models (LLMs), particularly for architectures such as Post-Norm Transformers, which are prone to gradient explosion and dissipation. In this paper, we propose Scale-Distribution Decoupling (SDD), novel approach that stabilizes training by explicitly decoupling the scale and distribution of the weight matrix in fully-connected layers. SDD applies normalization mechanism to regulate activations and learnable scaling vector to maintain well-conditioned gradients, effectively preventing gradient explosion and dissipation. This separation improves optimization efficiency, particularly in deep networks, by ensuring stable gradient propagation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method stabilizes training across various LLM architectures and outperforms existing techniques in different normalization configurations. Furthermore, the proposed method is lightweight and compatible with existing frameworks, making it practical solution for stabilizing LLM training. Code is available at https: //github.com/kaihemo/SDD. 1. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks (Li et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2025), fueled by advances in model architectures, large-scale datasets, and computational resources. However, the training stability of LLMs remains critical challenge, especially as model size and complexity continue to grow. Instabilities during pre-training often lead to issues such as gradient explosion, vanishing gradients, or optimization stagnation, *Equal contribution Project lead 1Seed-Foundation-Model, ByteDance 2School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University 3Capital University of Economics and Business. Correspondence to: Xiaoqing Li <xqli@cueb.edu.cn>. Figure 1. Training/validation loss with downstream performance on HellaSwag and PIQA for 1B dense models trained with 2T tokens: SDD-1B (Post-Norm) achieves superior convergence (1.5) and generalization over OLMo2-1B (Pre-Norm). hindering the efficient and effective training of these models. Although Pre-Norm Transformer (Xiong et al., 2020; Zhuo et al., 2025) architectures exhibit greater stability during training, they suffer from feature collapse (Wang et al., 2024a; Xie et al., 2023), where representations across different layers become increasingly similar as depth increases. This phenomenon may contribute to the scaling bottleneck in large models. On the other hand, Post-Norm configurations remain significantly more difficult to train, exhibiting severe gradient explosion or vanishing issues, making stability in such settings challenge in LLM research. fundamental source of these instabilities lies in the complexity of optimizing weight matrices in high-dimensional spaces. Specifically, the scale of weight parameters becomes challenging to regulate as the matrix grows in size, making convergence increasingly delicate. While existing strategies, such as sophisticated initialization schemes (Zhang et al., 2019) and normalization techniques (Ding et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2020), offer partial mitigation, they fail to resolve the core issue: the entanglement between the weight matrixs scale and distribution. This coupling induces suboptimal optimization dynamics, amplifying training insta1 Scale-Distribution Decoupling: Enabling Stable and Effective Training of Large Language Models bilities, particularly in large-scale models where gradient propagation is susceptible to divergence or attenuation. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Scale-Distribution Decoupling (SDD), novel approach that restructures fullyconnected layers to explicitly separate the scale and distribution of weight matrices. In contrast to conventional formulations, SDD applies normalization step to standardize activations, ensuring optimization focuses on learning the distribution rather than jointly optimizing both scale and distribution. Additionally, learnable scaling vector is introduced to control the overall magnitude of activations, preventing gradient explosion and dissipation. This decoupling leads to more stable gradient propagation, enhancing both convergence efficiency and model robustness. SDD is lightweight, requires minimal architectural modifications, and seamlessly integrates with wide range of model configurations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SDD significantly improves training stability across various LLM architectures, including notoriously unstable Post-Norm Transformers. Furthermore, SDD accelerates convergence, improves generalization, and enables efficient large-scale pre-training, making it practical and effective solution for stabilizing LLM training. This work makes the following key contributions: 1. We introduce novel design that explicitly decouples the scale and distribution of weight matrices, addressing fundamental limitation in LLM optimization. 2. We empirically demonstrate that SDD stabilizes training across diverse LLM architectures, including both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm configurations, mitigating issues such as gradient explosion and dissipation. 3. We provide empirical evidence showing that our method improves both convergence stability and training efficiency, making it highly applicable to largescale pre-training tasks. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 elaborates on the proposed methodology in detail. Section 3 provides theoretical analysis of the principles underpinning SDD. Experimental results and an in-depth analysis are presented in Section 4. Section 5 discusses related work on training stability and normalization techniques for large language models. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper with key insights and potential directions for future research. 2. Scale-Distribution Decoupling 2.1.

The rapid advancements in computing dramatically increase the scale and cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs). Accurately predicting downstream task performance prior to model training is crucial for efficient resource allocation, yet remains challenging due to two primary constraints: (1) the "emergence phenomenon", wherein downstream performance metrics become meaningful only after extensive training, which limits the ability to use smaller models for prediction; (2) Uneven task difficulty distributions and the absence of consistent scaling laws, resulting in substantial metric variability. Existing performance prediction methods suffer from limited accuracy and reliability, thereby impeding the assessment of potential LLM capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) downstream performance prediction framework. COD first constructs a predictable support subset by clustering tasks based on difficulty features, strategically excluding non-emergent and non-scalable clusters. The scores on the selected subset serve as effective intermediate predictors of downstream performance on the full evaluation set. With theoretical support, we derive a mapping function that transforms performance metrics from the predictable subset to the full evaluation set, thereby ensuring accurate extrapolation of LLM downstream performance. The proposed method has been applied to predict performance scaling for a 70B LLM, providing actionable insights for training resource allocation and assisting in monitoring the training process. Notably, COD achieves remarkable predictive accuracy on the 70B LLM by leveraging an ensemble of small models, demonstrating an absolute mean deviation of 1.36% across eight important LLM evaluation benchmarks.

"The rapid advancements in computing dramatically increase the scale and cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs). Accurately predicting downstream task performance prior to model training is crucial for efficient resource allocation, yet remains challenging due to two primary constraints: (1) the "emergence phenomenon", wherein downstream performance metrics become meaningful only after extensive training, which limits the ability to use smaller models for prediction; (2) Uneven task difficulty distributions and the absence of consistent scaling laws, resulting in substantial metric variability. Existing performance prediction methods suffer from limited accuracy and reliability, thereby impeding the assessment of potential LLM capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) downstream performance prediction framework. COD first constructs a predictable support subset by clustering tasks based on difficulty features, strategically excluding non-emergent and non-scalable clusters. The scores on the selected subset serve as effective intermediate predictors of downstream performance on the full evaluation set. With theoretical support, we derive a mapping function that transforms performance metrics from the predictable subset to the full evaluation set, thereby ensuring accurate extrapolation of LLM downstream performance. The proposed method has been applied to predict performance scaling for a 70B LLM, providing actionable insights for training resource allocation and assisting in monitoring the training process. Notably, COD achieves remarkable predictive accuracy on the 70B LLM by leveraging an ensemble of small models, demonstrating an absolute mean deviation of 1.36% across eight important LLM evaluation benchmarks."

Training stability is a persistent challenge in the pre-training of large language models (LLMs), particularly for architectures such as Post-Norm Transformers, which are prone to gradient explosion and dissipation. In this paper, we propose Scale-Distribution Decoupling (SDD), a novel approach that stabilizes training by explicitly decoupling the scale and distribution of the weight matrix in fully-connected layers. SDD applies a normalization mechanism to regulate activations and a learnable scaling vector to maintain well-conditioned gradients, effectively preventing gradient explosion and dissipation. This separation improves optimization efficiency, particularly in deep networks, by ensuring stable gradient propagation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method stabilizes training across various LLM architectures and outperforms existing techniques in different normalization configurations. Furthermore, the proposed method is lightweight and compatible with existing frameworks, making it a practical solution for stabilizing LLM training. Code is available at https://github.com/kaihemo/SDD.

Auditory foundation models, including auditory large language models (LLMs), process all sound inputs equally, independent of listener perception. However, human auditory perception is inherently selective: listeners focus on specific speakers while ignoring others in complex auditory scenes. Existing models do not incorporate this selectivity, limiting their ability to generate perception-aligned responses. To address this, we introduce Intention-Informed Auditory Scene Understanding (II-ASU) and present Auditory Attention-Driven LLM (AAD-LLM), a prototype system that integrates brain signals to infer listener attention. AAD-LLM extends an auditory LLM by incorporating intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings to decode which speaker a listener is attending to and refine responses accordingly. The model first predicts the attended speaker from neural activity, then conditions response generation on this inferred attentional state. We evaluate AAD-LLM on speaker description, speech transcription and extraction, and question answering in multitalker scenarios, with both objective and subjective ratings showing improved alignment with listener intention. By taking a first step toward intention-aware auditory AI, this work explores a new paradigm where listener perception informs machine listening, paving the way for future listener-centered auditory systems.

We introduce WebGames, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate general-purpose web-browsing AI agents through a collection of 50+ interactive challenges. These challenges are specifically crafted to be straightforward for humans while systematically testing the limitations of current AI systems across fundamental browser interactions, advanced input processing, cognitive tasks, workflow automation, and interactive entertainment. Our framework eliminates external dependencies through a hermetic testing environment, ensuring reproducible evaluation with verifiable ground-truth solutions. We evaluate leading vision-language models including GPT-4o, Claude Computer-Use, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and Qwen2-VL against human performance. Results reveal a substantial capability gap, with the best AI system achieving only 43.1% success rate compared to human performance of 95.7%, highlighting fundamental limitations in current AI systems' ability to handle common web interaction patterns that humans find intuitive. The benchmark is publicly available at webgames.convergence.ai, offering a lightweight, client-side implementation that facilitates rapid evaluation cycles. Through its modular architecture and standardized challenge specifications, WebGames provides a robust foundation for measuring progress in development of more capable web-browsing agents.

Our framework eliminates external dependencies through a hermetic testing environment, ensuring reproducible evaluation with verifiable ground-truth solutions. We evaluate leading vision-language models including GPT-4o, Claude Computer-Use, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and Qwen2-VL against human performance. Results reveal a substantial capability gap, with the best AI system achieving only 43.1% success rate compared to human performance of 95.7%, highlighting fundamental limitations in current AI systems' ability to handle common web interaction patterns that humans find intuitive. The benchmark is publicly available at webgames.convergence.ai, offering a lightweight, client-side implementation that facilitates rapid evaluation cycles. Through its modular architecture and standardized challenge specifications, WebGames provides a robust foundation for measuring progress in development of more capable web-browsing agents."
