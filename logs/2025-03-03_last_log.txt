Text:"Multi-Turn Code Generation Through Single-Step Rewards Arnav Kumar Jain * 1 2 Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega * 3 Wayne Chen 3 Alexander Rush 3 Wenting Zhao 3 Sanjiban Choudhury 3 5 2 0 2 7 2 ] . [ 1 0 8 3 0 2 . 2 0 5 2 : r aWe address the problem of code generation from multi-turn execution feedback. Existing methods either generate code without feedback or use complex, hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize multi-turn rewards. We propose simple yet scalable approach, µCODE, that solves multi-turn code generation using only single-step rewards. Our key insight is that code generation is one-step recoverable MDP, where the correct code can be recovered from any intermediate code state in single turn. µCODE iteratively trains both generator to provide code solutions conditioned on multi-turn execution feedback and verifier to score the newly generated code. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves significant improvements over the stateof-the-art baselines. We provide analysis of the design choices of the reward models and policy, and show the efficacy of µCODE at utilizing the execution feedback. Our code is available here. 1. Introduction Software engineers often iteratively refine their code based on execution errors. common strategy for machine code generation is thus to repair code using execution feedback at test time (Chen et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b; Zhao et al., 2024). However, prompting alone is insufficient as it cannot teach how to recover from all possible errors within limited context. We need to train models that can learn from execution feedback during training. Existing approaches fall into either single-turn or multi-turn settings. In the single-turn setting, methods either train without execution feedback (Zelikman et al., 2022) or perform one-step corrections (Welleck et al., 2023; Ni et al., 2024). However, these struggle to iteratively *Equal contributionEqual advising 1MilaQuebec AI Institute 2Universite de Montreal 3Cornell University. Correspondence to: Arnav <arnav-kumar.jain@mila.quebec>, Gonzalo <gg387@cornell.edu>. Preprint. 1 correct errors over multiple turns. Multi-turn approaches, on the other hand, rely on complex reinforcement learning (RL) (Gehring et al., 2024a; Kumar et al., 2024b; Zhou et al., 2024) to optimize long-term rewards. While effective in principle, these methods suffer from sparse learning signals which makes learning inefficient. Our key insight is that code generation is one-step recoverable Markov Decision Process (MDP), implying that the correct code can be recovered from any intermediate state in single step. This allows us to greedily maximize onestep reward instead of relying on complex multi-step reward optimization. As result, this reduces the problem from reinforcement learning, which requires exploration and credit assignment, to imitation learning, where the model simply learns to mimic correct code, leading to more stable and efficient training process. We propose µCODE, simple and scalable approach for multi-turn code generation from execution feedback. During training, µCODE follows an expert iteration (Anthony et al., 2017) framework with local search expert, enabling iterative improvement of both the generator and the expert. The process begins by rolling out the current code generator to collect interaction data with execution feedback. single-step verifier is then trained on this data and utilized to guide local search expert in refining the code and generating training labels. Finally, the generator is fine-tuned using these labels. Given recent trends of test-time scaling in generating high quality solutions (Brown et al., 2024; Snell et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024), µCODE also uses the learned verifier for inference-time scaling. Here, µCODE samples trajectories; at each step, µCODE picks the best code solution ranked by the learned verifier. The key contributions of this work are as follows: 1. novel framework, µCODE, for training code generators and verifiers through multi-turn execution feedback. We add theoretical analysis of performance bounds using the property of one-step recoverability for this task. 2. We propose multi-turn Best-of-N (BoN) approach for inference-time scaling and present benefits of learned verifier to select the code solution at each turn. 3. Our approach µCODE outperforms leading multi-turn approaches on MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) and HuMulti-Turn Code Generation Through Single-Step Rewards Figure 1. (a) We define the task of multi-turn code generation where for an initial problem x, the generator πθ provides solution y1. This solution is evaluated with the public test to get execution feedback o1. At turn t, the generator is conditioned on the history to generate solution yt πθ(.x, y<t, o<t). The rollout ends when the turn limit is reached or the public tests pass upon which the solution is executed on private tests. Since, the agents can generate the optimal solution at any turn, this is 1-step recoverable process. (b) Training loop of our method µCODE which comprises of generator and learned verifier. During each iteration, rollouts are collected using πθ and we train verifier Rϕ to rank candidate solutions for prompt. The verifier Rϕ is then used to construct local expert and relabel the collected rollouts. Lastly, the generator is fine-tuned with this expert dataset. manEval (Chen et al., 2021) benchmarks. Our ablations demonstrate that learned verifiers aid in learning better generators and show promising scaling law trends with higher inference budgets. {x, y1, o1, . . . , yt1, ot1} where s1 = {x}, and the action is the code at = yt. The oracle reward is defined as R(st, at) = R(x, at) = C(x, yt) if yt passes all public and private tests (terminating the episode), or 0 otherwise. 2. Background Multi-turn Code Generation as MDP. In multi-turn code generation, an agent iteratively refines program to maximize its correctness on private test cases. Given an initial problem prompt x, at each turn t, the agent generates complete code snippet yt and executes it on set of public tests. The outcomes ot from these tests serve as observations that guide subsequent refinements. This process continues until the agent generates code snippet yt that passes all public tests, at which point the episode terminates, or until the maximum number of turns is reached without success. The first successful code, yt, is then evaluated on private tests to compute the correctnes"

We address the problem of code generation from multi-turn execution feedback. Existing methods either generate code without feedback or use complex, hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize multi-turn rewards. We propose a simple yet scalable approach, muCode, that solves multi-turn code generation using only single-step rewards. Our key insight is that code generation is a one-step recoverable MDP, where the correct code can be recovered from any intermediate code state in a single turn. muCode iteratively trains both a generator to provide code solutions conditioned on multi-turn execution feedback and a verifier to score the newly generated code. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines. We provide analysis of the design choices of the reward models and policy, and show the efficacy of muCode at utilizing the execution feedback. Our code is available at https://github.com/portal-cornell/muCode.

Applying large language models (LLMs) to assist in psycho-counseling is an emerging and meaningful approach, driven by the significant gap between patient needs and the availability of mental health support. However, current LLMs struggle to consistently provide effective responses to client speeches, largely due to the lack of supervision from high-quality real psycho-counseling data, whose content is typically inaccessible due to client privacy concerns. Furthermore, the quality of therapists' responses in available sessions can vary significantly based on their professional training and experience. Assessing the quality of therapists' responses remains an open challenge. In this work, we address these challenges by first proposing a set of professional and comprehensive principles to evaluate therapists' responses to client speeches. Using these principles, we create a preference dataset, PsychoCounsel-Preference, which contains 36k high-quality preference comparison pairs. This dataset aligns with the preferences of professional psychotherapists, providing a robust foundation for evaluating and improving LLMs in psycho-counseling. Experiments on reward modeling and preference learning demonstrate that PsychoCounsel-Preference is an excellent resource for LLMs to acquire essential skills for responding to clients in a counseling session. Our best-aligned model, PsychoCounsel-Llama3-8B, achieves an impressive win rate of 87% against GPT-4o. We release PsychoCounsel-Preference, PsychoCounsel-Llama3-8B and the reward model PsychoCounsel Llama3-8B-Reward to facilitate the research of psycho-counseling with LLMs at: https://hf.co/Psychotherapy-LLM.
