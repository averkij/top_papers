We propose Samba ASR, the first state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model leveraging the novel Mamba architecture as both encoder and decoder, built on the foundation of state-space models (SSMs). Unlike transformer-based ASR models, which rely on self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies, Samba ASR effectively models both local and global temporal dependencies using efficient state-space dynamics, achieving remarkable performance gains. By addressing the limitations of transformers, such as quadratic scaling with input length and difficulty in handling long-range dependencies, Samba ASR achieves superior accuracy and efficiency.   Experimental results demonstrate that Samba ASR surpasses existing open-source transformer-based ASR models across various standard benchmarks, establishing it as the new state of the art in ASR. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER), with competitive performance even in low-resource scenarios. Furthermore, the computational efficiency and parameter optimization of the Mamba architecture make Samba ASR a scalable and robust solution for diverse ASR tasks.   Our contributions include:   A new Samba ASR architecture demonstrating the superiority of SSMs over transformer-based models for speech sequence processing. A comprehensive evaluation on public benchmarks showcasing state-of-the-art performance. An analysis of computational efficiency, robustness to noise, and sequence generalization. This work highlights the viability of Mamba SSMs as a transformer-free alternative for efficient and accurate ASR. By leveraging state-space modeling advancements, Samba ASR sets a new benchmark for ASR performance and future research.

4D video control is essential in video generation as it enables the use of sophisticated lens techniques, such as multi-camera shooting and dolly zoom, which are currently unsupported by existing methods. Training a video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly to control 4D content requires expensive multi-view videos. Inspired by Monocular Dynamic novel View Synthesis (MDVS) that optimizes a 4D representation and renders videos according to different 4D elements, such as camera pose and object motion editing, we bring pseudo 4D Gaussian fields to video generation. Specifically, we propose a novel framework that constructs a pseudo 4D Gaussian field with dense 3D point tracking and renders the Gaussian field for all video frames. Then we finetune a pretrained DiT to generate videos following the guidance of the rendered video, dubbed as GS-DiT. To boost the training of the GS-DiT, we also propose an efficient Dense 3D Point Tracking (D3D-PT) method for the pseudo 4D Gaussian field construction. Our D3D-PT outperforms SpatialTracker, the state-of-the-art sparse 3D point tracking method, in accuracy and accelerates the inference speed by two orders of magnitude. During the inference stage, GS-DiT can generate videos with the same dynamic content while adhering to different camera parameters, addressing a significant limitation of current video generation models. GS-DiT demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and extends the 4D controllability of Gaussian splatting to video generation beyond just camera poses. It supports advanced cinematic effects through the manipulation of the Gaussian field and camera intrinsics, making it a powerful tool for creative video production. Demos are available at https://wkbian.github.io/Projects/GS-DiT/.

  "desc": "Эта статья представляет инновационный подход к генерации видео с 4D-контролем, используя псевдо-4D гауссовы поля и модель Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Авторы предлагают метод Dense 3D Point Tracking (D3D-PT) для эффективного построения гауссовых полей, превосходящий существующие решения по точности и скорости. Разработанная система GS-DiT позволяет генерировать видео с одинаковым динамическим содержанием, но с разными параметрами камеры, что открывает новые возможности для создания кинематографических эффектов. Метод демонстрирует сильные обобщающие способности и расширяет возможности 4D-контроля в генерации видео.",

"4D video control is essential in video generation as it enables the use of sophisticated lens techniques, such as multi-camera shooting and dolly zoom, which are currently unsupported by existing methods. Training a video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly to control 4D content requires expensive multi-view videos. Inspired by Monocular Dynamic novel View Synthesis (MDVS) that optimizes a 4D representation and renders videos according to different 4D elements, such as camera pose and object motion editing, we bring pseudo 4D Gaussian fields to video generation. Specifically, we propose a novel framework that constructs a pseudo 4D Gaussian field with dense 3D point tracking and renders the Gaussian field for all video frames. Then we finetune a pretrained DiT to generate videos following the guidance of the rendered video, dubbed as GS-DiT. To boost the training of the GS-DiT, we also propose an efficient Dense 3D Point Tracking (D3D-PT) method for the pseudo 4D Gaussian field construction. Our D3D-PT outperforms SpatialTracker, the state-of-the-art sparse 3D point tracking method, in accuracy and accelerates the inference speed by two orders of magnitude. During the inference stage, GS-DiT can generate videos with the same dynamic content while adhering to different camera parameters, addressing a significant limitation of current video generation models. GS-DiT demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and extends the 4D controllability of Gaussian splatting to video generation beyond just camera poses. It supports advanced cinematic effects through the manipulation of the Gaussian field and camera intrinsics, making it a powerful tool for creative video production. Demos are available at https://wkbian.github.io/Projects/GS-DiT/."
