INTRODUCTION ONOCULAR depth estimation (MDE) has garnered considerable attention due to its simplicity, low cost, and ease of deployment. Unlike traditional depth-sensing techniques such as LiDAR or stereo vision, MDE only requires single RGB image as input, making it highly appealing for wide range of applications, including autonomous driving [1] [4], virtual reality [5], [6], and image synthesis [7], [8]. This versatility also presents significant challenge: achieving exceptional generalization to effectively handle the diversity and complexity of broad-range application scenarios. However, this is non-trivial task due to variants in scene layouts, depth distributions, lighting conditions, etc. *Equal contribution. Corresponding authors.

This work was done during Ziyang Songs internship at vivo. Recent research on zero-shot monocular depth estimation has primarily evolved into two main branches: data-driven [9] [15] and model-driven [16][20]. The former relies on largescale image-depth pairs to achieve the mapping from image to depth, where the process of data collecting and training is extremely time-consuming and resource-exhausting. In contrast, model-driven approaches aim to leverage pre-trained backbones, particularly in the context of Stable Diffusion models [21], [22]. For example, Marigold [16] reformulates depth estimation as diffusion-denoising process, achieving impressive performance in both generalization and detail preservation. However, the iterative denoising process results in low inference speed. GenPercept [19] proposes deterministic single-step paradigm, that is, directly inputting RGB images and outputting depth maps, reducing inference time with comparable performance. Despite these advancements in applying diffusion models to MDE, few works have thoroughly explored how to best adapt the generative features in diffusion models for the discriminative task. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the feature representation within diffusion models. Typically, diffusion models consist of an image-to-latent (I2L) encoder-decoder and denoising network. The former compresses images into the latent space and reconstructs them, while the latter perceives and reasons about the scene. Experimentally, we find that the main bottleneck lies in the feature representation capability of the denoising network. In fact, the reconstruction task used to pre-train the denoising network induces the model to prioritize texture details over structure, leading to unrealistic textures in depth predictions (see Fig. 1, Column 3, yellow boxes). Therefore, how to enhance the feature representation capacity of the denoising network and reduce its reliance on irrelevant details is key issue for taming diffusion models for depth estimation. Furthermore, the high visual quality of diffusion models outputs comes from the iterative refinement process. In the early steps, the model learns to recover the general structure, while in later steps, details are gradually refined. When reformulated as singlestep paradigm, the model struggles to learn both primary structure and fine details in single forward pass, leading to blurry predictions (see Fig. 1, Column 4, red boxes). Thus, how to improve the fine-grained details in the singlestep framework is another crucial challenge in leveraging the generative features for depth estimation. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose DepthMaster, tamed single-step diffusion model designed to enhance the generalization and detail preservation abilitiesStage 1 Stage 2 Fig. 1. Visualization of different paradigms. Denoise refers to predicting depth in diffusion-denoising way. Limited by the feature representation capability of the denoising network, predictions tend to overfit texture details and miss the real structure, as highlighted with yellow boxes in Column 3. Stage1 alleviates this issue with the Feature Alignment module, but suffers from blurry outputs due to removing the iterative process, as highlighted with red boxes in Column 4. Stage2 presents the final model fine-tuned with the Fourier Enhancement module"

Monocular depth estimation within the diffusion-denoising paradigm demonstrates impressive generalization ability but suffers from low inference speed. Recent methods adopt a single-step deterministic paradigm to improve inference efficiency while maintaining comparable performance. However, they overlook the gap between generative and discriminative features, leading to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose DepthMaster, a single-step diffusion model designed to adapt generative features for the discriminative depth estimation task. First, to mitigate overfitting to texture details introduced by generative features, we propose a Feature Alignment module, which incorporates high-quality semantic features to enhance the denoising network's representation capability. Second, to address the lack of fine-grained details in the single-step deterministic framework, we propose a Fourier Enhancement module to adaptively balance low-frequency structure and high-frequency details. We adopt a two-stage training strategy to fully leverage the potential of the two modules. In the first stage, we focus on learning the global scene structure with the Feature Alignment module, while in the second stage, we exploit the Fourier Enhancement module to improve the visual quality. Through these efforts, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of generalization and detail preservation, outperforming other diffusion-based methods across various datasets.
