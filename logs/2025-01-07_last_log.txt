Text:"AUTO-RT: Automatic Jailbreak Strategy Exploration for Red-Teaming Large Language Models Yanjiang Liu 1 2 Shuheng Zhou 3 Yaojie Lu 1 Huijia Zhu 3 Weiqiang Wang 3 Hongyu Lin 1 Ben He 1 2 Xianpei Han 1 Le SunAutomated red-teaming has become crucial approach for uncovering vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs). However, most existing methods focus on isolated safety flaws, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic defenses and uncover complex vulnerabilities efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose AUTO-RT, reinforcement learning framework that automatically explores and optimizes complex attack strategies to effectively uncover security vulnerabilities through malicious queries. Specifically, we introduce two key mechanisms to reduce exploration complexity and improve strategy optimization: 1) Early-terminated Exploration, which accelerate exploration by focusing on high-potential attack strategies; and 2) Progressive Reward Tracking algorithm with intermediate downgrade models, which dynamically refine the search trajectory toward successful vulnerability exploitation. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs demonstrate that, by significantly improving exploration efficiency and automatically optimizing attack strategies, AUTO-RT detects boarder range of vulnerabilities, achieving faster detection speed and 16.63% higher success rates compared to existing methods.

[ 1 0 3 8 1 0 . 1 0 5 2 : r The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023) has significantly increased the demand for effective safety alignment to mitigate the risks associated with their misuse. Although extensive safety tuning has enabled LLMs to demonstrate alignment with human values (Lee 1Chinese Information Processing Laboratory, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China 2University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China 3Ant Group. Correspondence to: Shuheng Zhou <shuheng.zsh@antgroup.com>, Yaojie Lu <luyaojie@iscas.ac.cn>. Figure 1: Comparison between previous red-teaming approaches and AUTO-RT. Previous works focused on identifying safety flaws of the target model under given attack strategies, whereas AUTO-RT directly explores systematic safety flaws in target models starting from searching strategies itself, enabling fully automated process. et al., 2024; Qi et al., 2024), these models, as inherently complex systems, still harbor numerous undiscovered vulnerabilities (Allspaw & Cook, 2010). Identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities is critical for ensuring the reliability and robustness of LLMs, particularly as they are increasingly deployed in sensitive applications. However, as LLMs evolve and their use cases diversify, progress in this area has become more resource-intensive and constrained by human expertise. The safety vulnerabilities are typically evaluated based on their severity (potential harm caused) and exploitability (ease of triggering) (Bishop & Bailey, 1996; Bozorgi et al., 2010; Bhatt et al., 2021). Manual identification of safety vulnerabilities has focused on uncovering those with high exploitability, such as well-known attacks like Grandmas spell and past-tense attack (Andriushchenko & Flammarion, 2024), which bypass safety constraints in aligned models through contextual frameworks. In contrast, automated vulnerability discovery referred to as automatic red-teaming tends to emphasize high-severity vulnerabilities. For instance, methods like CRT (Hong et al., 2024) and Diver-CT (Zhao et al., 2024) employ reinforcement learning to randomly generate semantically diverse attack prompts. Other methods, such as AutoDAN (Liu et al., 1 AUTO-RT: Automatic Jailbreak Strategy Exploration for Red-Teaming Large Language Models 2024b), Rainbow-Teaming (Samvelyan et al., 2024) and PAIR (Chao et al., 2024), leverage predefined attack strategies targeting specific hazardous behaviors. For multi-target attacks, GCG-Multi (Zou et al., 2023) introduced optimized universal suffixes to attack multiple objectives. However, due to the poor readability of these suffixes, their practical exploitability is limited. To address these challenges, we propose AUTO-RT, novel framework for automatic strategic red-teaming that prioritizes the discovery of high-exploitability safety vulnerabilities while maintaining balance between severity and efficiency. Unlike traditional methods that depend on predefined toxic behaviors or fixed attack strategies, AUTO-RT autonomously discovers high-exploitability attack strategies from scratch. This removes the reliance on human intervention or predefined attack scopes, enabling the framework to uncover novel vulnerabilities. Operating in black-box setting, AUTO-RT requires only access to models textual outputs, making it highly adaptable to broad spectrum of LLMs without necessitating internal model access. Its compatibility with both white-box and black-box models, including large-scale LLMs, highlights its versatility. Furthermore, we design two algorithms to reduce exploration complexity and improve strategy optimization in AUTO-RT. First, to optimize resource utilization during the exploration process, AUTO-RT employs an earlytermination mechanism within Early-terminated Exploration framework. This mechanism dynamically assesses the progress of exploration, halting unproductive paths in real-time and redirecting resources toward more promising strategies. This approach enhances computational efficiency and improves the precision of vulnerability discovery. Second, to further enhance the efficiency of strategy exploration, AUTO-RT employs Progressive Reward Tracking mechanism that leverages novel metric, First Inverse Rate (FIR), to select degrade model to densify safety reward signals (Ng et al., 1999) from the target models outputs. This innovation accelerates convergence and improves exploration outcomes, enabling AUTO-RT to navigate the extensive search space of potential attack strategies effectively. Extensive evaluations on 16 white-box models and two 70B black-box models demonstrate that AUTO-RT achieves superior effectiveness, efficiency, and diversity in generating attack strategies, establishing new standard in automated red-teaming. In summary, the contributions are as follows: 1. We propose novel framework for automated strategy generation red-teaming, eliminati"

Effective evaluation of multi-hop tool use is critical for analyzing the understanding, reasoning, and function-calling capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, progress has been hindered by a lack of reliable evaluation datasets. To address this, we present ToolHop, a dataset comprising 995 user queries and 3,912 associated tools, specifically designed for rigorous evaluation of multi-hop tool use. ToolHop ensures diverse queries, meaningful interdependencies, locally executable tools, detailed feedback, and verifiable answers through a novel query-driven data construction approach that includes tool creation, document refinement, and code generation. We evaluate 14 LLMs across five model families (i.e., LLaMA3.1, Qwen2.5, Gemini1.5, Claude3.5, and GPT), uncovering significant challenges in handling multi-hop tool-use scenarios. The leading model, GPT-4o, achieves an accuracy of 49.04%, underscoring substantial room for improvement. Further analysis reveals variations in tool-use strategies for various families, offering actionable insights to guide the development of more effective approaches. Code and data can be found in https://huggingface.co/bytedance-research/ToolHop.
