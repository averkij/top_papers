[ 1 3 2 4 2 0 . 1 0 5 2 : r aLow-precision training is considered an effective strategy for reducing both training and downstream inference costs. Previous scaling laws for precision mainly focus on integer quantization, which pay less attention to the constituents in floating-point quantization and thus cannot well fit the LLM losses in this scenario. In contrast, while floating-point quantization training is more commonly implemented in production, the research on it has been relatively superficial. In this paper, we thoroughly explore the effects of floating-point quantization targets, exponent bits, mantissa bits, and the calculation granularity of the scaling factor in floating-point quantization training performance of LLM models. While presenting an accurate floating-point quantization unified scaling law, we also provide valuable suggestions for the community: (1) Exponent bits contribute slightly more to the model performance than mantissa bits. We provide the optimal exponent-mantissa bit ratio for different bit numbers, which is available for future reference by hardware manufacturers; (2) We discover the formation of the critical data size in low-precision LLM training. Too much training data exceeding the critical data size will inversely bring in degradation of LLM performance; (3) The optimal floating-point quantization precision is directly proportional to the computational power, but within wide computational power range, we estimate that the best cost-performance precision lies between 4-8 bits. 1.

The widely acknowledged scaling law efforts such as Kaplan et al. (2020), Hoffmann et al. (2022), and Li et al. (2024) mainly concentrate on the central factors, i.e., model size and trained token size, which significantly impact the performance of LLMs. With the rapid growth of both model and data sizes, there has been increasing attention to the efficiency and cost of LLM training. Training and serving with lower precision becomes popular solution. Currently, lots of representative LLMs are trained in BF16 and even lower precision (Dubey et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023), aiming to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Compared to integer quantization, floatingpoint (FP) quantization can better maintain LLMs accuracy at extremely lower bit rates and thus is often equipped in low-precision LLMs. Therefore, exploring the scaling laws of LLM performance under different low precision settings with floating-point quantization becomes essential to shed light on future low-precision LLM training. Recently, there is pioneer work that conducts in-depth analyses and explorations on the LLMs scaling laws for precision in both training and inference (Kumar et al., 2024), quantitatively measuring the degradation rules of post-train quantization and quantized training. This scaling law provides an appropriate conclusion explaining the potential damage of excessively increasing training data to low-precision LLMs performance. However, Kumar et al. (2024) directly adopts the bit width as the precision in its low-precision scaling laws, which may lose finer-grained modeling of the relationship between various parameter settings related to the FP quantization and the final loss of LLMs. In practice, the key factors of FP quantization such as the exponent, mantissa, and the block size of scaling factors may have different impacts on the final loss. more comprehensive, precise, and practical scaling law for float quantized training related to the data size (D), model size (N), exponent (E), mantissa (M), and block size of scaling factors (B) is urgently desired. Our work concentrates on establishing, verifying, and analyzing the scaling law for float quantized training in LLMs. Scaling Laws for FloatingPoint Quantization Training At the beginning, we first predict the model performance via the precision-related scaling law from previous work under different data/model sizes and precision settings. Surprisingly, we discover that the predictive performance was not perfectly satisfactory under different float quantized training settings. Subsequently, we carefully design comprehensive set of explorations with experiments of different precision settings (training 366 models), exploring the basic scaling law formation, as well as the potential impact of the quantization targets, exponent and mantissa, and block sizes on the loss. Finally, we aggregate these factors to get our final scaling law for float quantized training with valuable insights to guide the LLM training under low precision. Our scaling law is formulated as follows: L(N, D, E, M, B) = + Dβ + ϵ α + Dβ α log2 γ(E + 0.5)δ(M + 0.5)ν . (1) The first two factors and indicate the data size and model size respectively, which show the main impacts on training loss given by the key factors of data and model size similar with the Chinchilla scaling law (Hoffmann et al., 2022). ϵ represents the bias. The last factor could be regarded as the additional negative impact deriving from low precision training, where Dβ α implies certain form of knowledge intensity in LLM, and log2 B, (E + 0.5)δ, and (M + 0.5)ν jointly reflect the low precision information loss of float quantized training. We have conducted extensive fitting experiments with various possible scaling law formulations to ensure the accuracy and simplicity of our scaling laws. Note that the exponential hyper-parameters α and β of model and data sizes are exactly the same as those in the first two factors. The product of the above knowledge intensity and low precision information loss forms the last factor. Figure 1 and Figure 8 illustrates the fitting results of our scaling law compa"

Low-precision training is considered an effective strategy for reducing both training and downstream inference costs. Previous scaling laws for precision mainly focus on integer quantization, which pay less attention to the constituents in floating-point quantization and thus cannot well fit the LLM losses in this scenario. In contrast, while floating-point quantization training is more commonly implemented in production, the research on it has been relatively superficial. In this paper, we thoroughly explore the effects of floating-point quantization targets, exponent bits, mantissa bits, and the calculation granularity of the scaling factor in floating-point quantization training performance of LLM models. While presenting an accurate floating-point quantization unified scaling law, we also provide valuable suggestions for the community: (1) Exponent bits contribute slightly more to the model performance than mantissa bits. We provide the optimal exponent-mantissa bit ratio for different bit numbers, which is available for future reference by hardware manufacturers; (2) We discover the formation of the critical data size in low-precision LLM training. Too much training data exceeding the critical data size will inversely bring in degradation of LLM performance; (3) The optimal floating-point quantization precision is directly proportional to the computational power, but within a wide computational power range, we estimate that the best cost-performance precision lies between 4-8 bits.
