Our demo video is available at https://youtu.be/8VWZXpERRThe development of interactive world models has emerged as crucial research area in recent studies [64, 17, 34]. These virtual environments aim to simulate real-world complex scenarios, enabling researchers to gather rich observations through extensive and meaningful interactions. Given that obtaining real-world data is typically challenging and expensive, the abundant data generated by world models can be leveraged to train various artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms [52, 72], especially those requiring high sample complexity. Furthermore, world models are particularly valuable for learning problems that involve safety and risk considerations.

The empirical significance of world models necessitates developing high-fidelity 3D virtual environments, aiming to minimize the sim-to-real gap between simulation and reality. By doing so, we can generate rich data that better aligns with real-world samples, significantly mitigating the learning errors that arise from the sim-to-real gap. The development of such high-fidelity virtual environments fundamentally requires the study of 3D scene generation techniques. Early efforts in this field began with basic manual scene modeling, primarily in applications like game development, which largely relied on manual crafting by artists with high labor costs. To enhance production efficiency, procedural content generation (PCG) has become widely used in computer graphics for the automatic creation of 3D virtual environments through algorithms and predefined rules [58, 4, 15, 3, 11, 66]. With the advancement of deep learning, there has been extensive research on integrating PCG with deep neural networks [44, 23, 31]. Recently, researchers are particularly focused on using generative models to create content based on user instructions. Neural rendering methods represent an important line of research, such as Score Distillation Sampling with Neural Radiance Fields [36, 38, 54, 19, 33, 71, 13, 69] and 3D Gaussian Splatting [22, 68, 7, 74, 25]. However, these approaches lack interactive capabilities, which constrains their practical applications. Another line of research, developed based on diffusion models [14, 26, 17, 34, 9], provides vision-based (e.g., images or videos) solutions for scene generation. Moreover, there have been many works focusing on integrating generative models with 3D modeling platforms[55, 73, 20, 10, 52, 65, 67], especially Blender. Our work advances this field by proposing novel framework named LatticeWorld, multimodal large language model-empowered framework for interactive complex world generation. Drawing inspiration from standard computer graphics (CG) solutions in industry, our method integrates with industrial PCG production pipelines. LatticeWorld is simple yet effective framework that seamlessly integrates multimodal LLM with an industry-grade CG rendering engine, the Unreal Engine (UE), distinguishing it from prior works. Compared with Blender, Unreal Engine offers more realistic physics simulation, native multi-agent interaction capabilities, and real-time rendering optimized for interactive experiences. Hence, LatticeWorld inherits UEs distinctive advantages and extended functionality through established plugins. Specifically, LatticeWorld accepts both textual descriptions of the virtual world and visual instructions for terrain elevation (such as height maps or sketches) as inputs. Then, leveraging LLMs capabilities in symbolic understanding and structured sequence generation, the well-tr"

WildScore evaluates MLLMs' symbolic music reasoning through a benchmark of real-world music scores and user-generated queries, revealing both strengths and challenges.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various vision-language tasks. However, their reasoning abilities in the multimodal symbolic music domain remain largely unexplored. We introduce WildScore, the first in-the-wild multimodal symbolic music reasoning and analysis benchmark, designed to evaluate MLLMs' capacity to interpret real-world music scores and answer complex musicological queries. Each instance in WildScore is sourced from genuine musical compositions and accompanied by authentic user-generated questions and discussions, capturing the intricacies of practical music analysis. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we propose a systematic taxonomy, comprising both high-level and fine-grained musicological ontologies. Furthermore, we frame complex music reasoning as multiple-choice question answering, enabling controlled and scalable assessment of MLLMs' symbolic music understanding. Empirical benchmarking of state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildScore reveals intriguing patterns in their visual-symbolic reasoning, uncovering both promising directions and persistent challenges for MLLMs in symbolic music reasoning and analysis. We release the dataset and code.

"LatticeWorld, a 3D world generation framework using lightweight LLMs and Unreal Engine 5, creates dynamic, interactive environments from textual and visual inputs, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a 90times increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.
