We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), simple and flexible paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within single architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily consecutive, future tokens in parallel, key distinction from previous acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables 3-5x reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training. Figure 1 LiveCodeBench-V6 acceleration with Set Block Decoding with no performance reductions. Language model inference consists of two parts: the prefilling and the decoding stages. In the prefilling stage, the prompt is processed simultaneously and its attention keys and values (KVs) are cached, which usually achieves high efficiency on GPUs because thousands of tokens are processed together. In the decoding stage, tokens are sequentially generated one after the other and require the attention KVs of preceding tokens: this stage requires few FLOPs per token, yet the e"
