Text:"5 2 0 2 4 ] . [ 1 4 6 6 4 0 . 9 0 5 2 : r a Adam Tauman Kalai OpenAI Santosh S. Vempala Georgia Tech September 4, 2025 Abstract Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of admitting uncertainty. Such hallucinations persist even in state-of-the-art systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysteriousthey originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are gradedlanguage models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain improves test performance. This epidemic of penalizing uncertain responses can only be addressed through socio-technical mitigation: modifying the scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards, rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems. Language models are known to produce overconfident, plausible falsehoods, which diminish their utility and trustworthiness. This error mode is known as hallucination, though it differs fundamentally from the human perceptual experience. Despite significant progress, hallucinations continue to plague the field, and are still present in the latest models (OpenAI, 2025a). Consider the prompt: What is Adam Tauman Kalais birthday? If you know, just respond with DD-MM. On three separate attempts, state-of-the-art open-source language model1 output three incorrect dates: 03-07, 15-06, and 01-01, even though respo"

A Behavioral Fingerprinting framework evaluates Large Language Models using a Diagnostic Prompt Suite and automated pipeline, revealing divergent alignment behaviors and clustering patterns.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on performance metrics, often failing to capture the nuanced behavioral characteristics that differentiate them. This paper introduces a novel ``Behavioral Fingerprinting'' framework designed to move beyond traditional evaluation by creating a multi-faceted profile of a model's intrinsic cognitive and interactive styles. Using a curated Diagnostic Prompt Suite and an innovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an impartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers. Our results reveal a critical divergence in the LLM landscape: while core capabilities like abstract and causal reasoning are converging among top models, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness vary dramatically. We further document a cross-model default persona clustering (ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives. Taken together, this suggests that a model's interactive nature is not an emergent property of its scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, and highly variable, developer alignment strategies. Our framework provides a reproducible and scalable methodology for uncovering these deep behavioral differences. Project: https://github.com/JarvisPei/Behavioral-Fingerprinting

It uses a Diagnostic Prompt Suite and an automated evaluation pipeline to analyze the cognitive and interactive styles of various models. The study finds that while core reasoning abilities are becoming similar among top models, their alignment behaviors, such as sycophancy and semantic robustness, show significant differences. This indicates that a model's behavior is influenced more by the developers' alignment strategies than by its size or reasoning capabilities.", title='Unveiling the Hidden Behaviors of Language Models'))
