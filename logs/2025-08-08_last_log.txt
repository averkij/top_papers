[ 1 8 1 6 5 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r Learning to Reason for Factuality Xilun Chen1, Ilia Kulikov1, Vincent-Pierre Berges1, Barlas Oğuz1, Rulin Shao2, Gargi Ghosh1, Jason Weston1, Wen-tau Yih1 1FAIR at Meta, 2University of Washington Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant responses. We propose novel reward function that simultaneously considers the factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, 23% increase in answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness. Date: August 8, 2025 Correspondence: Xilun Chen xilun@meta.com The recent emergence of Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 (OpenAI, 2024) and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025b), which invoke Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) thinking process before producing the final response, have significantly advanced LLMs capabilities on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding. One area that has often been overlooked so far in R-LLM research is factuality. This aspect becomes increasingly crucial as the enhanc"

A novel reward function for online reinforcement learning improves factuality and detail in reasoning large language models without reducing helpfulness.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.
