Text:"RPCANet++: Deep Interpretable Robust PCA for Sparse Object Segmentation Fengyi Wu, Yimian Dai, Tianfang Zhang, Yixuan Ding, Jian Yang, Ming-Ming Cheng, Zhenming Peng 1 AbstractRobust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters, and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these limitations, we propose RPCANet++, sparse object segmentation framework that fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our approach unfolds relaxed RPCA model into structured network comprising Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in the BAM, we introduce Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background feature preservation, while Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements.

[ 1 0 9 1 4 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r aOver the past decades, robust principal component analysis (RPCA), as an extension of PCA, has received extensive attention due to its robust representation of outliers. An observed matrix comprises low-rank matrix with redundant features and sparse matrix with distinct objects. Such decomposition structure benefits massive research fields [1] such as low-level vision tasks like image restoration [2] and denoising [3] or high-level vision tasks such as fore/background subtraction [4], image classification [5], and is particularly useful for various practical image segmentation tasks (e.g., defect detection, vessel subtraction, and infrared small target segmentation): by regrading the background with redundant information as and segmented object as the sparse components as: = + (1) Such models are formulated as either convex [6], [7] or nonconvex [8], [9], [10] optimization problems, typically solved using augmented Lagrangian methods [11], proximal gradient descent [12], or alternating direction minimization [13]. To enhance image segmentation performance, these models incorporate various constraints, including object constraints [14], [15], [16], background constraints [17], [18], [19], and field priors [20], [21], [22], among others. However, despite their theoretical appeal, existing models face two key limitations: F. Wu, Y. Ding, and Z.

Manuscript submitted at June, 2025. Computational cost to convergence: Repeated use of costly matrix or tensor operations slows convergence and hinders realtime deployment, especially in memory-constrained settings. Limited generalizability: (1) Heavy reliance on manually tuned hyperparameters leads to performance drops across diverse scenarios; (2) Rigid priors restrict adaptability to different domains, limiting broader applicability. Recent progress in deep neural networks (DNNs) and the availability of large-scale public datasets have advanced object segmentation with greater adaptability to emerging data. Architectures such as FPNs [23], U-Nets [24], Transformers [25], and segment anything model [26] are widely adopted. However, their empirical designs often compromise interpretability, rendering them black boxes whose outputs may be unreliable without domain-specific context. To address the interpretability challenges of DNNs, deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have emerged as distinctive class of model-based approaches. By unrolling iterative optimization algorithms into structured deep networks, DUNs have recently found applications across diverse inverse problems, including compressive sensing [27], [28], as well as image denoising [29], [30], super-resolution [31], [32], and image restoration [33], [34]. Despite growing interest in deep unfolded RPCA models [35], their application to segmentation remains limited. Adapting optimization-based frameworks to high-level vision tasks poses several challengesparticularly in handling key matrix operations such as singular value decomposition (SVD) and softthresholding (ST) under dynamic conditions. While prior studies have proposed variants of SVD/ST and improved initialization strategies [35], [36], efficiently managing complex matrix computations and selecting learnable parameters remains an open issue [37]. Furthermore, although emerging datasets offer ground truth for sparse components, effective supervision of the intermediate low-rank component remains largely unsolved. Furthermore, RPCA can be viewed as decoupling task, where improving low-rank background estimation enhances object detection, and vice versa. However, in DUNs, this reciprocal 2 Fig. 1.

The goal of this work is to address longstanding challenges in achieving highly expressive, controllable, and natural speech generation that faithfully preserves speaker identity across diverse linguistic and emotional contexts. Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of speaker identity and eemotional style, as well as rotational emotional embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, high-quality emotional speech dataset containing 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis were conducted, results show that Marco-Voice delivers competitive performance in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing substantial advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Marco-Voice and https://huggingface.co/datasets/AIDC-AI/CSEMOTIONS respectively. 1.

RPCANet++ combines RPCA with deep learning to achieve efficient and interpretable sparse object segmentation by introducing modules for background approximation, object extraction, and image restoration.  					AI-generated summary 				 Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters, and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation.

A multifunctional speech synthesis system integrates voice cloning and emotion control using speaker-emotion disentanglement and rotational emotional embeddings, achieving high expressive and natural speech.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents a multifunctional speech synthesis system that integrates voice cloning and emotion control speech synthesis within a unified framework. The goal of this work is to address longstanding challenges in achieving highly expressive, controllable, and natural speech generation that faithfully preserves speaker identity across diverse linguistic and emotional contexts. Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of speaker identity and eemotional style, as well as rotational emotional embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality emotional speech dataset containing 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis were conducted, results show that MarcoVoice delivers competitive performance in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis.

"A multifunctional speech synthesis system integrates voice cloning and emotion control using speaker-emotion disentanglement and rotational emotional embeddings, achieving high expressive and natural speech.  					AI-generated summary 				 This paper presents a multifunctional speech synthesis system that integrates voice cloning and emotion control speech synthesis within a unified framework. The goal of this work is to address longstanding challenges in achieving highly expressive, controllable, and natural speech generation that faithfully preserves speaker identity across diverse linguistic and emotional contexts. Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of speaker identity and eemotional style, as well as rotational emotional embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality emotional speech dataset containing 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis were conducted, results show that MarcoVoice delivers competitive performance in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis."
