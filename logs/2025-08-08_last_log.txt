Text:"Attention Basin: Why Contextual Position Matters in Large Language Models Zihao Yi1, Delong Zeng1, *, Zhenqing Ling1, *, Haohao Luo1, Zhe Xu1, Wei Liu2, Jian Luan2, Wanxia Cao2, and Ying Shen1, 1Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China 2MiLM Plus, Xiaomi Inc., Beijing, China 5 2 0 2 7 ] . [ 1 8 2 1 5 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r Abstract The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples), models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), two-stage framework that (i) estimates models intrinsic positional attention preferences using small calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without modifying model parameters or training procedures. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have acquired vast amounts of knowledge from large-scale pretraining corpora and demonstrated exceptional capabilities in understanding and generating natural language. As result, they have achieved remarkable success across wide range of language tasks, from text summarization to multi-turn dialogu"

The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples), models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i) estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without modifying model parameters or training procedures.
