Text:"Are Todays LLMs Ready to Explain Well-Being Concepts? Bohan Jiang1, Dawei Li1, Zhen Tan1, Chengshuai Zhao1, Huan Liu1 1School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, Arizona State University, USA {bjiang14, daweili5, ztan36, czhao93, huanliu}@asu.edu 5 2 0 2 6 ] . [ 1 0 9 9 3 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r Abstract Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, key challenge emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying expertise. In this work, we construct large-scale dataset comprising 43,880 explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We introduce principle-guided LLMas-a-judge evaluation framework, employing dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that finetuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPOand SFT-finetuned models outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks. Introduction Well-being is multi-dimensional concept without single clear and universally accepted definition (Alexandrova 2017). In general, people describe well-being as how people feel and how they function both on personal and social level, and how they evaluate their lives as whole, pointing to complex interplay of mental, physical, and social dimensions (Topp et al. 2015). Gaining clear understanding of well-being concepts is "

Index TermsComplex Video Object Segmentation, MOSEv2 Dataset, Complex Scenes.V IDEO object segmentation (VOS) [1], [2], [3], [4] aims to segment specified target objects throughout the entire video. It is one of the most fundamental and challenging computer vision tasks, playing crucial role in various practical applications involving video analysis and understanding, e.g., autonomous vehicle, augmented reality, and video editing. There are different settings for VOS, for example, semi-supervised VOS [5], [6] that gives the first-frame mask, bounding box, or points of the target object, unsupervised VOS [7], [8] that automatically finds primary or salient objects, and interactive VOS [9], [10] that relies on the users interactions of the target object. VOS has been extensively studied in the past using traditional techniques [11], [12], [13] or deep learning methods [14], [15]. The deep-learningbased methods have greatly improved the VOS performance and surpassed the traditional techniques by large margin. Current state-of-the-art VOS methods [14], [15], [16] have achieved very high performance on two of the most commonlyused VOS datasets DAVIS [2], [3] and YouTube-VOS [4]. For example, XMem [16] achieves 92.0% & on DAVIS 2016 [2], 87.7% & on DAVIS 2017 [3], and 86.1% on YouTubeVOS [4]. With such high performance, it seems that the video Henghui Ding, Kaining Ying, and Yu-Gang Jiang are with Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

Xudong Jiang is with Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Philip H.S. Torr is with University of Oxford, United Kingdom. Henghui Ding and Kaining Ying are co-first authors. object segmentation has been well resolved. However, do we really perceive objects in realistic scenarios? To answer this question, we introduced the coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) dataset in [1], which revisits VOS under more realistic and complex scenes where traditional datasets fall short. In contrast to DAVIS [2], [3] and YouTubeVOS [4], where the target objects are typically salient and isolated, MOSEv1 focuses on challenging cases such as frequent object disappearance and reappearance, small or inconspicuous objects, heavy occlusions, and crowded environments. These real-world conditions significantly affect segmentation performance, with XMem only achieving 57.6% & on MOSEv1. Following its release in 2023, MOSEv1 has quickly attracted attention from the research community. We successfully organized several competitions based on this dataset, including PVUW [17], [18] and LSVOS [19], which have greatly promoted research in this field. series of strong VOS methods such as SAM2 [15] have pushed the performance from initial baselines to 76.4% & , highlighting both the difficulty and the value of the dataset while demonstrating substantial progress in handling complex scenes. In this work, building on the success and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, more challenging dataset that further pushes the boundaries of VOS in real-world environments. MOSEv2 significantly increases the complexity across multiple dimensions. Core challenges from MOSEv1, such as disappearancereappearance dynamics, small or occluded objects, and crowded scenes, are preserved but made more frequent, more challenging, and more realistic. Beyond that, MOSEv2 introduces range of new challenges rarely covered in previous datasets, including adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged ob5 2 0 2 ] .

Text:"Evaluating, Synthesizing, and Enhancing for Customer Support Conversation Jie Zhu1,2*, Huaixia Dou1,2*, Junhui Li1, Lifan Guo2, Feng Chen2, Chi Zhang2, Fang Kong1 1School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University 2Qwen DianJin Team, Alibaba Cloud Computing 5 2 0 2 6 ] . [ 1 3 2 4 4 0 . 8 0 5 2 : r Abstract Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem-solving but also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance, and realworld service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at training customer service supporters to respond using well-defined support strategies. We propose structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines, defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of 1,855 real-world customeragent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem resolution. All code and data will be publicly available at https: //github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin. Customer support aims to help users resolve productor service-related issues through effective and context-aware communication. While large-scale dialogue systems have received growing attention in recent years (Budzianowski et al. 2018; Rashkin et al. 2019; Peskov et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2021), customer support conversations remain underexplored in the NLP community,1"

R-Zero is a self-evolving framework that autonomously generates and learns from its own training data, improving reasoning capabilities in LLMs without human-curated tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels. Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) improves the generalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically rescaling gradients, outperforming standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and showing competitive results in offline reinforcement learning.  					AI-generated summary 				 We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally, our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/yongliang-wu/DFT.

LLMs can be fine-tuned to generate high-quality, audience-tailored explanations of well-being concepts using Supervised Fine-Tuning and Direct Preference Optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying expertise. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 43,880 explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We introduce a principle-guided LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework, employing dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that fine-tuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPO- and SFT-finetuned models outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.

MOSEv2, a more challenging dataset, highlights the limitations of current VOS methods in real-world scenarios with increased complexity and diverse challenges.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2 introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20 representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9% on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly available at https://MOSE.video.

Hi3DEval is a hierarchical evaluation framework for 3D generative content that combines object-level and part-level assessments, including material realism, using a large-scale dataset and hybrid 3D representations.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable alternative to manual evaluations.

Research investigates reasoning failures in language models for multi-hop question answering, introducing a framework to categorize errors and improve model fidelity.  					AI-generated summary 				 The emergence of reasoning models and their integration into practical AI chat bots has led to breakthroughs in solving advanced math, deep search, and extractive question answering problems that requires a complex and multi-step thought process. Yet, a complete understanding of why these models hallucinate more than general purpose language models is missing. In this investigative study, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language models on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced error categorization framework that examines failures across three critical dimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved ("hops"), completeness in capturing relevant information ("coverage"), and cognitive inefficiency ("overthinking"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by complementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error patterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative approach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current models and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity, transparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts.

"Research investigates reasoning failures in language models for multi-hop question answering, introducing a framework to categorize errors and improve model fidelity.  					AI-generated summary 				 The emergence of reasoning models and their integration into practical AI chat bots has led to breakthroughs in solving advanced math, deep search, and extractive question answering problems that requires a complex and multi-step thought process. Yet, a complete understanding of why these models hallucinate more than general purpose language models is missing. In this investigative study, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language models on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced error categorization framework that examines failures across three critical dimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved ("hops"), completeness in capturing relevant information ("coverage"), and cognitive inefficiency ("overthinking"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by complementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error patterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative approach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current models and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity, transparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts."

A structured framework and datasets for training customer service agents using well-defined support strategies improve the quality of customer support interactions and problem resolution.  					AI-generated summary 				 Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance, and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines, defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of 1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.
