Text:"Stanley Z. Hua1 Sanae Lotfi2 Irene Y. Chen1 1UC Berkeley & UCSF 2Meta Superintelligence Labs 6 2 0 F 5 ] . [ 1 1 8 1 6 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r Abstract Post-training quantization reduces the computational cost of large language models but fundamentally alters their social biases in ways that aggregate metrics fail to capture. We present the first large-scale study of 50 quantized models evaluated on PostTrainingBiasBench, unified benchmark of 13 closedand open-ended bias datasets. We identify phenomenon we term quantization-induced masked bias flipping, in which up to 21% of responses flip between biased and unbiased states after quantization, despite showing no change in aggregate bias scores. These flips are strongly driven by model uncertainty, where the responses with high uncertainty are 311 more likely to change than the confident ones. Quantization strength amplifies this effect, with 4-bit quantized models exhibiting 46 more behavioral changes than 8-bit quantized models. Critically, these changes create asymmetric impacts across demographic groups, where bias can worsen by up to 18.6% for some groups while improving by 14.1% for others, yielding misleadingly neutral aggregate outcomes. Larger models show no consistent robustness advantage, and group-specific shifts vary unpredictably across model families. Our findings demonstrate that compression fundamentally alters bias patterns, requiring crucial post-quantization evaluation and interventions to ensure reliability in practice. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is widely applied to make large language models (LLMs) more practical in resource-constrained settings, yet we know surprisingly little about its impact on social bias. While PTQ methods optimize for computational efficiency at the sub-module level, they operate without awareness of downstream behavioral changes; disconnect that requires urgent attention as quantized models become increasingly deployed in healthcare, law, and other high-stakes domains.

Generative Reward Models suffer from deceptive alignment due to outcome accuracy prioritization, but rationale consistency metrics and hybrid training signals improve performance and generalization in RLHF.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) and LLM-as-a-Judge exhibit deceptive alignment by producing correct judgments for incorrect reasons, as they are trained and evaluated to prioritize Outcome Accuracy, which undermines their ability to generalize during RLHF. We introduce Rationale Consistency, a fine-grained metric that quantifies the alignment between the model's reasoning process and human judgment. Our evaluation of frontier models reveals that rationale consistency effectively discriminates among state-of-the-art models and detects deceptive alignment, while outcome accuracy falls short in both respects. To mitigate this gap, we introduce a hybrid signal that combines rationale consistency with outcome accuracy for GenRM training. Our training method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RM-Bench (87.1%) and JudgeBench (82%), surpassing outcome-only baselines by an average of 5%. Using RM during RLHF, our method effectively improves performance as demonstrated on Arena Hard v2, notably yielding a 7% improvement in creative writing tasks. Further analysis confirms that our method escapes the deceptive alignment trap, effectively reversing the decline in rationale consistency observed in outcome-only training.

Post-training quantization of large language models causes significant changes in social biases that aggregate metrics fail to detect, with quantization-induced masked bias flipping occurring more frequently in uncertain responses and stronger quantization levels.  					AI-generated summary 				 Post-training quantization reduces the computational cost of large language models but fundamentally alters their social biases in ways that aggregate metrics fail to capture. We present the first large-scale study of 50 quantized models evaluated on PostTrainingBiasBench, a unified benchmark of 13 closed- and open-ended bias datasets. We identify a phenomenon we term quantization-induced masked bias flipping, in which up to 21% of responses flip between biased and unbiased states after quantization, despite showing no change in aggregate bias scores. These flips are strongly driven by model uncertainty, where the responses with high uncertainty are 3-11x more likely to change than the confident ones. Quantization strength amplifies this effect, with 4-bit quantized models exhibiting 4-6x more behavioral changes than 8-bit quantized models. Critically, these changes create asymmetric impacts across demographic groups, where bias can worsen by up to 18.6% for some groups while improving by 14.1% for others, yielding misleadingly neutral aggregate outcomes. Larger models show no consistent robustness advantage, and group-specific shifts vary unpredictably across model families. Our findings demonstrate that compression fundamentally alters bias patterns, requiring crucial post-quantization evaluation and interventions to ensure reliability in practice.

**Justification:**

- **ETHICS**: The paper directly addresses social biases in language models, fairness across demographic groups, and the ethical implications of quantization-induced bias flipping. It discusses how quantization creates asymmetric impacts across different demographic groups and examines bias patterns systematically.

- **SECURITY**: The paper relates to model robustness and reliability concerns. Quantization-induced masked bias flipping represents a form of model behavior degradation that affects the trustworthiness and safe deployment of quantized models, which falls under security and robustness considerations.

It reveals a phenomenon called quantization-induced masked bias flipping, where responses can switch between biased and unbiased after quantization, even if overall bias metrics remain unchanged.
