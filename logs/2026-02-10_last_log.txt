Text:"6 2 0 2 9 ] . [ 1 4 9 7 8 0 . 2 0 6 2 : r MOVA: Towards Scalable and Synchronized VideoAudio Generation SII-OpenMOSS Team*Audio is indispensable for real-world video, yet generation models have largely overlooked audio components. Current approaches to producing audio-visual content often rely on cascaded pipelines, which increase cost, accumulate errors, and degrade overall quality. While systems such as Veo 3 and Sora 2 emphasize the value of simultaneous generation, joint multimodal modeling introduces unique challenges in architecture, data, and training. Moreover, the closed-source nature of existing systems limits progress in the field. In this work, we introduce MOVA (MOSS Video and Audio), an open-source model capable of generating high-quality, synchronized audio-visual content, including realistic lip-synced speech, environment-aware sound effects, and content-aligned music. MOVA employs Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, with total of 32B parameters, of which 18B are active during inference. It supports IT2VA (Image-Text to Video-Audio) generation task. By releasing the model weights and code, we aim to advance research and foster vibrant community of creators. The released codebase features comprehensive support for efficient inference, LoRA fine-tuning, and prompt enhancement. Blog: https://mosi.cn/models/mova Model: https://huggingface.co/collections/OpenMOSS-Team/mova Code: https://github.com/OpenMOSS/MOVAVideo generation has long been pivotal domain in multimodal generative modeling. Historically, limitations in model capacity, data volume, and scalability hindered these models from achieving practically viable performance. The emergence of the scalable Diffusion Transformer architecture [1] has changed this landscape, giving rise to series of models-including Sora [2], OpenSora [3, 4], Wan [5], and LTX [6]that can generate high-fidelity, realistic videos. Beyond basic video synthesis, these models also demonstrate advanced capabilities such as long video generation [7], controllable synthesis [8], and even few-shot learning and visual reasoning [9, 10]. However, traditional video generation models often neglect the audio component, despite its critical role in multimedia content. Producing videos with synchronized sound typically requires cascaded pipeline[11], e.g., generating video first and then synthesizing audio based on the visuals, or vice versa. Such pipelines inherently limit generation quality, as the audio and video modalities do not interact during synthesis. Endto-end models like Veo3 [12] have demonstrated that high-fidelity audio-visual generation with precise synFull contributors can be found in the Contributors section. 1 Figure 1 Overview of MOVA capabilities. MOVA generates synchronized video and audio across diverse scenarios: multi-speaker speech with precise lip synchronization in both English and Chinese, physical sound effects aligned with visual events, and scene text generation. The model supports both 16:9 and 9:16 aspect ratios. chronization is possible, highlighting the importance of joint audio-video modeling. Similarly, Sora2 [13] exhibits impressive capabilities in generating synchronized audio and video. Yet, all these state-of-the-art systems are closed-source, and subsequent releases such as Wan2.6 [14], Kling Video 3,0 [15], and Seedance 2.0 [16] remain proprietary. As result, the development of high-quality video-audio generation models remains underexplored in the research community. Compared to video-only generation models, video-audio generation models introduce three major challenges: 1. Data Pipeline: Incorporating the audio modality requires fine-grained audio-video captioning pipeline. 2. Modality Fusion: To achieve harmonious and synchronized video-audio generation, these two modalities must mutually integrate information during the generation process. However, simultaneous bimodal generation faces challenges due to disparity in native information density between the two modalities, as well as challenges regarding fusion mechanisms and efficiency. 3. Scalability Verification: Most existing open-source models are evaluated on small-scale architectures and limited datasets [1720], often falling short in achieving high-quality results across both modalities. It remains an open question whether videoaudio models can sustain continuous performance improvements with larger datasets and model scales. In this work, we present MOVA (MOSS Video and Audio), video-audio generation foundation model capable of synthesizing multilingual speech with high-quality lip synchronization, as well as environmental sounds with precise audio-visual alignment. To achieve high-quality video-audio generation, we propose an asymmetric dual-tower architecture, combining pre-trained video tower with pre-trained audio tower. For modality fusion, we employ bidirectional cross-attention mechanism that enables rich interaction between the two modalities. To unleash the potential of this architecture, we construct fine-grained videoaudio annotation pipeline and scale up the training data, resulting in strong performance in synchronized video-audio generation. We observe consistent improvements in both lip synchronization and video-audio alignment metrics as training progresses. As illustrated in Figure 1, MOVA realizes scalable and synchronized video-audio generation. To support research and foster community creation, we release all model weights along with training, inference, and fine-tuning code. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We develop MOVA, synchronized video-audio generation model with an asymmetric dual-tower 2 Figure 2 Model Structure Overview. MOVA couples an A14B video DiT backbone and 1.3B audio DiT backbone via 2.6B bidirectional Bridge module. architecture that leverages pre-trained video and audio generation models. We design fine-grained audio-video captioning pipeline to produce high-quality bimodal training data at scale. By scaling video-audio training, we achieve continuous improvements in synchronization performance across both modalities.We consider joint generation of temporally aligned video-audio pairs from text prompt (optionally with first-frame image for I2VA).

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables variable computation, it scales memory linearly and is ill-suited for continuous action spaces. We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process. At inference, RD-VLA dynamically allocates compute using an adaptive stopping criterion based on latent convergence. Experiments on challenging manipulation tasks show that recurrent depth is critical: tasks that fail entirely (0% success) with single-iteration inference exceed 90% success with four iterations, while simpler tasks saturate rapidly. RDVLA provides scalable path to test-time compute in robotics, replacing token-based reasoning with latent reasoning to achieve constant memory usage and up to 80 inference speedup over prior reasoning-based VLA models. I. INTRODUCTION Humans do not operate with fixed computational budget. When performing trivial maneuvers, such as adjusting grip or nudging an object, we rely on near-reflexive, low-effort responses. However, when environments become cluttered"

Modern machine learning and large language models support literature analysis, hypothesis generation, experimental planning, and data interpretation across biology, chemistry, and earth science. These advances have inspired AI Scientist systems that coordinate computational modeling, laboratory experimentation, and cross disciplinary reasoning to accelerate scientific progress. However, existing AI Scientist systems remain limited by domain specific designs, incomplete reasoning abilities, naive optimization pipelines, and insufficient support for long horizon autonomous operation. We introduce InternAgent-1.5, unified system designed for end-to-end scientific discovery across computational and empirical domains. The system is built on structured architecture composed of three coordinated subsystems for generation, verification, and evolution. These subsystems are supported by foundational capabilities for deep research, solution optimization, and long horizon memory. The architecture allows InternAgent-1.5 to operate continuously across extended discovery cycles while maintaining coherent and improving behavior. It also enables the system to coordinate computational modeling and laboratory experimentation within single unified system. We evaluate InternAgent-1.5 on scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GAIA, HLE, GPQA, and FrontierScience, and the system achieves leading performance that demonstrates strong foundational capabilities. Beyond these benchmarks, we further assess two categories of discovery tasks. In algorithm discovery tasks, InternAgent-1.5 autonomously designs competitive methods for core machine learning problems. In emp"

To effectively steer the world models exploration, we introduce three core innovations tailored to the autoregressive video generation paradigm: 1) Clip-level rollout Strategy: We generate and evaluate multiple samples at single target clip, which significantly boosts rollout efficiency and provides fine-grained reward signals. 2) Complementary Reward Functions: We design reward functions for both interactionfollowing accuracy and visual quality, which provide direct supervision and effectively suppress reward-hacking behaviors. 3) Efficient RL Algorithm: We employ the negative-aware finetuning strategy coupled with various efficiency optimizations to efficiently and effectively enhance model capacity. Evaluations on the SoTA open-source world model, WorldPlay, demonstrate that WorldCompass significantly improves interaction accuracy and visual fidelity across various scenarios. Project page and online demo can be found: https://3d-models.hunyuan. tencent.com/world/ 1. Introduction World models enable humans or agents to interact with generative world environments. The emergence of Cosmos (Agarwal et al., 2025; Ali et al., 2025; Azzolini et al., 2025), HY-World (HunyuanWorld, 2025; Huang et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2025) and Genie series (Bruce et al., 2024; ParkerHolder et al., 2024; Ball et al., 2025), have significantly advanced the field, demonstrating the profound impact of video-based world models on both fundamental AI research and practical generative media applications (Liao et al., 1Zhejiang University 2Tencent Hunyuan 3The University of Hong Kong. Correspondence to: Chunchao Guo <chunchaoguo@gmail.com>, Zhou Zhao <zhaozhou@zju.edu.cn>. Preprint. February 10, 2026. 2025; Liu et al., 2025c; Ding et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025c; Liu et al., 2025d; Team et al., 2025a; Li et al., 2025b). However, despite this immense potential, current opensource video-based world model solutions remain predominantly confined to the pre-training stage. These methods (Tang et al., 2025; He et al., 2025c; Sun et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025) typically rely on pixel supervision from raw visual data to implicitly learn how to follow input actions. In this work, we focus on post-training for long-horizon video-based world models. We attempt to employ reinforcement learning (RL) to more directly teach the model to explore the world with better accuracy and consistency, grounded in interaction signals. To achieve this, we propose WorldCompass, novel RL framework specifically designed to steer the world exploration. Specifically, we redesign each stages of RL process, grounding them in the autoregressive, interactive and long-horizon generation paradigm of world model. 1) We introduce cliplevel rollout for autoregressive video generation. This strategy significantly boosts both rollout efficiency and the granularity of the reward signal. Besides, it compels the model to rely on its own imperfect predictions, thus effectively mitigating the challenge of exposure bias. 2) We design two complementary reward functions tailored to the main characteristics of world modeling: action following and visual quality of the generated content. This complementary reward feedback effectively suppresses reward hacking. 3) We utilize the negative-aware fine-tuning strategy for RL training, supplemented by suite of multi-faceted efficiency optimizations. Together, these methods drive the autoregressive video model toward the desired direction, ensuring both robust learning and computational feasibility. We evaluate the WorldCompass framework by performing post-training on WorldPlay (Sun et al., 2025), recent state-of-the-art open-source world model. Through comprehensive evaluation, we find that our RL training substantially improves the models interaction accuracy and visual quality across various scenarios: varying durations (from short-term to long-term), and different action complexities (basic actions or composite actions). This comprehensive improvement demonstrates that WorldCompass possesses high generalizability and effectively strengthens the models fundamental capabilities. WorldCompass: Reinforcement Learning for Long-Horizon World Models Our contribution can be summarized as follows: 2.2. Reinforcement Learning We highlight the value of post-training for advanced world models and introduce WorldCompass, novel RL framework specifically designed for video-based world models. We dive into the autoregressive, interactive and longhorizon characteristics of the world model, redesigning the RL framework to achieve efficient training and fine-grained feedback signals. We provide comprehensive evaluation on WorldPlay, demonstrating that RL post-training significantly enhances the capabilities of this state-of-the-art opensource world model across various scenarios. 2. Related Work 2.1. Video-based World Model World model aims to predict future states, adhering to physical and geometric laws based on current and past observations and actions. It enables users or agents to interact with any environment. The recent Genie series (Bruce et al., 2024; Parker-Holder et al., 2024; Ball et al., 2025) demonstrate the significant potential of video-based world models in embodied intelligence and content creation. This approach utilizes video generation model (Google, 2025; Wu et al., 2025; Wan et al., 2025) to interactively generate videos and explore the world by subjecting the generation process to discrete action signal. This intrinsic need for interactive exploration requires the generation process to be autoregressive and long-horizon, and simultaneously demands precise fidelity to diverse action control conditions. Recent work revolves around these requirements. Diffusion Forcing (Chen et al., 2024) enables the autoregressive generation of long video clips by using variable timesteps during training. Another line of works (Wang et al., 2024; He et al., 2024; Valevski et al., 2024) embed discrete or continuo"

Various benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate such agents. However, existing benchmarks often construct queries backward from answers, producing unnatural tasks misaligned with real-world needs. Moreover, these benchmarks tend to focus on either locating specific information or aggregating information from multiple sources, while relying on static answer sets prone to data contamination. To bridge these gaps, we introduce GISA, benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistants comprising 373 human-crafted queries that reflect authentic information-seeking scenarios. GISA features four structured answer formats (item, set, list, and table), enabling deterministic evaluation. It integrates both deep reasoning and broad information aggregation within unified tasks, and includes live subset with periodically updated answers to resist memorization. Notably, GISA provides complete human search trajectories for every query, offering gold-standard references for process-level supervision and imitation learning. Experiments on mainstream LLMs and commercial search products reveal that even the best-performing model achieves only 19.30% exact match score, with performance notably degrading on tasks requiring complex planning and comprehensive information gathering. These findings highlight substantial room for future improvement. # Contact: yutaozhu94@gmail.com, dou@ruc.edu.cn Code: https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/GISA L"

In this report, we introduce SoulX-Singer, high-quality open-source SVS system designed with practical deployment considerations in mind. SoulX-Singer supports controllable singing generation conditioned on either symbolic musical scores (MIDI) or melodic representations, enabling flexible and expressive control in real-world production workflows. Trained on more than 42,000 hours of vocal data, the system supports Mandarin Chinese, English, and Cantonese, and consistently achieves state-of-the-art synthesis quality across languages under diverse musical conditions. Furthermore, to enable reliable evaluation of zero-shot SVS performance in practical scenarios, we construct SoulX-Singer-Eval, dedicated benchmark with strict trainingtest disentanglement, facilitating systematic assessment in zero-shot settings.

Despite 5s training duration, Rolling Sink effectively scales the AR video synthesis to minutes long during testing, e.g, 5-minute and 30-minute (please see Fig. S28, S29 in our Supp1). Abstract. Recently, autoregressive (AR) video diffusion models has achieved remarkable performance. However, due to their limited training durations, train-test gap emerges when testing at longer horizons, leading to rapid visual degradations. Following Self Forcing, which studies the train-test gap within the training duration, this work studies the train-test gap beyond the training duration, i.e., the gap between the limited horizons during training and open-ended horizons during testing. Since open-ended testing can extend beyond any finite training window, and long-video training is computationally expensive, we pursue training-free solution to bridge this gap. To explore training-free Corresponding author. 1 Supp: Supplementary Material.

MOVA is an open-source model that generates synchronized audio-visual content using a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with 32 billion parameters, supporting image-text to video-audio generation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Audio is indispensable for real-world video, yet generation models have largely overlooked audio components. Current approaches to producing audio-visual content often rely on cascaded pipelines, which increase cost, accumulate errors, and degrade overall quality. While systems such as Veo 3 and Sora 2 emphasize the value of simultaneous generation, joint multimodal modeling introduces unique challenges in architecture, data, and training. Moreover, the closed-source nature of existing systems limits progress in the field. In this work, we introduce MOVA (MOSS Video and Audio), an open-source model capable of generating high-quality, synchronized audio-visual content, including realistic lip-synced speech, environment-aware sound effects, and content-aligned music. MOVA employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, with a total of 32B parameters, of which 18B are active during inference. It supports IT2VA (Image-Text to Video-Audio) generation task. By releasing the model weights and code, we aim to advance research and foster a vibrant community of creators. The released codebase features comprehensive support for efficient inference, LoRA fine-tuning, and prompt enhancement.

LLaDA2.1 introduces a novel token-to-token editing approach with speed and quality modes, enhanced through reinforcement learning for improved reasoning and instruction following in large language diffusion models.  					AI-generated summary 				 While LLaDA2.0 showcased the scaling potential of 100B-level block-diffusion models and their inherent parallelization, the delicate equilibrium between decoding speed and generation quality has remained an elusive frontier. Today, we unveil LLaDA2.1, a paradigm shift designed to transcend this trade-off. By seamlessly weaving Token-to-Token (T2T) editing into the conventional Mask-to-Token (M2T) scheme, we introduce a joint, configurable threshold-decoding scheme. This structural innovation gives rise to two distinct personas: the Speedy Mode (S Mode), which audaciously lowers the M2T threshold to bypass traditional constraints while relying on T2T to refine the output; and the Quality Mode (Q Mode), which leans into conservative thresholds to secure superior benchmark performances with manageable efficiency degrade. Furthering this evolution, underpinned by an expansive context window, we implement the first large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework specifically tailored for dLLMs, anchored by specialized techniques for stable gradient estimation. This alignment not only sharpens reasoning precision but also elevates instruction-following fidelity, bridging the chasm between diffusion dynamics and complex human intent. We culminate this work by releasing LLaDA2.1-Mini (16B) and LLaDA2.1-Flash (100B). Across 33 rigorous benchmarks, LLaDA2.1 delivers strong task performance and lightning-fast decoding speed. Despite its 100B volume, on coding tasks it attains an astounding 892 TPS on HumanEval+, 801 TPS on BigCodeBench, and 663 TPS on LiveCodeBench.

Financial markets are noisy and non-stationary, making alpha mining highly sensitive to noise in backtesting results and sudden market regime shifts. While recent agentic frameworks improve alpha mining automation, they often lack controllable multi-round search and reliable reuse of validated experience. To address these challenges, we propose QuantaAlpha, an evolutionary alpha mining framework that treats each end-to-end mining run as a trajectory and improves factors through trajectory-level mutation and crossover operations. QuantaAlpha localizes suboptimal steps in each trajectory for targeted revision and recombines complementary high-reward segments to reuse effective patterns, enabling structured exploration and refinement across mining iterations. During factor generation, QuantaAlpha enforces semantic consistency across the hypothesis, factor expression, and executable code, while constraining the complexity and redundancy of the generated factor to mitigate crowding. Extensive experiments on the China Securities Index 300 (CSI 300) demonstrate consistent gains over strong baseline models and prior agentic systems. When utilizing GPT-5.2, QuantaAlpha achieves an Information Coefficient (IC) of 0.1501, with an Annualized Rate of Return (ARR) of 27.75% and a Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 7.98%. Moreover, factors mined on CSI 300 transfer effectively to the China Securities Index 500 (CSI 500) and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500), delivering 160% and 137% cumulative excess return over four years, respectively, which indicates strong robustness of QuantaAlpha under market distribution shifts.

RD-VLA introduces a recurrent architecture for vision-language-action models that adapts computational depth through latent iterative refinement, achieving constant memory usage and improved task success rates.  					AI-generated summary 				 Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on fixed computational depth, expending the same amount of compute on simple adjustments and complex multi-step manipulation. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables variable computation, it scales memory linearly and is ill-suited for continuous action spaces. We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs a recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with a constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process. At inference, RD-VLA dynamically allocates compute using an adaptive stopping criterion based on latent convergence. Experiments on challenging manipulation tasks show that recurrent depth is critical: tasks that fail entirely (0 percent success) with single-iteration inference exceed 90 percent success with four iterations, while simpler tasks saturate rapidly. RD-VLA provides a scalable path to test-time compute in robotics, replacing token-based reasoning with latent reasoning to achieve constant memory usage and up to 80x inference speedup over prior reasoning-based VLA models.

Researchers introduce a new video understanding task and benchmark that evaluates models' ability to learn from few-shot demonstrations, along with a specialized MLLM architecture trained using a two-stage approach combining video supervision and preference optimization.  					AI-generated summary 				 Despite the growing video understanding capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), existing video benchmarks primarily assess understanding based on models' static, internal knowledge, rather than their ability to learn and adapt from dynamic, novel contexts from few examples. To bridge this gap, we present Demo-driven Video In-Context Learning, a novel task focused on learning from in-context demonstrations to answer questions about the target videos. Alongside this, we propose Demo-ICL-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate demo-driven video in-context learning capabilities. Demo-ICL-Bench is constructed from 1200 instructional YouTube videos with associated questions, from which two types of demonstrations are derived: (i) summarizing video subtitles for text demonstration; and (ii) corresponding instructional videos as video demonstrations. To effectively tackle this new challenge, we develop Demo-ICL, an MLLM with a two-stage training strategy: video-supervised fine-tuning and information-assisted direct preference optimization, jointly enhancing the model's ability to learn from in-context examples. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs confirm the difficulty of Demo-ICL-Bench, demonstrate the effectiveness of Demo-ICL, and thereby unveil future research directions.

InternAgent-1.5 is a unified system for autonomous scientific discovery that integrates computational modeling and experimental research through coordinated subsystems for generation, verification, and evolution.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce InternAgent-1.5, a unified system designed for end-to-end scientific discovery across computational and empirical domains. The system is built on a structured architecture composed of three coordinated subsystems for generation, verification, and evolution. These subsystems are supported by foundational capabilities for deep research, solution optimization, and long horizon memory. The architecture allows InternAgent-1.5 to operate continuously across extended discovery cycles while maintaining coherent and improving behavior. It also enables the system to coordinate computational modeling and laboratory experimentation within a single unified system. We evaluate InternAgent-1.5 on scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GAIA, HLE, GPQA, and FrontierScience, and the system achieves leading performance that demonstrates strong foundational capabilities. Beyond these benchmarks, we further assess two categories of discovery tasks. In algorithm discovery tasks, InternAgent-1.5 autonomously designs competitive methods for core machine learning problems. In empirical discovery tasks, it executes complete computational or wet lab experiments and produces scientific findings in earth, life, biological, and physical domains. Overall, these results show that InternAgent-1.5 provides a general and scalable framework for autonomous scientific discovery.

WorldCompass enhances long-horizon video-based world models through reinforcement learning post-training with clip-level rollouts, complementary rewards, and efficient RL algorithms.  					AI-generated summary 				 This work presents WorldCompass, a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training framework for the long-horizon, interactive video-based world models, enabling them to explore the world more accurately and consistently based on interaction signals. To effectively "steer" the world model's exploration, we introduce three core innovations tailored to the autoregressive video generation paradigm: 1) Clip-level rollout Strategy: We generate and evaluate multiple samples at a single target clip, which significantly boosts rollout efficiency and provides fine-grained reward signals. 2) Complementary Reward Functions: We design reward functions for both interaction-following accuracy and visual quality, which provide direct supervision and effectively suppress reward-hacking behaviors. 3) Efficient RL Algorithm: We employ the negative-aware fine-tuning strategy coupled with various efficiency optimizations to efficiently and effectively enhance model capacity. Evaluations on the SoTA open-source world model, WorldPlay, demonstrate that WorldCompass significantly improves interaction accuracy and visual fidelity across various scenarios.

To effectively "steer" the world model's exploration, we introduce three core innovations tailored to the autoregressive video generation paradigm: 1) Clip-level rollout Strategy: We generate and evaluate multiple samples at a single target clip, which significantly boosts rollout efficiency and provides fine-grained reward signals. 2) Complementary Reward Functions: We design reward functions for both interaction-following accuracy and visual quality, which provide direct supervision and effectively suppress reward-hacking behaviors. 3) Efficient RL Algorithm: We employ the negative-aware fine-tuning strategy coupled with various efficiency optimizations to efficiently and effectively enhance model capacity. Evaluations on the SoTA open-source world model, WorldPlay, demonstrate that WorldCompass significantly improves interaction accuracy and visual fidelity across various scenarios."

WildReward demonstrates that reward models can be effectively trained from in-the-wild user interactions using ordinal regression, achieving performance comparable to traditional methods while benefiting from user diversity.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reward models (RMs) are crucial for the training of large language models (LLMs), yet they typically rely on large-scale human-annotated preference pairs. With the widespread deployment of LLMs, in-the-wild interactions have emerged as a rich source of implicit reward signals. This raises the question: Can we develop reward models directly from in-the-wild interactions? In this work, we explore this possibility by adopting WildChat as an interaction source and proposing a pipeline to extract reliable human feedback, yielding 186k high-quality instances for training WildReward via ordinal regression directly on user feedback without preference pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WildReward achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to conventional reward models, with improved calibration and cross-sample consistency. We also observe that WildReward benefits directly from user diversity, where more users yield stronger reward models. Finally, we apply WildReward to online DPO training and observe significant improvements across various tasks. Code and data are released at https://github.com/THU-KEG/WildReward.

A scalable framework for evaluating and improving goal-conditioned procedure generation using large-scale web mining, automated scoring, and reinforcement learning to enhance step-by-step instruction quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generating step-by-step "how-to" procedures is a key LLM capability: how-to advice is commonly requested in chatbots, and step-by-step planning is critical for reasoning over complex tasks. Yet, measuring and improving procedural validity at scale on real-world tasks remains challenging and understudied. To address this, we introduce How2Everything, a scalable framework to evaluate and improve goal-conditioned procedure generation. Our framework includes How2Mine, which mines 351K procedures from 980K web pages across 14 topics and readily scales to larger corpora. From this pool we build How2Bench, a 7K-example evaluation set balanced across topics. To reliably score model outputs, we develop How2Score, an evaluation protocol that uses an LLM judge to detect whether a generation contains any critical failure that would prevent achieving the goal. For low-cost, reproducible evaluation, we distill a frontier model into an open 8B model, achieving 80.5% agreement with human annotators. How2Bench reveals clear scaling trends across model sizes and training stages, providing signal early in pretraining. Finally, RL using How2Score as a reward improves performance on How2Bench by >10 points across three models without systematic regressions on standard benchmarks, with gains robust to superficial source-document memorization or format compliance. Taken together, How2Everything shows how pretraining web data can support a closed loop of capability evaluation and improvement at scale.

"A scalable framework for evaluating and improving goal-conditioned procedure generation using large-scale web mining, automated scoring, and reinforcement learning to enhance step-by-step instruction quality.  					AI-generated summary 				 Generating step-by-step "how-to" procedures is a key LLM capability: how-to advice is commonly requested in chatbots, and step-by-step planning is critical for reasoning over complex tasks. Yet, measuring and improving procedural validity at scale on real-world tasks remains challenging and understudied. To address this, we introduce How2Everything, a scalable framework to evaluate and improve goal-conditioned procedure generation. Our framework includes How2Mine, which mines 351K procedures from 980K web pages across 14 topics and readily scales to larger corpora. From this pool we build How2Bench, a 7K-example evaluation set balanced across topics. To reliably score model outputs, we develop How2Score, an evaluation protocol that uses an LLM judge to detect whether a generation contains any critical failure that would prevent achieving the goal. For low-cost, reproducible evaluation, we distill a frontier model into an open 8B model, achieving 80.5% agreement with human annotators. How2Bench reveals clear scaling trends across model sizes and training stages, providing signal early in pretraining. Finally, RL using How2Score as a reward improves performance on How2Bench by >10 points across three models without systematic regressions on standard benchmarks, with gains robust to superficial source-document memorization or format compliance. Taken together, How2Everything shows how pretraining web data can support a closed loop of capability evaluation and improvement at scale."

A new benchmark called GISA is introduced for evaluating information-seeking assistants, featuring human-crafted queries with structured answer formats and live updates to prevent memorization.  					AI-generated summary 				 The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly accelerated the development of search agents capable of autonomously gathering information through multi-turn web interactions. Various benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate such agents. However, existing benchmarks often construct queries backward from answers, producing unnatural tasks misaligned with real-world needs. Moreover, these benchmarks tend to focus on either locating specific information or aggregating information from multiple sources, while relying on static answer sets prone to data contamination. To bridge these gaps, we introduce GISA, a benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistants comprising 373 human-crafted queries that reflect authentic information-seeking scenarios. GISA features four structured answer formats (item, set, list, and table), enabling deterministic evaluation. It integrates both deep reasoning and broad information aggregation within unified tasks, and includes a live subset with periodically updated answers to resist memorization. Notably, GISA provides complete human search trajectories for every query, offering gold-standard references for process-level supervision and imitation learning. Experiments on mainstream LLMs and commercial search products reveal that even the best-performing model achieves only 19.30\% exact match score, with performance notably degrading on tasks requiring complex planning and comprehensive information gathering. These findings highlight substantial room for future improvement.

A high-quality open-source singing voice synthesis system is presented with support for multiple languages and controllable generation, along with a dedicated benchmark for evaluating zero-shot performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 While recent years have witnessed rapid progress in speech synthesis, open-source singing voice synthesis (SVS) systems still face significant barriers to industrial deployment, particularly in terms of robustness and zero-shot generalization. In this report, we introduce SoulX-Singer, a high-quality open-source SVS system designed with practical deployment considerations in mind. SoulX-Singer supports controllable singing generation conditioned on either symbolic musical scores (MIDI) or melodic representations, enabling flexible and expressive control in real-world production workflows. Trained on more than 42,000 hours of vocal data, the system supports Mandarin Chinese, English, and Cantonese and consistently achieves state-of-the-art synthesis quality across languages under diverse musical conditions. Furthermore, to enable reliable evaluation of zero-shot SVS performance in practical scenarios, we construct SoulX-Singer-Eval, a dedicated benchmark with strict training-test disentanglement, facilitating systematic assessment in zero-shot settings.

Autoregressive video diffusion models suffer from train-test gaps when generating long videos, but a training-free approach called Rolling Sink addresses this by maintaining AR cache and enabling ultra-long video synthesis.  					AI-generated summary 				 Recently, autoregressive (AR) video diffusion models has achieved remarkable performance. However, due to their limited training durations, a train-test gap emerges when testing at longer horizons, leading to rapid visual degradations. Following Self Forcing, which studies the train-test gap within the training duration, this work studies the train-test gap beyond the training duration, i.e., the gap between the limited horizons during training and open-ended horizons during testing. Since open-ended testing can extend beyond any finite training window, and long-video training is computationally expensive, we pursue a training-free solution to bridge this gap. To explore a training-free solution, we conduct a systematic analysis of AR cache maintenance. These insights lead to Rolling Sink. Built on Self Forcing (trained on only 5s clips), Rolling Sink effectively scales the AR video synthesis to ultra-long durations (e.g., 5-30 minutes at 16 FPS) at test time, with consistent subjects, stable colors, coherent structures, and smooth motions. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, Rolling Sink achieves superior long-horizon visual fidelity and temporal consistency compared to SOTA baselines.

SPARSE is a user-centric framework that protects text embeddings from privacy leaks by selectively perturbing sensitive dimensions using differentiable masking and Mahalanobis noise calibration.  					AI-generated summary 				 Text embeddings enable numerous NLP applications but face severe privacy risks from embedding inversion attacks, which can expose sensitive attributes or reconstruct raw text. Existing differential privacy defenses assume uniform sensitivity across embedding dimensions, leading to excessive noise and degraded utility. We propose SPARSE, a user-centric framework for concept-specific privacy protection in text embeddings. SPARSE combines (1) differentiable mask learning to identify privacy-sensitive dimensions for user-defined concepts, and (2) the Mahalanobis mechanism that applies elliptical noise calibrated by dimension sensitivity. Unlike traditional spherical noise injection, SPARSE selectively perturbs privacy-sensitive dimensions while preserving non-sensitive semantics. Evaluated across six datasets with three embedding models and attack scenarios, SPARSE consistently reduces privacy leakage while achieving superior downstream performance compared to state-of-the-art DP methods.

Wait, let me reconsider. Looking at the paper more carefully:

- **DATA**: The paper focuses on protecting and processing text embeddings, which relates to data privacy and curation
- **TRAINING**: The paper proposes methods for improving model training through differentiable mask learning and noise calibration mechanisms

Actually, this paper is primarily about privacy protection in embeddings rather than data processing/curation or training improvements in the traditional sense.

Let me reconsider once more - the core contribution is a framework for privacy-preserving text embeddings:

```python

This best fits under DATA as it addresses data protection and privacy in the context of text embeddings, which is a data-centric concern.

Aster is an AI agent that accelerates scientific discovery by iteratively improving programs, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple domains including mathematics, biology, and machine learning with significantly reduced computational requirements.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Aster, an AI agent for autonomous scientific discovery capable of operating over 20 times faster than existing frameworks. Given a task, an initial program, and a script to evaluate the performance of the program, Aster iteratively improves the program, often leading to new state-of-the-art performances. Aster's significant reduction in the number of iterations required for novel discovery expands the domain of tractable problems to include tasks with long evaluation durations, such as multi-hour machine learning training runs.   We applied Aster to problems in mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, biology, neuroscience, and language model training. More specifically: the Erdos minimum overlap problem, optimizing the TriMul kernel, a single-cell analysis denoising problem, training a neural activity prediction model to perform well on ZAPBench, and the NanoGPT Speedrun Competition. Aster attains SOTA results in every task, except for ZAPBench, where it matches the performance of the best human solution with less than 1/190th of the compute.

"Aster is an AI agent that accelerates scientific discovery by iteratively improving programs, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple domains including mathematics, biology, and machine learning with significantly reduced computational requirements.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce Aster, an AI agent for autonomous scientific discovery capable of operating over 20 times faster than existing frameworks. Given a task, an initial program, and a script to evaluate the performance of the program, Aster iteratively improves the program, often leading to new state-of-the-art performances. Aster's significant reduction in the number of iterations required for novel discovery expands the domain of tractable problems to include tasks with long evaluation durations, such as multi-hour machine learning training runs.   We applied Aster to problems in mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, biology, neuroscience, and language model training. More specifically: the Erdos minimum overlap problem, optimizing the TriMul kernel, a single-cell analysis denoising problem, training a neural activity prediction model to perform well on ZAPBench, and the NanoGPT Speedrun Competition. Aster attains SOTA results in every task, except for ZAPBench, where it matches the performance of the best human solution with less than 1/190th of the compute.   Aster is accessible via a web interface and API at asterlab.ai."
